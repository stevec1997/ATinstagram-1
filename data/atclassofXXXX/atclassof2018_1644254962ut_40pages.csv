But at the end of the day it was accomplished by doing very simple, ordinary things every day. I woke up and put one foot in front of the other. I ate when I was hungry. Drank when I was thirsty. And found a flat piece of ground to lay my head at night. The simplicity of those 6 months is what made them the best 6 months of my life.

But our hope is to strap on a backpack as soon as each child is physically able and emotionally ready.

A press for something more meaningful spurred Jukebox out of her desk job in 2017, and she hasn't turned back since. Apart from becoming a full-time Yogi, traveling the globe, and living in places like SE Asia, she's raised money – a lot money ($5000 for @hikeformentalhealth , $25,000 for scholarships to @thehillsideschool for learning disabled students) – while hiking the AT and PCT. Put simply, Jukebox is amazing, and we're glad to have her on board this week.<br><br>Have a question for Devin/Jukebox? Head to our site to start the convo."

I spent the night prior in San Diego with @nothingiscasual, doing a final pack shakedown and anxiously cutting grams from my baseweight. I barely slept that night - I knew this time, I was walking away from my life in D.C. with no plans of returning. We arrived at the trailhead just as the sun was rising. I had seen photos of the PCT monument many times before, but seeing it in person and signing my name in the logbook was surreal. We said our goodbyes and parted ways. All of the chaos in the months leading up was over. Things had finally slowed down and I was alone with my thoughts. I found solace stepping my feet in the sand and feeling the desert sun on my skin. At mile 15, I met @donkreitz12 and had lunch near a small stream. Little did I know that we would yo-yo back and forth until the Sierras where we would then walk the rest of the trail together #TheBlob. It took 700 miles to let go of trying to recreate my AT experience. I thruhiked the AT to prove something to myself - that I had what it takes and could do it alone. I felt lost without purpose on the PCT. The Sierras were my turning point. I grew dependent emotionally and physically on the hikers around me. It was a team sport - waking up together at 3am to navigate over passes on hard snow and fording streams before they became impassable with roaring white water as the snow melt. These people, these shared experiences were what I was searching for and ultimately were the stepping stones to determine what I needed in a home post-trail. It may have taken two thruhikes to lead me to a place and point in my life where I could balance my passions with stability. And I know one day, I’ll be itching to hike the CDT to complete the triple crown 👑👑👑 But for now, my heart is full exploring trails close to home and growing my community here in Salt Lake! #thruhikingwillruinyourlife ❤️"

Here is an example of a typical trail logistics discussion. I remember coming up to a violent water crossing on the side of a mountain. Some familiar faces were on the other side by the time Trainwreck and I arrived. Some were wringing out their socks. Others putting their packs back on. Others (Big Ben) just waiting for the next cast of hikers ready to take their shot. I must have bumped record as I put my phone back into my pocket. You can hear TW offering some unsound advice, Big Ben telling me the options and how others had fared, and Jukebox telling me what DEFINITELY DID NOT work for her (""I'm soaking wet!""). Before the video stops I asked the others what they did. I can't remember exactly how it ended, but I know I didn't fall in, and my phone still worked at the end. Listen to the water and the metal tips on my trekking poles trying their best to grip any part of the slick rocks. I miss it.

I told my parents in January of 2017 that I intended to start the AT in March of 2018. After the initial ""you're taking a gun, right?"" discussion, he IMMEDIATELY became a trail dad. He was online reading articles and posts. He got on the AT weather app. He watched for closures and other announcements. He followed every single day of my hike by sitting down each night and opening the binder that held a large printed version of AWOL. He would write down the date, my start and end time, and a quick note about anything I bitched about or was excited about that day. On the way from PA to OH, he swung thru GA to drop me off at the start. My parents later traveled to Virginia to meet my tramily and ME to pick me up in Baxter. While we were passing thru PA, he was an integral part of the ""Hack Pack"", during which my tramily stayed with members of my family each night after slack packing each day for over two weeks. He continued to help hikers for the rest of '18 and didn't stop when the class of '19 came thru. He welcomed strangers into their home anytime I picked up the phone and asked him to. He offered advice and assistance at every turn. The biggest reason I was able to complete my hike was the work ethic he instilled in me when I was growing up. From a young age, he guided me with a ""get it done"" mentality. Do what it takes, whatever that may be. Be mentally strong and the physical follows. Not being able to enjoy the 2020 class was heartbreaking for both of my parents, but dad was especially saddened by the AT closure. Anyone whose trail crossed with his is better for it. Thank you to all of the hikers that met him and made him feel so connected to our community. It meant so much to him and brought him so much joy...no matter how bad you smelled.<br><br>#appalachiantrail #at2018 #atclassof2018 #hiking #outdoors #dad #at2019 #atclassof2019"

It was amazing. As I hiked down from the top toward Newfound Gap it started to warm up enough for the snow to start melting and turn into slush.

This was my first full day on trail and was full of ups and downs, both literally and figuratively. The day started as a frustrating one, I was one of the last ones to finish packing up and hit the trail because I didn’t have routine yet, I also had to deal with the sore muscles from 15 miles the day before and my body REALLY wasn’t used to what I was doing. That night we also had a huge thunderstorm roll through camp and I ended having to literally hold my tarp down from flying off in the wind. I really questioned my choice of gear, going with a hammock and tarp instead of a tent after that. But, I also meet a bunch of fellow hikers heading north throughout the day and got some much needed encouragement and confidence after we decided to camp together that night. I also got my first trail magic at Woody gap which really lifted my spirits and saw some great views from Big Cedar Cliffs. All in all, it was a day I remember more then most because of its challenges as much as the good stuff. #atclassof2018 #at #applachiantrail #hiking #backpacking #adventure #thruhike #thruhiker"

This one is for @adventurous_als . I met Flower Power and Quick Fix during our respective southbound thruhikes in October of 2018. I was maybe two whole weeks ahead of them, but was home for a few days for my cousin's wedding (I live in a trail town). I was getting a few things from the grocery store and saw these two strangers who were clearly thruhikers (always a happy sighting). I told them I was hiking too but just taking a few days off, and asked if they needed anything. They accepted a ride from the store to the motel they splurged on for Quick Fix's birthday. That was the only time I saw them in person, but it was such a happy encounter, and I've enjoyed keeping in touch and seeing all their grand adventures! You never know who you'll meet on your journey or how they will effect you, but I'm pretty sure I remember almost every single person I talked with on the trail. What a vivid dream that was.<br><br>PS: currently open for commissions!<br><br>#watercolor #adventure #adventureart #hiking #handstand #atclassof2018 #at2018 #sobo #southbound #giveaway #art #appalachiantrail #hikerlife #hikingcommunity #trailcommunity  #fall #autumn #outside"

One of my main motivations for hiking the AT is due to the fact that I'm a trail builder in real life. I spent the 3 years before my 2018 thru-hike building and maintaining trails in Vermont, Arizona and Maine. I continue to chase after my dream of thru-hiking the AT because I helped maintain sections of the trail all over Maine in 2017 and I greatly desire to hike through these sections. I am still heart broken over my most recent defeat on the Applachian Trail, but my dream still lives on. I know that one day I will complete my thru-hike and keep the promise I made so many years ago. #atclassof2020 #atclassof2018 #vycc #arizonaconservationcorps #maineconservationcorps"

We asked Peaches to tell us what hiking the long trail meant to her: ""What does my AT hike mean to me?<br><br>Sheesh. The AT. What a mix of emotions. It means everything to me.<br><br>It was the moment where I decided to start living MY life & not one that “the world” had written for me.<br><br>It was where I learned that putting my needs first isn’t selfish, it’s the only way I can become the best version of myself ….which, in turn, is what benefits the world the most. (still a daily struggle though)<br><br>It was where I learned that I really don’t need much to survive. A life of simplicity is a life of joy. Keep it simple & enjoy the little things.<br><br>It was where I learned that I am CAPABLE. Of anything. Of whatever I want to do.<br><br>It was where I met the most inspiring people. Every person you meet has an incredible story and are learning the same things I've mentioned above. “They” say you are the people you surround yourself with….well I have an extended trail family of amazing people who literally kick ass at whatever they do and they encourage me & inspire me (""selfishly"" being the best version of themselves) to be the best I can be. <br>To be a bit melodramatic, the AT changed my life."" - Peaches<br><br>_____________<br><br>Thank you Peaches!

I struggled internally, fighting my mind & body each day to keep moving forward. <br>Every day.. I wanted to stop...coming close several times. The cold waited as I sat on a rock, unable to will myself any further. Doubt, failure of a life not lived came into view as the light faded.<br><br>There was no joy...The yearning for sun, familiarity, the company of others  grew until I realized no one was coming...not physically, the sun set quicker each day & the only person who'd make the decision to quit or not sat in the reflection of the creek. ~~~~~~ That hike broke me, mentally, spiritually & physically. Motivation came from thoughts of walking into town, stopping at the nearest hotel, renting a room for a month & not talking to anyone for fear of failing the community, family, friends & myself. ~~~~~~ The good is difficult to gather in times like this. Yet, I am reminded again how lucky, priviledged & special I am. It is awkward to write that...still.<br><br>I got to see the wildest places this country has. I chose a time to live with what I could carry, physically & emotionally. For nine months I saw less people than a morning communter on the NYC A Train.<br><br>Through all that, I made connections with people I am honored to call friends. I experienced the genuine good in people. In the deepest ruts, someone came through, whether a stranger or a friend from afar. <br>I lost a part of myself & found another. I remember why I'd started to traverse the country on foot..it wasn't just for me, it was for a larger community & purpose<br><br>It's about perspective, its easy to be overwhelmed in the moment...so I sit here, with gratitude for the life I've had, these past two years have been filled with valleys & peaks.<br><br>Here I am, a year later.

I hiked for 5 months from Maine to Georgia, enduring weather, eating as much food as possible, taking in breathtaking views, and making badass friends.

I'd search through different websites trying to see reviews of pros and cons of each piece of gear from different people trying to answer my vast number of questions:<br>•Is this item worth it's weight?<br>•Are there lighter options?<br>•How did this expensive piece of gear hold up to being used and abused day after day?<br>•How did people like this item that's from a small cottage company that doesn't have many reviews?<br>•How did this item fit? Was it comfortable?<br>And so on and so forth.<br>•<br>But now, there's sidebar. A website that you can find trusted reviews from people who OWN and USE the gear they're reviewing and the reviews are all in ONE PLACE. We aren't paid to try out the gear, we're just normal everyday adventurers who want to help others going through the same anxious process of gear decisions. There are even LIVE people ready to answer your gear questions. From Altras to Z-packs you can find detailed information about everything from if a tent held up in a rainstorm, how warm that sleeping bag really felt during a blizzard in the smokies, or if a stove busted on a thru hiker the first night on trail. That's why I'm so happy to be an Ambassador for this company, so I can help others spend less time worrying about gear decisions and spend more time getting on with their adventures.<br>•<br>•<br>•<br>•<br>•<br>•<br>#sidebar #sidebarambassador #nature #hiking #geardecisions #appalachiantrail #thruhiker #thruhike #bigagnes #zpacks #altrarunning #gear #backpacking #dayhiker #optoutside #at2018 #atclassof2018 #thruhike2018 #georgiatomaine2018 #thetrek #womeninthewild  #womenwhohike #optoutside #rei1440project #hikertrash #weekendwarrior  #hikeyourownhike #hikerlife @ask_sidebar"

One month into my hike last year, these two kids and their dad came along behind me seemingly out of nowhere. They took 19 days to travel what took me 33 to do. We found immediate connections beyond the trail, and hiked and laughed together for only a mile or two before they surpassed me, but they remain my favorite people I met on the trail. Despite their mileage being almost twice what mine was, I did actually cross paths with them a couple more times before they were suddenly days then weeks then months ahead of me. We reconnected around the beginning of this year and went on a day hike together. Then they trail magicked me when I got back on trail this year! My heart nearly exploded with joy, I swear. Now they've moved back to Ireland, but I have a feeling geography won't get in the way of our connection.

It was our last Saturday morning, and we were hiking by 6:45am. The goal of the day was to make it to the ranger station in Baxter early enough to reserve a spot at the Birches campsite. Space there is very limited, only for AT hikers, and we wanted to make sure the three of us made the list. We reached Abol Bridge after 3.5 miles. The view of Katahdin from there could fund a postcard business for life. The hiking on this second to last day was the easiest I encountered the entire way. I laughed thinking about how many times I had heard ppl ask ""when does it flatten out a bit?"" Here,  apparently. Here in the shadow of Katahdin. The climbs (except one) were over. The roots had all been removed for us. Someone must have come along during the night and replaced all of the rocks with soft pine needles. Penobscot River, Abol Stream, Nesowadnehunk Stream, Big and Little Niagara Falls (vid), and Katahdin Stream. This was one of the most scenic parts we had encountered at such low elevation. Most of the ground we covered this day was between 500-700ft. To reach the sign, we would need to climb a mile up from there to 5,268ft. Nobody had passed us, and we spoke to a ranger who told us only three AT hikers were ahead of us. Feeling confident that we would make the list for camping in the park, we took a long break on the rock bank above the rushing river below. Afterward, we made it to the ranger station, checked in, and claimed our camp spots. I decided to use one of the lean-tos. A couple ppl were in the other lean-to. The others put up their tents. It seemed fitting that I was spending the last night alone, just my thoughts, my sleeping bag, and me. My mind was racing as I wondered how tomorrow would go, just as it was at Hawk Mountain Shelter, 8.1 miles north of Springer Mountain, back in Georgia on night one. This time, however, nerves were replaced by confidence, apprehension by excitement. And sleep came in 15 minute increments once again as each time I opened my eyes I was hoping for the first glimpse of sunshine so we could get started. <br>#appalachiantrail #hiking #baxterstatepark #maine"

The final two days on JB's envelope guide were just 13.4 and 5.2.  @theatguide and @guthookguides often included notes about views. On this day the note next to Nesuntabunt Mountain read ""view of Katahdin, 16 mile line-of-sight"". Hoping it would be a good one, I Facetimed my parents so they could witness it with me from the top of the climb. We were talking about how the week had gone, where the rest of the group was, working on the loose ends for pickup from Baxter in a couple days, and then I saw this (pic).

But seeing THIS view of what I started hiking toward 157 days ago left ME speechless and frozen for a few seconds for sure. I snapped out of it and turned the phone to show them. BigBen and JB had arrived before I did (of course) and were sitting on rocks, facing the view. It wasn't often during a break, especially on top of a mountain, that we didn't have our phones out at least checking for a signal. They didn't have theirs out. There was nothing else to see at that moment. Mom and dad, probably sensing the gravity of the scene, quickly said ""We'll talk later. Go be with them!""

Some had vast hiking experience. Others planned for years to try this specific journey. During vacation, Christmas 2016, I was watching a YouTube video about a specific hammock that I was considering for camping trips with my niece and nephews. The next suggested video was @homemadewanderlust talking about switching from a hammock to a tent on the AT. Over the next two weeks, I watched her entire thru hike on YouTube. In January, I was sitting across from my boss, discussing my plan to hike it the following March. Everyone who needed to approve my time off was super supportive (some in their own unique ways). I followed many thru hikers during 2017 and distinctly remember one of their posts from Pemadumcook Lake (2143.2). It was shot from behind her, looking past her blonde braid and over her shoulder, at Mount Katahdin in the distance. I remember looking at my phone in complete awe of her. She was there..She did it! What was she thinking? How was she holding up emotionally? What toll had the weather taken on her? What had she witnessed during all that time out there? Who did she meet? Did she ever want to quit? What was the best part? How are her feet? What does it FEEL like to actually SEE it?? 15 miles into day 156, I stood on that exact same spot. I didn't know her name. I didn't know where she was from. I didn't even know what her face looked like. But in that moment, I thought of her, and I knew EXACTLY what she had felt, and I had all of my questions answered. Those answers are earned- and sacred in a way. And I count myself lucky to share them with every hiker who has stepped to the edge of that same lake, looked north, and for the very first time up -close, laid their eyes on their trophy. .<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #atclassof2018 #at2018 #atclassof2019 #at2019 #hiking #nature #travel #adventure #trektheat #hiketheat #thetrek #maine #lakes #mountain #katahdin #views"

She is damn near perfect. At this point I had been hiking with her for over 1,500 miles which is a long way. And day 155 (8/8) just happened to be her birthday. BigBen packed out a box of wine and had been carrying it thru the 100 Mile Wilderness to give her on this day. This picture was feet away from what could have been our first glimpse of Katahdin had the sky been clear. It was not, but we took our break anyway, and on top of that little rock was the only place she was able to get any reception to call home. We hiked on the rest of the day to make it to Crawford Pond (2128.2). Just off the trail, there were 4 or 5 flat spots under some giant pine trees. Behind the trees, there was a thin trail cut between two walls of high grass. About 20ft thru the grass, it opened up to a coastline of sand and the most calm lake, lined with pine trees on both sides and a mountain in the distance beyond the far side. It was the very definition of serenity, and there was no way we were leaving. As JB and I stood there taking it all in, I ruined the silence with, ""you wouldn't believe how hard it was to reserve this place for your birthday""🎉 Now, it was very clearly marked, ""No Camping"". And we were not ones to break the rules 😏 So we decided we would take a short eight hour BREAK here and air out our gear to make sure it was dry for the final push. So there, BigBen, Jukebox, and I spent night 155, JB's bday, at a spot more perfect than anyone could ever even draw. The night was calm, water was still, and we were just feet from our own private beach in the mountains of Maine. But we were NOT camping. Definitely not camping..bc that wasn't allowed. I was still holding out hope that Paddington was closing the gap and would catch us in the next couple days. 😎 ⛰ 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♀️🏃‍♂️⛰⛰⛰🏃‍♂️<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #atclassof2018 #at2018 #atclassof2019 #at2019 #hiking #nature #travel #adventure #trektheat #hiketheat #thetrek #maine #camping #backpacking #not #birthdaygirl #canyouhearmenow #cellphone #birthday #tramily #girlswhohike #mountains #views #getoutside"

Paddington🐻 was staying behind, in Monson, for one day. Duke🤴 was just under a week ahead of us. JB🎤, BB🔔, and I🤧 loaded into a packed shuttle and headed to the trail. The hope was that Paddington, hiking alone, would be able to pull some big days and catch the three of us somewhere in the 100 Mile Wilderness before we reached Baxter State Park.<br>.<br>. **action music plays during gear montage** We exited the SUV, tied our shoes, strapped our packs onto our backs, tightened everything down, made sure snacks were within reach so we could eat on the move, earbuds in, trekking poles adjusted and locked. It was finally GO TIME. It was time to start the final push to the final park and the ultimate climb. We were now just three-strong, but were champing at the bit to start this section of 100 miles, totally cut off from everything other than an occasional old logging (gravel) road or former stagecoach trail. So off we went, confident and ready💪🏃‍♂️🏃‍♀️🏃‍♂️ Just down a small hill from the side of ME Rt15, I heard Big Ben, ""Ah come on!""🙅‍♂️ **brakes screech to a halt**🚷 In front of us was a river JUST big enough that we couldn't jump it. It would take about 4 or 5 big steps in water up to our shins in order to cross. We only discussed the dilemma for a minute. It didn't make sense to start the day with soaked socks and shoes, so we undid everything, changed into our camp shoes (Crocs, recover slides), crossed the small river, and put everything back on, on the other side. It only added a few minutes, but it was a little annoying nonetheless. While sitting down and lacing our shoes back up, JB and BB let out a laugh when I pointed out, ""Man, the 100 Mile Wilderness is no joke!"" It was perfectly ridiculous because we could still hear the occasional car zipping by on ME Rt15, less than 50 yards away. After that minor minor set back, we did get moving and started covering some ground, totally isolated from society, and it was as perfect as I had hoped it would be.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #atclassof2018 #at2018 #at2019 #hiking #nature #travel #adventure #trektheat #hiketheat #maine #wilderness #backpacking"

We were still right on schedule according to JB's plan. Thankfully it didn't align  with @dylan_duke_sharp current plan as he informed us via group text that a few trail days ahead of us, he just completed a 40+ mile day ☠ Thank Baby Jesus, that wasn't scribbled on our envelope. The water crossings were increasing at about the same rate that the number of bridges was decreasing. This one had a handy rope to use for balance. Unfortunately, anyone who used it ultimately learned of the hornets' nest hanging on the tree just above the rope on the far side. We made it to Monson and to Shaw's and met up with many of our friends, including YouTube celebr-AT, @amanda_the_bess .

I hiked 9.6 miles on the Laurel Highlands Hiking Trail which provided me with views of the mountains, some mushrooms, and some bajillion legged bug friends, along with some much needed time in the woods. I can always tell when I need to take a break from day to day life and get out onto a trail for the day. There's something about hiking, being in nature, and surrounded by mountains that grounds me. It's hard to stress about things when I'm focusing on my feet, or enjoying a breathtaking view, or experimenting with taking photos of random mushrooms. It also keeps me offline, which I feel all humans could benefit from offline time. Overall, this trail was challenging yet rewarding. The entire thing is 70 miles boasting some of the most beautiful scenery in Pennsylvania. I hope to be back in September with Skywater to do an overnight or two for our Katahdinversary."

If the guy had left for the day, we would have to choose between wasting the day waiting til the next morning or trying to ford it on our own. We heard that a hiker had already drowned earlier in the year trying to make it across. So, we reserved the option just in case, but we made it in time. After signing a waiver, the guide took hikers across in groups of two. The round trip took about 15 minutes for him to get back for the next pair. This was the only section of trail that we didn't have to walk. The canoe is an official part of the trail and  even has a white blaze painted on the floor(?) After we all crossed, we checked into the Caratunk House B&B. They perfected the on demand hiker meal. They did one thing and did it WELL.

Maine kept hitting us. Rain, mud, and more falls. We would often reach these ""bridges"" and just drop our heads and laugh. It was easy to be discouraged. But what was more useful was to appreciate the fact that at one point, a team of volunteers hiked to the very same spot, probably on their weekend off. They lugged tools, supplies, likely lunch and dinner for a long day. They measured, cut, fitted, and installed something to help hikers navigate a tricky spot. They weren't present to see their talents pay off, and what they built had fallen into disrepair over the years, but for a chunk of time, they had created something pristine, the importance of which probably went mostly unnoticed or taken for granted, as thousands of hikers quickly crossed over some would-be tough terrain. In this case, we weren't so lucky, but there were hundreds of foot bridges, and fallen trees with a hiker-size gaps removed, and strategically placed rocks to use when the rest of the trail was submerged, and fire rings, and shelters (but not Groundhog Creek- day 28), and privys, and the list goes on. Each day there was a reminder that my hike was only possible because of those who put the work in before I arrived. .<br>.<br>Jukebox had mapped out our days from this day until Katahdin. It was shocking to see the date, camp spot, and miles for each day laid out on the back of an otherwise meaningless envelope. There was now an official date with ""Mt. Katahdin"" next to it.

""We keep our hiker mail behind the counter and our dog (who had free run of the shop) must have smelled it and tried to get into it. The inside bag (Ziplock) wasn't harmed, but if you don't want it, I understand, and you can pick out ANY of the beef jerky we sell and you can have it, with our apologies."" Well, thank you, but 1. a friend I've had for almost 30 years made that for me, and 2. considering that your dog passed up all of those and went for mine, I'm happy to do the same. I think she was relieved that I wasn't upset about it and gave me a few extra treats before I headed over to the Leki expert. She was really sweet about the whole thing and pointed out what a great friend Drew must be. She was right. .<br>.<br>So, to the far side of the shop I walked and proudly presented my Leki Cristallo poles. ""What the hell..?"" Yeah, so, this middle section *I pointed to the faded gray duct tape* broke on both poles and I had to figure out a way to keep them together.

Well it took about a week, but look who Paddington and I found! Paddington, BigBen, Jukebox, and I were reunited 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 after they had hiked on after finishing the Whites, when P and I cut the day short to avoid the storm and hang out with Baseweight🏡 While we were still incomplete without Duke, it was nice to be with these two again. 👉It's funny how the mood changes with different personalities back together after a short break. The trail taught me a lot about not taking things for granted👈 This day was another damp and foggy one, but when we reached @hikerhutat2pine the clouds were gone and the sun began to set. This place was as unique as advertised. Little cell service, no electricity, dinner prepared in the corner cabin/kitchen, an open outdoor shower (secluded enough) fed by the river, and resident chipmunks. While we picked thru loaner clothes and our laundry was gathered for a town run to the laundromat by the owner, we took turns feeding Chippy. He would fill his cheeks, disappear behind one of the small cabins, then scurry back for a refill, and repeat. We met a solo SOBO, too willing to offer us misguided advice, 220 miles into his hike (1,970 miles into ours). By this point we had mastered the smile and nod. Before bed, HipCat and Gypsy arrived- two more of our really good friends. HipCat and I obliterated a POT of spaghetti, and the co-owner gladly refilled it. By this point, we were no different than Chippy🐿🍝 Before the night was over, we made a fire, I beat Paddington in a hula hoop competition (not even close), and secured my next town milkshake. Before leaving the next day, we would head into Rangley, ME, 9 miles away, where I had mail waiting, in addition to a life lesson in leverage. 🎓😁 #appalachiantrail #atclassof2018 #at2018 #atclassof2019 #at2019 #hiking #nature #travel #adventure #trektheat #hiketheat #thetrek #maine #wildlife #chipmunk #backpacking #camping #tramily #tanlines"

At dinner on night 142 @rampaigingaround 🐐 used her.. rampaiginess 🤷‍♂️ to convince the brew pub to pick us up the following morning in their brew bus and shuttle us back to the trail- the same shuttle she got them to pick us up in earlier in the evening. I said it before, get yourself a Rampaige. Life is better with a Rampaige. At the parking lot in the morning, our group of about 15 strong (tip of the cap to Stylo, Slider, Irish, BeachBum, and the entire Northbound Horde) seemed to linger. Maine had been tough. Like, really tough, and this was only day 3. The previous week was marked by rain, mud, hard falls, and just an air of low morale. I think a lot of us fell into the trap of thinking that reaching Maine would change something. There were still 250 miles to go and so much work to be done. The reason nobody wanted to start on this day was the 2,300ft climb right from the jump. But as always in the north, the climb ended with a reward. This view made it feel like I was in another world. Sometimes I just had to laugh when I summited something, only to find out that I hadn't (pic) and that I was just half way there. Encountering that kind of slap in the face forces someone to reevaluate what they're really capable of, and when you reach the top of the next climb, false summit or otherwise, that answer becomes a little more clear every single time. <br>#appalachiantrail #atclassof2018 #at2018 #atclassof2019 #at2019 #hiking #nature #travel #adventure #trektheat #hiketheat #thetrek #maine #mountains #scenic #optoutside #gooutside #mountainclimbing #backpacking"

The previous day ended with Mahoosuc Notch, the most difficult mile of the trail- jumping from one boulder to another over 20+ ft drops, taking your pack off and shoving it ahead because the holes you crawl thru aren't big enough for hiker AND pack, spots where you have to grab trunks or branches and hope they won't snap sending you plummeting down a crevice to ground still covered in snow...in late July🧣🧤 The best part was, WE were doing this in an intense thunderstorm. Once we finally made it thru, we looked up at the 1800ft climb on a trail that had become an actual waterfall. We looked at each other🤔 nope! We elected to stealth camp for the night and tackle that beast in the morning. We were exhausted and soaked, just totally spent. We did make the climb in the morning and found an overflowing Speck Pond on the other side of the mountain. Witness Paddington taking a ""freedom step"" (video) over what was usually dry rocks before we turned right and began our hike IN the river en route to Grafton Notch(1923.7) where we would catch a ride to @rampaigingaround 's relatives mountain home. The generous offer to stay there was so needed and came at the PERFECT time. While waiting at the trailhead, I also met @cromeworld (Trey) who had just done a giant resupply. I asked why so much food? He said it was his last planned resupply. Whaaat??! Over 250 miles left?? He told me his goal was to finish in 99 days, so he was making a push to get there. I asked why 99 days? ""Bc everyone shoots for 100. I want to beat that."" And guess what. He DID IT! Crazy things happening in the trees that you can't see from afar, and some really incredible ppl doing them. Trey continued to do some really amazing things since finishing the trail, including using adventure to raise some big money for some great causes!👍🏻He posts some jaw dropping shots of those adventures.

Hey, remember how after Paddington slipped or dunked one shoe in the water/mud (a misstep he referred to as the day's ""freedom step"") he would stop trying to avoid mud and water for the rest of the day? Remember how he would admonish us for trying to take the slower, slightly less wet route? Weeeellllllll sometimes, SOMETIMES the random 2x8 boards floating atop the mud end just before the deep stuff. Having just finished Mt. Success- yes the real name of the last mountain in NH, we were crossing an..alpine bog? The rain has been well documented. The ""bridges"" were less than helpful, usually looking like a game of Pick Up Sticks. On this day, Paddington, having slipped from a rock earlier, was taking the short line thru whatever was in the middle of the trail. I was about 10ft behind him as he took that fateful step off the last board and 💨*poof*💨his legs disappeared! 😂 He looked like Lt. Dan, knee deep in 2ft of mud, unable to lift his legs out. I did what any good thru hiking buddy would have done: stepped to the right, to the high ground, grabbed my phone from my pocket, and started recording🤳 Watching this now, I laugh just as hard as I did when it happened. I regret nothing. And you're all welcome for capturing it.

We parted ways with BW after a quick Walmart run. Paddington and I were now a day behind JB and BB, probably three days behind Duke, and about to start our last full day in NH. Despite the previous rain, MOVING water was difficult to find. At one point while hiking alone, I was just about out of water and hadn't encountered any streams for more than a few miles. I stopped at a beaver dam and checked my guide book. There wasn't any water coming up either. While trying to talk myself into drinking from the trickle exiting the baracade of meticulously placed branches, Thunder arrived. She was in the same predicament. Low on water, hot, and no relief in site. We vowed to take this plunge together. We gathered, filtered, and drank. I added Aqua Mira drops and fruit punch powder for good measure. It tasted...ok. Not anything like the water we gathered from a shallow mud puddle in PA that tasted like a Christmas candle smells🕯🌲 At the very next opportunity I dumped the remaining beaver water and filtered new moving water to fill my 1.75L. I had replaced my shoes for the last time, and  was equal parts excited and nervous for ""the most difficult mile"" of the trail which would come at some point during the next day. .<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #atclassof2018 #at2018 #atclassof2019 #at2019 #hiking #nature #travel #adventure #trektheat #hiketheat #thetrek #newhampshire #whitemountains #altra #beaver"

The Imp Shelter was packed the previous night. In the morning, wet gear was all over the place. We packed up relatively quietly, trying to not wake anyone else. Upon leaving the shelter, the steep climb up Mt. Moriah started, the last mountain in the Whites. Near the top, it hit me out of nowhere: my socks!🧦 My brand new Injinjis and DT! I left them hanging on the wall of the shelter two miles back😢 There was no cell service at the shelter, so none of my calls to hikers behind us went thru. I was NOT turning around and hiking back INTO the Whites. But I was also down to just one pair now. When we made it down to Rattle River Hostel, we found Rambo. He had just met up with a friend of his who thoughtfully brought him new DT socks. This won't make sense to any non-hiker, but he did the nicest thing ever and GAVE me a pair of his used hiking socks. I was back! Two pair😄 There was a break in the rain, and JB and BB hiked on while P and I secured a ride to Baseweight's house. Unsure if we would catch them again, we said our goodbyes, hoping for the best. The next round of thunderstorms rolled in shortly after, and it was clear we made the right choice. At BW's I quickly realized that she was THE coolest trail angel I met between GA and ME😇🙌🏼 She was super generous, easy going, thoughtful, and kind. She grilled us dinner, introduced her great pup (not the video- that's her roommate's), and offered us down detergent to clean our gear. We all stayed up talking, a little later than usual, but the only regret I had was hiking out the next day and not taking her invite to zero.🤦🏼‍♂️<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #atclassof2018 #at2018 #atclassof2019 #at2019 #hiking #nature #travel #adventure #trektheat #hiketheat #thetrek #newhampshire #whitemountains #dogsofinstagram #dawes"

What the hell are the Wildcats?! And seven out. If the weather was a game of craps, on this day, we rolled a seven. This is one of just two pics I took that day. I thought the lily pads and grass ""just beneath the surface""🎤 looked really cool. We woke up and sprrriiinnted out of that motel in Gorham, but the day was marred by rain and fog, so my phone stayed tucked away. Having never hiked in the NORTH, north, I only knew what I was told. And that was the Presidentials, specifically Mt. Washington. Having completed that part, finding out there was another range in the Whites took me by surprise. The Wildcats (which were disappointingly named ""A"" thru ""E"" and NOT after different Wildcats like Mt. Puma and Lynx) were on tap this day. Paddington would always get annoyed with us in the rain. WE would all try to avoid ankle deep water by lunging from rock to log to mud. HE would just drive on right thru the middle saying we were wasting time. ""You're wet anyway! Commit!"" While we slowed to use a fallen branch as a balance beam, he would stomp right thru the middle, then turn, laugh at us, and keep going. Despite my best efforts, by the end of the day, everything was soaked. At Imp Shelter (1884.6) I hung my Injinjis and Darn Toughs (both pair, brand new) on the log wall to try to dry over night. We knew more rain was coming. Over dinner, Paddington said he didn't want to do this anymore ✋🏼UH..WHAT?? ""This"" meant struggle. There was no reason to limp to the finish. Why not try to do the rest as comfortably as possible? Neither of us had a major time constraint. When the weather was bad, let's head to town. Slow the pace. Enjoy it. I was on the fence. But we did decide to stay in Gorham/Berlin the following day. Having talked Paddington's ear off most of the day about our new NH friend, Baseweight☺🤷‍♂️, texting her was the logical choice.

This is one of my favorites.<br>.<br>.<br> More perfect weather to climb Mt. Washington just before 7am. At the top, we would eat and meet JB's Uncle Sam who took the long drive up to grab our packs so we could sail the rest of the day. With Jefferson and Madison (my favorite) still left, not carrying our entire packs went a long way in making the day such a great one. On the way down Mt. Washington, we saw the passenger train full of people waving excitedly as they witnessed AT hikers in their natural environment, the auto road snaking its way up the climb in bumper to bumper fashion, and these motorcycles parked at a lookout (pic). Given all the different ways one could ascend Mt. Washington, it would take a pretty compelling arguement to convince me that our way wasn't the best one. The way we planned it, this day turned out to be really enjoyable rather than the torturous ordeal we were warned about. If I had a crystal ball, I would have happily anticipated this day instead of cautiously dreading it for the week leading up to it. We ended the day after 7pm in Gorham, NH where JB's aunt and uncle treated us to dinner. Our waitress spotted us as hikers and demanded our table. We chatted about our journey and hers, she having hiked it previously. By the end of the meal she slipped JB her phone number and mentioned that select NOBOs, if they are so lucky, get to crash at her place for a night while passing thru the area. Unfortunately, on this night, we already had a reservation at a place that probably gets worse Yelp reviews than the Overlook Hotel in The Shining. We laid down, hoping that there weren't any used syringes under our bunks, and prayed the morning would get here soon so we could leave. .<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #atclassof2018 #at2018 #atclassof2019 #at2019 #hiking #nature #travel #adventure #trektheat #hiketheat #thetrek #newhampshire #theshining #yelp #motorcycle<br>#motorcyles #motorcyclesofinstagram #whitemountains #mountwashington #heresjohnny #baseweight #hikeryearbook"

Other than the mini golf day, we really lucked out with weather in the Whites. This was day 1 of being a group of 4, not 5. Duke would now act as my private scout, sending me intel from the trail and letting me know what to expect, since he would stay a few days ahead of us the rest of the way. It was clear and cool at times, and the new weather-related concern was sunburn. We spent a lot of time above the trees as we checked off Little Haystack, Mt. Lafayette, Garfield, South Twin Mountain, Guyot, Webster, Jackson, Pierce, Franklin, and Monroe. Remember, names = challenging sections. The Whites are beasts. But they were among my favorite sections of the whole thing. We stopped at Lake of the Clouds Hut where we met up with so many of our friends from the past weeks. Many of the ppl we knew planned to stop there, just 1.5 miles shy of Mt. Washington (pic, about 11 o'clock, highest peak in frame), and those who planned on hiking on, we convinced to stay anyway. The room beneath the hut, aptly named ""The Dungeon"", was full, so we were permitted to sleep on the floor of the main common room where the city slickers ate. We just had to work for a half hour picking up trash around the hut. Not seeing much litter, I spent 5 minutes approaching arriving and resting hikers asking for the trash from their packs, and my bag was filled in record time. #worksmarter Paddington, BB, and I deemed it wise to swim in the lake that give the hut its name. Who knew the water at the base of Mt. Washington, a mile in the air, would be almost freeeezziing? 🌨❄ The pool party didn't last long, and we changed, put on our puffy coats, and joined the rest of the gang, about 20 of us, on the platform to watch the sunset. Another day closer, and about 10 hours from one of the most hyped and iconic spots on the AT. When we turned in, there were about 50 hikers strewn on the floor, and there was no time to dream about tomorrow, since there was another bathroom door, intent on keeping every single person awake alllll niiigghht loooonnnng.<br><br>#appalachiantrail #mtwashington #mountains #hiking #atclassof2018 #at2018"

Duke and I woke up on the wooden floor of Galehead Hut. We headed out just after 7am to begin our last day hiking together. Throughout the day, he pulled ahead, and I caught up to him, Rambo, and Professor at Zealand Falls Hut. The falls were just beyond the hut and we found it to be a perfect place for lunch. The water runs down a smooth, orange rock formation where we were able to sit with our feet in the cold water, eating on a waterfall in possibly the most stereotypical setting for an outdoorsy lunch of all time. Unfortunately, this was the last time I would see Duke on the AT, bc he was about to forge ahead to finish sooner than our group was planning.<br>🏃‍♂️ ⛰⛰⛰⛰🚶‍♂️🚶‍♀️🚶‍♂️🚶‍♂️<br>.<br>A hard deadline had materialized on his end.

Replace the trees on the right with a drop off of unknown distance, and that's what it was like. The trail/rock was a similar angle, but slippery as the rain had just started. Today was different in that I managed to remain upright and enjoyed the views from my feet. The Whites were spectacular in every way, but they couldn't replace the missing piece in our group as our Duke hiked on ahead of us... #appalachiantrail #atclassof2018 #at2018 #atclassof2019 #at2019 #hiking #nature #travel #adventure #trektheat #hiketheat #thetrek #newhampshire #whitemountains #camping #views #mountains"

The weather had passed and we needed a ride back to the trail. The ONLY option we could find was the Shuttle Connection. We called to secure a ride. ""Great. It'll be $20."" Ok, do you have room for five, plus pack? ""Yes. $20 each. $100 total."" What? No. You didn't understand. We are all going from the same motel to the same trail head. One ride. ""Yeah. $20 per person."" We had no other choice and it sucked. 👉🏽DO NOT USE THE SHUTTLE CONNECTION🙅‍♂️ He is anti-hiker and exploits the lack of competition. The reason I loved my ppl so much was that we actually contemplated calling back to back to back to back to back and each taking our own $20 ride. Make him earn it. 🤷‍♂️ The only downfall was that the driver would almost definitely stop picking us up at a certain point and the ones at the end of the line would be screwed. I hiked the majority of the day with Duke, and it was a great day. The views from Franconia Ridge were unlike anything I had seen during the hike so far. Being above the trees and on the ridgeline meant that, once again, we could see the next few hours laid out right in front of us. The hiking was difficult but REALLY fun at the same time. Duke would wait for me to catch up on each peak so we stayed relatively close and had time to talk a lot that day. The two of us ended at Galehead Hut where we were allowed to do a work-for-stay. While city folk drove to the bottom of the mountain and hiked up 5 miles and paid over $100/night to feel like they were camping, we got to sleep on the floor of the cabin's dining room after Duke washed dishes and I cleaned the stove top burners. After the nature seekers finally had lights-out at 10pm, we set our sleeping bags up under the long wooden tables to catch some sleep before their breakfast wakeup call that would come soon- a hut caretaker playing ukelele and singing a camp song.

The forecast for day 133 was NOT good. Being a mile up in the Whites made it down right dangerous. Having hiked until after dark last night, I was not mad when it was suggested that we zero, stay down in town, and head out the next day. We relocated from Chet's to the Holiday Inn in Lincoln. I knew the odds of zeroing again after this were low- at least I hoped so. Not wanting to waste this one, I talked Duke into putting on our rain gear and heading out to play some miniature golf. I felt bad for the two kids working, because I'm pretty sure had we not shown up just before the rain started, they could have closed up shop and headed back to their Xstations or Playboxes. As it so happened, just after teeing off, the storm moved from the mountain (pic) down to the course, totally eliminating skill from playing a role in the result of our round. For that reason, the final score isn't even worth mentioning.

Our plan was to drive north and hike back to Hikers Welcome Hostle. We had been warned about the Whites, and this was the first day we would be in them, above the trees. We hiked up and over Mount Moosilauke, 4,802ft. Once we reached the top, it was 3,759ft back down the mountain. We reached the hostel, and Paddington took a shuttle into town to get our dinner at a deli. It took 1,800 miles, but this was the day we met @seebagsgo ! We immediately wished we had met her earlier- hilarious, quick, and a Pittsburgh connection. We sat around a fire with a couple NOBO section hikers discussing the stories we had heard about the Whites, wondering if it could possibly live up to the hype.

It broke my heart to drive BACK across the bridge into VT, and I was skeptical of these outsiders for making us do such a heinous thing. But THEN we got to the house. They organized EVERYTHING for us. The house itself, transportation, drinks, food..everything. After hiking for so long, this day was a perfect day to just have to show up. James, Liv, Megan, and Maddy could not have been more friendly. It felt like I had gone to @batescollege with them and like I had known them for years. They immediately got started on a taco dinner, served us drinks, gave us the choice of bedrooms, and surrendered the bathrooms for hiker showers. We exchanged trail stories for college stories and laughed so hard it was tough to breathe.

It's an entire page of folks willing to house, shuttle, and help hikers as they cross the bridge into NH. Encountering trail magic in any form was so great, but the work, time, dedication, and generosity involved in organizing a pool like this blew my mind. We made it halfway down the list before we we able to coordinate a stay with Fran, a retired physician with a really comfortable townhouse. Before we reached her, our pace siiiignificantly slowwwed as we crossed the Dartmouth campus during the women's soccer team's scrimmage. Showers, laundry, and an uber into town for dinner with the group and JB's friend, Sam, was a great way to end the day.

When Paddington and I checked into the motel in Killington the night before, the receptionist told us that Pappy was also a guest there for the night. Pappy was known to everyone hiking last year, as he was out there trying to become the oldest person to ever thru-hike the AT. He had already hiked the PCT, CDT, and AT. This time, at 87 years old, he was trying to do it again and earn the title as the oldest to ever finish it.  We got in late and nobody was outside at the pool and firepit area, so we assumed like most other sane (relatively speaking) hikers, he was already in bed. After a meal at a small deli, second dinner from a pizza place, and a good night's sleep, we headed back out in the morning. The following day, we actually DID get to meet Pappy. He was hiking south for the day with his granddaughter and at least a couple great grandkids. He talked to me for a couple minutes, and I congratulated him on how far he had hiked so far. He was humble as could be, soft spoken, and extremely friendly. The patience he must have had to put up with probably 1,000 versions of me and interactions like this is impossible for me to wrap my head around. Hiking the AT is tough enough, I couldn't imagine what it would have been like if everyone I met wanted to interview me and snap a picture (which I did📸 🤦🏼‍♂️) .<br>.<br>We also came to a steep rock wall with this ladder literally tied to the face. There was no other option but to trust it and scale the 20ish feet straight up. The rest of the day consumed me with two questions, 1. What did ppl do before this ladder got here, and 2.

We reached a sign telling us that we had ""just"" 500 miles left to go! <br>It took 50 days to hike the first 500 miles.<br>From that point to this picture, I covered 1,190.9 more miles. It took 74 days to cover that gap. 👉🏽First 500 miles = 10 miles/day average<br>👉🏽Next 1,190.9 miles = 16.1 miles/day<br>And that's what trail legs are all about, Charlie Brown. 🛑✋🏼It's amazing, the changes the trail brings about in those who hike it.🚦👍🏻<br>.<br>.<br>On this day, we also crossed over Killington Peak near Rutland, VT, home of the Yellow Deli. Their story is a long and troubled one, one involving alleged cult activity and questionable behavior. We didn't stop there, but I know plenty of hikers who did. They ALL had a positive experience. They feed hikers and offer them bunks on a donation-based system. All they ask is that you be respectful and either listen to or join in a prayer before meals. The only serious warning is to NOT accept their invitation to the farm. That's when the brainwashing may or may not begin.<br>.<br>.<br>By mile 1,700, the trail has undoubtedly changed each hiker for the better, so making good choices shouldn't be that difficult. Nobody I knew had any issues, and they enjoyed their stays at the Yellow Deli and the town of Rutland in general. But as the sign says, there were 500 miles between here and Katahdin, and the miles weren't going to hike themselves, so we were moving on. <br>#appalachiantrail #atclassof2018 #at2018 #atclassof2019 #at2019 #hiking #nature #travel #adventure #trektheat #hiketheat #thetrek #vermont #yellowdeli"

The two straightforward ways to hike the AT, or any long trail, are north (NOBO) or south (SOBO). There are reasons to choose either option on the AT. A NOBO hike starts much earlier in the year. Hostels and hiker related businesses open based on the NOBO calendar. NOBO hikers are surrounded by more people. Something like 80-90% of hikers go NOBO. SOBO is better for those looking for less congestion and more solitude and those who are logistically unable to start til later in the year. There is a friendly disdain between the groups. Mostly because SOBOs are crazy. 🤣 .<br>.<br>One of our first encounters with the other kind set the bar fairly high. Paddington was in front of me. I heard ""SOBO. Comin' in hot."" I looked up to see a long haired, bearded, caveman, wearing only a pair of shorts, shoes, and a pack and wielding a giant Gandalf branch for a walking stick. Because of his intense pace, we stepped off to the side so he could pass without breaking stride. Instead, when he reached us, he stopped and faced us, intent on more than a ""hey there"" type of exchange. ""How are you guys?!"" he demanded. ""Good. How's it goin'?"" Paddington asked. ""Oh great! Everything is AMAZING! Where ya headed??"" ""Away"" I said under my breath. Paddington talked over me to hide my attitude and be friendly as always. After pleasantries and then some, I said ""alright, take it easy"" and began to walk between Paddington and the Gray. He roughly begged, ""Dontcha wanna know my name??"" ""UhH nOt rEaLly/What's your name, friend?"" Paddington and I said in unison. .<br>.<br>""'Snake Lord'. Yesterday I felt something hit my boot. Just then, I looked down and saw a rattle snake recoiling. I took out my knife, killed it, and took it to camp and ate it. The way I see it, anything that attacks me MUST be removed from the gene pool."" After an uncomfortable laugh 😒 We wished him well and parted ways.

Manchester Center, VT is perhaps the most Vermontiest Vermont town on the trail (pic). The few people who dared look our way were friendly enough, but the air in that town had a very distinct bourgeoisie feel. From the Kate Spade shop to the designer outlets to the infused wheatgrass juice bar, hiker friendly, this town was not. People intentionally stepped toward the streetside of the sidewalk as we passed each other, presumably believing the risk of being clipped by a passenger side mirror was more desirable than the slight chance of a graze from a hiker's elbow. Oddly, if one made it to the far end of town, there was a small outdoor gear shop. We stopped there for a minute, then headed back to where we were comfortable - the laundromat. Yes, we were in town three days ago. Yes, Williamstown was only 58.5 miles behind us. And yes, we were about to do our laundry again anyway...because in Manchester Center, one must look presentable. We ran into Seven and Double Tap there. Seven always joked that the best part about hiking with his wife was ""a pretty girl's ability to attract trail magic"". Instead of doing laundry there, they were waiting for the local they met to come pick them up to take them to her home for dinner before being dropped back off at the trail later that day. As we hiked out, Paddington and I made another patented milkshake bet. I said there was NO WAY the local lady was going to let Double Tap (and Seven by extension) hike out that night. They would DEFINITELY be staying the night at her place. We would have to wait a couple days til we saw them again to find out who won the bet. But if you're wondering, I got Cookies and Cream. 🤣🏆 #appalachiantrail #atclassof2018 #at2018 #atclassof2019 #at2019 #hiking #nature #travel #adventure #trektheat #hiketheat #thetrek #vermont"

Anna1 had the pup's tent set up outside the shelter. We convinced her to bring it into the shelter with us. She was hesitant because she thought it would make other hikers uncomfortable. We said we AARRREE the other hikers! Bring us the dog! So puppy and tent joined us under the roof. Anna2 had a busted trekking pole that we tried ferociously to fix but couldn't do it. We never saw Anna and Anna after that night, and I have since wondered if they made it all the way and how the puppy did.

Paddington and I discussed camping atop the lookout tower on Glastenbury Mountain, but ultimately, it was too early in the day to stop. We hiked on another 4 miles, bringing the total for the day to 19. We camped at Kid Gore Shelter which looked out over a vast forest/valley of trees. Unfortunately, no towns or villages were included in the view, and we ended up not seeing any fireworks. Fortunately, JB had packed out glowsticks (pic) so we used them to have our own shelter party as the sun set. We camped with Seven, Double Tap, and Gravity - Seven and Double Tap were a married couple of travelling nurses based in Wisconsin, and Gravity was hilarious and a fellow  grandmaster-punsmith. To say this was an incredibly fun group would be an understatement. Seven talked about his rugby background and taught us about a pregame ritual ""Haka"" (check it out on youtube). During dinner and into the late evening, the gang shared the whiskey Seven had packed out.

When the question is asked ""what was your favorite part?"", the answer is never short, and it always includes the Long Trail in Vermont. On July 3, we entered VT and reached a sign signaling the start of the Long Trail, the first 105 miles of which are on the AT. We reached it at a perfect time. Summer had begun, the 4th of July was tomorrow, and plenty of people were about to start it. What I liked most about the a Long Trail was the new crowd of hikers that arrived. I was four months in. That's a long time to be trekking all day, er'rday. It was so rejuvenating to meet a bunch of fresh, new, happy, clean, enthusiastic hikers about to start their journey. We didn't see the same Long Trail hikers on back to back days, bc the amount of miles our two groups covered differed, and they were just starting their hikes and we were seasoned pros 😏 In addition to the mud, the knock on VT was the  lack of views early on. There were plenty of tough climbs with the payoff being views of tree trunks, 10 ft in front of you. I feel that what I saw between the PUDs more than made up for it. Scenes like this (pic) became the norm.

BB left camp before sunrise, and Paddington and I left about an hour after he did. Duke had hiked on last night, and JB and Kate had ended yesterday four miles north of us at Bascom Lodge. We were all over the place. I awoke Paddington with Happy Birthday blasting on my phone. Fortunately, the two other people camping were ok with it. At the Lodge, we sat down for a great breakfast, magically provided by JB's family. We heard some stories from when Jukebox was young, and we had the honor of seeing the infamous NASCAR shirt/sleepwear that she has had for way too long and makes her mother cringe and her sister roll her eyes. It was held together by just a few brave threads and looked worse than most of the gear that was still around, 1,600 miles in. We hiked out after breakfast and made it to Williamstown, MA where JB's parents met us one last time with much needed drinks. The temperature was pushing 105°, and we were drenched in sweat. We got yelled at by a local for sitting in a no parking area which lead to a ""whose way are we in?/you have a dog and there's a 'no pets' sign"" debate. We met my (Boston) Aunt Mo and her friend Laura at an inn that again, was far too nice for the likes of us. They brought steak and chicken, cookies and drinks. After eating and showering, we headed into town to celebrate Paddington's bday. He had requested sushi, and P and Duke ordered (literally) boatfuls of raw fish. I think those orders served on a wooden ship are normally for a table to split. We had TWO of them, and they were NOT to be shared. After dinner, I headed back with my aunt to visit and talk about the hike to this point, and the others went to the bar across the street where the bartender may or may not have confused the bday boy for a special needs adult.

Massachusetts had a fair amount of trail that crossed thru farmlands. It was nothing like southern PA, but there was some amazing, calm, open landscape to take in nonetheless. At this farm (pic), I heard JB call out, about as excited as I had ever heard her, ""Hack! PONIES!"" For me, now at mile 1,575, it was a sweet ending to the struggle I had lived for the last 1,000 miles since having not seen a single wild pony in Grayson Highlands State Park in VA. Once I caught up to JB where she was waiting, it was going be a fitting bookend to this pony saga. It meant even more to me that she remembered how excited I had been leading up to GHSP and how equally heartbroken I was all those miles ago when I was the only one who didn't get to share in that experience. I reached her, with her big smile and looked in the direction she was pointing. About 100 yards away, a field full..of...sheep? SHEEP??! ""Ponies"" she said, laughing. And yet again, tramily had become family. That was a very Kemmery thing to do. My wild pony count remained at 0, and we hiked on. We made good time, since JB's family was back and was slack packing us for the 17 miles today. When we reached Cheshire, MA, JB's friends had driven out to surprise her with sandwiches, drinks, snacks, and fruit. After we ate there, the town was having an event, earning its distinction as an official trail town. Speakers, drinks, bbq..so we ate again. During the break, Paddington pulled ANOTHER tick off of him. This time, he thought he saw a red bullseye and choosing to play it safe got an Uber to the next town for a walk in clinic. He was given an antibiotic and rejoined us later that night. He is a total tick magnet. The boys made it to a shelter while JB and her sister Kate hiked another 4 miles up Mt. Greylock to join their parents. We went to sleep stuffed, ready for another early wake up call in the morning. <br>#appalachiantrail #atclassof2018 #at2018 #atclassof2019 #at2019 #hiketheat #trektheat #thetrek #nature #massachusetts  #hiking #farms #sheep #ponies #camping #adventure #tramily"

When we looked ahead at campsites and shelters, we accepted 0.1 and 0.2 mile side trails to end the day. We came to realize that ""0.3"" was the same as ""we aren't sure how far it is either"". 0.3 could mean the shelter was 5 minutes off trail or 30 minutes off trail. Anything over 0.2 was a gamble.  We decided to go to Upper Goose Pond Cabin on this day in spite of the 0.5W designation in AWOL. The forecast was terrible, and this place was enclosed with bunks, but most importantly, the caretakers made pancakes every morning. It rained most of the day, but it stopped when we reached the side trail to the cabin. The side trail seemed to take forever because for the entire way, Upper Goose Pond stretched out to our left making it appear as tho we weren't making any progress. The worst part of these end-of-the-day side trails was that we knew we had to start the next day backtracking these steps that didn't count or get us any closer to Maine. When we did arrive however, it was a welcomed surprise to find @mikbeejay there, having returned from a leg injury 🤗 A guy near Paddington's bunk made tons of noise during the night, waking everyone in the corner multiple times. Paddington said as he packed up early the next morning, he had difficulty controlling where his head lamp was shining. It may or may not have shined on the loud stranger's face over and over again, making it as difficult for him to sleep this morning as he made it for the rest of them last night. 🤷‍♂️ #appalachiantrail #atclassof2018 #at2018 #atclassof2019 #at2019 #hiking #adventure #nature #camping #hiketheat #trektheat #thetrek #chucklovesatc #pancakes #goose"

Either yesterday or the day before, some of the others saw a porcupine. It ran across the trail and scurried up a tree. As with the ponies, I didn't get to see it. Fortunately, this day was finally a different story. I walked up on this little guy who was a little startled but didn't run. He just looked over his shoulder at me, turned north, and started walking. It was the first porcupine that I had ever seen outside of a zoo. I was surprised by how big he was. I was also a little shocked at how clumsy and awkward he appeared at first. I followed him for a little bit until he turned off trail and disappeared into some bushes. I saw where he walked in, but when I passed I could not spot him. I wondered again, as I often did: despite seeing so many cool things, how many things sneak off trail as they hear me approach, never to be seen as I walk right by? I loved these new encounters, but I wonder how many bears or snakes or birds or gnomes I walked by without even noticing. <br>#appalachiantrail #atclassof2018 #at2018 #atclassof2019 #at2019 #hiking #nature #travel #adventure #trektheat #hiketheat #thetrek #porcupine #wildlife #chucklovesatc #optinside #camping #trail #animals #benice"

This was one of those weird days when we didn't have a definitive plan. All we really knew was that before the end of the day, we would meet up with JB's uncle as he stuck around to slack pack us. Once we left our swanky accommodations, the first five miles had a few ups and downs with some nice views. That was followed by five miles of perfect, flat, soft trail. We stopped to break at one of a CT's great campsites that included a pavilion, bathroom, and water pump. They were such a nice change from the shelters we were used to. We decided that 15.9 miles into the day, we would go into town for a big lunch. After a less than optimal experience in West Cornwall, we headed back and hiked on to meet @sjulier along US 7. There was still some debate about where to end the day. I complained about the lack of a plan and hiking aimlessly. Duke said it reminded him of how he thrived on other Marines complaining. So for about four more miles I very vocally shared my (exaggerated) displeasure with the day as Duke basked in it, laughing at me most of the way😂 I decided I would sleep in the dugout of a high school baseball field that we saw ahead. Big Ben talked me out of it when we saw a guard canvassing the property. So we hiked on, along the Housatonic River- a very comfortable stretch. We made it 25 miles to Falls Village, CT and camped behind a cafe that welcomes hikers. Unfortunately they were closed on Mondays, but we were still allowed to stay in the yard. When Duke laid out his tent, he realized he left his tent poles back at the road crossing. He had to get a hitch back to retrieve them and returned well after dark. It felt strange to be camping IN town, but this place was hiker friendly, the ground was flat, we were exhausted, and sleep is sleep. Tomorrow would involve crossing into MA and someone needing to be rescued on Bear Mountain, so it was best to get some sleep tonight.<br><br>#appalachiantrail #atclassof2018 #at2018 #atclassof2019 #at2019 #hiking #nature #travel #adventure #trektheat #hiketheat #thetrek #chucklovesatc #connecticut #mountains #climbing #backpacking #usmc"

It was Sunday. One mile into the day, we crossed from New York into Connecticut and were welcomed by this 6ish foot long ambasssssssador (pic). The trail cuts across the northwest corner of CT and covers just 50 miles, so we would only be there for 3 days. I remember being shocked by how beautiful CT was- so much moving water and clean, clear pools, waterfalls, pine needles covered the trail, fewer roots. Something about the air just seemed...cleaner🏞<br>.<br>.<br>Better than all of that was that today, we met Jukebox's family. We were met near the town of Kent by her grandparents, parents, and uncle. They brought us some great sandwiches, new (to me) beer, Gatorade, and snacks, including @nutterbutter !! The visits Kent-inued👈🏽😏 with Paddington's friend, Alex, joining the hike for the second part of the day. After trail magic we split up for the night in town. Ppl had different experiences in Kent. Paddington, Alex, and I enjoyed a nice meal and drinks, hidden in the back room of a tavern that was too nice for us. Our waitress was new and had a black eye and treated us great. While thinking back each day, some things stand out more than others. Zebra (THE NICEST person) and Rampaige (also very cool) got verbally assaulted by the alleged laundromat employee. See? Different experiences 😂 After a roughly 45 minute hot shower, Alex relayed that he NOW understands all the pain and struggle associated with hiking the trail. WE were sitting at mile 1468.4. HE had hiked 5 miles in and 5 miles out today. 🚫Paddington and I *politely assured* him that he had NO CLUE about the soreness involved and *kindly informed* him where he could shove his complaints👆🏽 We put a soccer game on TV, and I fell asleep before I had enough time to even see who was playing.

Doesn't help that the water is as cold as it possibly could be, but atleast it tastes great. Even had to build a log bridge over one with some friends as it was to deep and strong to safely get across. Every once in a while we are blessed with real trail which feels like absolute paradise. My pack finally feels like it's not 100 pounds and ready to break at any second which is nice too.

There were so many different types of bridges along the AT. As I look at the pics from each day to write these posts, I'm glad to see that I appreciated them in the moment, since the farther north one gets, the more scarce they become. Fording becomes a daily chore, and bridges get washed out by high rivers after the snow melts. .<br>.<br>Some folks used their long hours on trail to learn new things. Some tried learning a new language, others, audiobooks or the lyrics to We Didn't Start the Fire. I, on the other hand, learned from what distance I could hear traffic at an upcoming road crossing before a descent (0.7 miles) and how many steps it takes me to hike a mile. Of course both were dependent on terrain and elevation change, but I knew for me, 1/10th of a mile was about 200 steps. Paddington would laugh at me when I tried to pinpoint how far we were from a shelter based on the steps I had counted. That changed (for just a second) when we were low on water. We reached what looked like a dry river bed where we thought the water source was supposed to be. The options would have been to dig to find the water, walk upstream (dry) to see if water was close, or fashion a leaf to catch the slow trickle of dirty water. I took the music out of my ears and said ""this isn't it"". What do you mean this isn't it? ""This isn't our water. We have about 180 steps to go"". He didn't believe me, but the other options included filtering mud, so he reluctantly followed me away from that spot. From behind me I heard an annoyed<br>""6, 7, 8...<br>63, 64...<br>134, 135...<br>one hundred sixty si--"" ""We're here! Water!"" There it was. A flowing stream, about 1/10th of a mile north of where we originally stopped. <br>Paddington walked around me, taking his pack off. ""You were off. You said '180'"". I accepted that as his apology for not believing me. Gloating commenced, and we began to filter our new water. 😎<br>.<br>.<br>51.3 miles over the last three days, so I guess I was officially back. 🏃‍♂️<br>#appalachiantrail #atclassof2018 #at2018 #atclassof2019 #at2019 #hiking #hiketheat #chucklovesatc #nature #adventure #outdoors #water #toldyaso #camping"

Feelings toward shelters vs camping were split. When weather was a concern, nobody minded staying in a shelter. Other times, tenting was the way to go. Our group wasn't huge, but 5 open shelter spots was often alot to hope for. On this day we got to a shelter that only slept 5, but when we arrived, nobody else was there, so we were able to completely take over. Family shelter night!<br>.<br>.<br>Lots of times, during a conversation, someone would take the unpopular opinion and defend it, in order to cause an argument, entertain themselves, or simply keep the noise going. After a day of rain, we had our wet clothes hanging from the shelter to try to dry them. As we squeezed the water from our nasty hiking clothes, the water that came out was some color between gray and brown.  When everyone said how gross it was, I argued that it was in fact good news, since all the dirt was just released and my stuff was therefore clean. The real problem would be if the water was clear, bc that meant the dirt was still in your clothes. Brown water meant your clothes were now clean. After alot of back and forth, someone said to ""prove it by drinking the next water that you wring out of your now 'CLEAN'  clothes"". 🤢 I thought about it, like the scene from Friends when Ross had to drink the fat.

The day started at the lowest point of the entire trail, a zoo (pic) in New York- specifically the bear exhibit. We got split up in the zoo, and later, while talking about pics we took, we learned that BB and I took one of the same phone pole. It had a zoo sign in front of it stating what kind of wood was used. It was a phone pole. #cityfolk It was definitely cool walking thru a different scene that morning. Right after the zoo we crossed a hiiigh bridge over the Hudson River and climbed the next mountain. Back to the woods. We planned on stopping at a stealth camp site near a road crossing with a pump building with clean water. I read a comment in @guthookguides that there was a great camping area just down the road (away from trail) from the pump building. We wanted to scope it out, but some day hikers showed up. We wanted it to ourselves, so we hung around and chatted before trying to find it. As they left, another group and two dogs showed up. I snuck off to find the camping area while everyone else talked. It. Was. Glorious. A large flat field, 2 picnic tables, a bathroom. I headed back and gave the group ""the look"" while the others were packing up to leave. It was a go. Once it was clear, we hustled up the road and along a dirt path before it opened into the best kept secret..paradise. We picked our spots and camped without our rainflies. The only thing between us and the sky was the thin mesh roofs of our tents. We enjoyed an easy dinner. Duke and I played a game of chess. A groundhog visited. And even tho we were 0.1 from the trail, it felt like we were far removed from tomorrow when we would pack everything up, face north, and do it all again.<br><br>#appalachiantrail #atclassof2018 #at2018 #atclassof2019 #at2019 #hiking #zoo #animals #birds #baldeagle #adventure #trektheat #hiketheat #thetrek #nature #camping #merica #optoutside #chucklovesatc"

Knowing that the gang was hot on my *injured* tail, I set my alarm early. When I woke up in the dark, I found my water bladder next to my shoes, full to the top. The previous night, I wasn't really able to make it down to the water source. I knew there was water 2.1 miles into the next day, so I rationed with a plan to refill there. I had a good talk with a section hiker and her mother the previous night. We talked about my hike thus far and how it was my first day back after/during injury. She was kind enough to secretly fill my water while I slept and left it near my pack for the morning. No strings, no expectations. People on the trail are THE best people 🙌🏼 I left a short thank you note and set out from the shelter around 6am, getting to work, climbing a small mountain of spilled rocks. I took in the view of the NYC skyline and stopped for some quick pack-off time at the top of Black Mountain (pic). Pack-off time was a minute to stop, breathe, relax, regroup, and just center everything. Take a break from everything weighing you down, take in what's around you, shake everything out for a second, and gain some focus.<br>.<br>.<br> Life👏🏼 needs👏🏼 pack👏🏼 off👏🏼 time👏🏼<br>.<br>.<br>Next, up and over Bear Mountain, a really great hike. JB would later refer to it as Bear Hug Mountain, so obviously I wasn't the only one who enjoyed it. On the other side, I descended into Bear Mountain State Park and found Paddington, his mother, and his dog Bridget with Chief and an injured Doc (ankle). Duke, JB, and BB arrived, and all was right with the world again. We headed to Ft. Montgomery for the night. I had completed just 4.7 and 9.3 miles in these two days, but I thooouught things were starting to feel a little better... 😶<br><br>#appalachiantrail #nyc #atclassof2018 #at2018 #atclassof2019 #at2019 #hiketheat #trektheat #kindness #adventure #mountains #views #nature #scenery #chucklovesatc #hiking #optoutside #backpacking #philosophy"

We headed up the mountain at midnight under the moonlight and hit snow within the first mile. Time for my microspikes and ice axe, gear that I was getting very used to relying on. Once we hit the switchbacks, things got skeeeetch. We were avoiding a steep chute, so we bouldered our way up to the left, yelling “ROCK!” every minute. Two miles from the peak, we started our traverse. I started losing feeling in my hands and feet, but I concentrated all my energy to just getting to the emergency shelter at the peak. I’m hiking with a group of overachievers so we made it up over an hour before sunrise 🙈 Getting there too early and sitting still in an “emergency shelter” that was still exposed and full of snow offered up its own challenges. This is when I went from feeling like a total badass to feeling totally helpless (and maybe hyperthermic 😬). The guys took turns warming me up and shared their dry socks, jackets, and foot warmers. THANK YOU, THANK YOU TIMES A BILLION. A little after 5 am, we took in the stunning sunrise. I honestly feel like I blacked out for most of it though because I just wanted to get moving and warm up #trailrealities. On the way down, someone in our group (cough Kurtis cough) decided it was a good idea to glissade down the steepest chute of Whitney, the one we were avoiding the whole way up 🙄 Pretty soon, all of us were following him down the chute. I learned how to self arrest with my ice axe for the first time and it was trial by fire. Kurtis yelled to me and TB to stop glissading down and to traverse over. I left a trail of blood across the chute from busting up my knee. Little did I know that the reason we were traversing was to avoid a steep rocky cliff if we kept going down 🙈 I was very happy to hear that news AFTER I made it back to the trail. By 10 am, we all made it down to the Whitney base camp where we dried out our gear and took cat naps in the sun. In the afternoon, we hiked 8 more miles to set us up in a good position to cross Forester Pass early the next morning."

On the way back to the trail, there was a change of plans. Instead of getting behind the gang, I would be just ahead of them for day 1, and they would catch me on day 2. I didn't feel right, and I wanted that first day under my belt before I had to try to keep up with them again. Thunder and I talked on the way up about where her group might be. She got off in May to graduate from JHU and returned to the trail afterward, strayed from her ppl. With ZERO coordination, when we got to our road crossing, RAMPAIGE WAS COMING OUT OF THE WOODS TO CROSS THAT SAME ROAD! She informed us that Zebra was not far behind- one of Thunder's original tramily members. She thought he was days from there, so she was super excited to find out he was close. No planning in the world could have made that timing work better. We strapped on our packs and I told her to hide behind me. Zebra was shocked to see me back, and when Thunder stepped out from behind me, he was ecstatic to see her!! Reunion: achieved. My plan was to hike 7.9 miles and have the guys catch me by the end of tomorrow. I made it 4.7 before stopping to assess my leg. It wasn't good. I had that numb feeling when I stepped. It gave out easily any time I wasn't perfectly balanced. When I took the compression sock off, I could see how swollen it had gotten. I was worried I would need to call to be picked up one last time. At 4.7 I snapped this pic w @rampaigingaround and sent it to the group. Now I was committed to staying and told them all that was left for them to do was to find me. None of them knew it, but I was less than 5 miles from their position. As long as I could stand in the morning, I would see them at some point tomorrow! If you know Rampaige, this pic makes total sense. If you don't know her, your life is missing something. Find yourself a Rampaige. Seek to be with authentic, honest, caring, hardcore, hardworking, relentless ppl, and hope that some of it rubs off on you..if you're into that kinda thing.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #atclassof2018 #at2018 #atclassof2019 #at2019 #hiking #hiketheat #trektheat #thetrek #nature #chucklovesatc #adventure #travel"

Having left the couch of recovery and ventured to my brother's birthday dinner last night, I was feeling emboldened. My leg was feeling less in need of amputation, tho it hadn't really been tested at all, and I still couldn't climb steps. For the first time tho, I felt like returning to the trail was likely. The same day that the mental return switch was turned on, a friend who was a week behind us posted that she was about to get off trail for good. The trail differs from normal life in that everyone craves success for others as much as they want it for themselves. It's part of what I miss most- the lack of ulterior motives, the desire for everyone around you to thrive. In that spirit, I reached out to her, informing her of my situation. I asked if it would make a difference in her decision if I picked her up and she joined our group. She thought about it, and already being familiar with Four or None, she said being around us is 👉🏽exactly what she needed in order to continue👌🏽 We coordinated a plan for the following day, and spoiler alert, she decided to NOT get off trail.

The kids wanted to show me something upstairs, and I had to take each step sideways, still unable to completely bend my ankle without severe discomfort. When I moved my toes too far up or down, I felt pins and needles from my shin to my knee.

Before leaving Eckville Shelter yesterday morning, I was sitting by the road wondering how this would all play out. I was disappointed, nervous, obviously in pain, and a little worried about what was actually happening. I was pretty sure at that point, whatever it was, it had nothing to do with twisting my ankle a few days prior. I didn't want to quit. I didn't want to lose my people. They each took some time to come talk to me by the road. I remember each conversation that I had that day, especially with Big Ben, approaching slowly, looking sad, and asking..""So, about the Tenacious Tape..?"" Remember, when I crawled into camp, I told him I would give him my gear tape to repair his torn sleeping bag. 🤣 <br>After riding home, I spent the 2nd half of the day and all night on my parents' couch with my leg propped up on the recliner, elevated on pillows, alternating between hot and cold compresses. I started taking the Keflex I had carried with me in case of a skin infection. Things had worsened by the morning. And on day 2, I camped on the couch again, only getting up to hop to the bathroom and back. I still could not move my foot or put any weight on my right leg. I argued with my sister in law about going to the dr. I AM a dr.. I started antibiotics. What else would they do?? Also, this haaaaappened to be during the two week window when I was completely uninsured. I made the promise that if things hadn't improved by the morning, I would (ironically) go to a 👉🏽walk in👈🏽 emergency clinic. I made the promise because I *knew* that the Keflex would be working by then...right? <br>I followed the group texts as the guys continued communicating with each other on trail about snake warnings and tough climbs and where lunch would be... I was crushed, and they felt so far away. <br>A pic from a happier time when Jenn kicked off day 1 of the Hack Pack a couple weeks prior by taking our packs and meeting us 17.2 miles later when she surprised us with a picnic dinner at a pavilion.<br><br>#appalachiantrail #atclassof2018 #at2018 #atclassof2019 #at2019 #injury #hiking #nature #travel #hiketheat #trektheat #thetrek #pennsylvania #chucklovesatc"

The bruising had gotten substantially worse over night (pic). In addition, I noticed two distinct bumps near the area (pic2). When I woke up, my leg felt like it was made of lead. I had to put my hands behind my knee and pull in order to move it at all. My ankle and foot were locked in place by excruciating pain and swelling. Growing up, I had broken my arm, had sunburn so bad that it looked as tho my skin had boiled off, been stung by two jellyfish within seconds of each other (never again, Hilton Head), metal bicycle pedals to the shin, fishing hook to the knee, bee sting to the eye, been hit by a bad hop that left the imprint of the baseball's stitches on my face (Trevor), and had a sewing needle broken off in my heel for weeks during basketball season before having surgery to remove it (long story). The only thing that even came CLOSE to this feeling was when I had shingles about five years ago. Pain shot thru my entire body as soon as I tried putting ANY weight on it. I had the tough discussion, admitting to the gang that there was no way for me to continue.

As of 9:20am today, the Hack Pack was over. Dad dropped us off one last time, and we thanked him for everything as he saw us off- into the woods near the firehouse in Port Clinton, PA. It was dark and raining, not a down pour, but enough to make things muddy. There was a decent climb to start the day, after crossing Rt61. It didn't take long for me to fall behind. I could feel the twisted ankle from yesterday having an impact almost immediately. Paddington stayed behind me. Later he would say that he could tell something wasn't right. Around midday, we caught the rest of the group as they had stopped to eat. After the break, they quickly pulled away from me, and again, Paddington stayed behind me. At some point near the end of the day, he said ""Wow, you're really limping"". I snapped back ""Yeah, no ****! My ******* leg is killing me!"" That was probably a mixture of being wet and tired and the reality setting in that it was back to normal hiking from this point forward. I hobbled into Eckville Shelter and dropped my pack, physically drained and in pain. When I took my socks off, I noticed a disturbing bruise pattern on my right shin (ignore the cut from a nail sticking out of a log at a shelter- scar number two), just above the ankle that, until that point, I had blamed for the pain. The discoloration was inches above where bruising from a sprain would have been. After stopping for the day, the pain increased and my leg felt tighter and tighter with each minute. The saving grace for the day was that someone had pizza and breadsticks and said they were up for grabs. Big Ben had a rip in his sleeping bag and I offered some gear tape to repair it. I would get it for him in the morning (remember that). I hoped I wasn't overreacting as I sent a text to dad to warn him that I might need to be picked up in the morning if my leg got worse overnight. Fortunately we were only about an hour's drive from home. I chased my pizza with Motrin and passed out for the night. .<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #atclassof2018 #at2018 #atclassof2019 #at2019 #nature #legs #legday #hiking #trektheat #hiketheat #thetrek #chucklovesatc #travel #crocs #optoutside #injury"

The group had spread out a little bit today, and I was hiking alone. Something caught my eye ahead. Often, I would think I saw something, but after it being the sun or a shadow or a blowing&nbsp;leaf so many times, I had sort have been trained to almost ignore it. This was a little different, because what I saw ahead was moving at a slow but consistent pace and was a much darker green and black than the brown trail beneath it. When I was about 15ft behind&nbsp;it, I could clearly see the tan rattle attached to the 4-5ft snake. He was slowly moving north, and I felt astonishingly calm. Had it been a SOBO snake, I would have been more suspect. This was way different than my first encounter (day 61). I slowly walked&nbsp;behind him for a minute or two before I finally thought to record it. Before it slipped off the left side of the trail and over a fallen log, I managed to record just a few seconds (vid). It was a day of snakes as I saw about five others including a black&nbsp;rat snake that was at least 6-7ft long, just laying on top of a different log.<br>.<br>Later, with some of the group hiking together, my foot slipped on a rock. Jukebox was right behind me, and I heard, ""Ew! Oh my God, Hack! Are you alright??"" When hiking in slick sections or on rocks, it was common to focus only on the feet of the person&nbsp;in front of you. She said she saw my ankle turn in such a way that made her nauseous. It didn't feel any different than so many other twists and turns, other than the fact that I felt the ball on the outside of my ankle (malleolus) touch the ground, but I&nbsp;didn't feel any pop, so I figured it was nothing. We hiked on, and I felt like I was in the usual state of soreness, maybe slightly worse, but not much. By the end of the night, I didn't see any swelling, so I figured I was in the clear (to be continued).<br>.&nbsp;<br>Weeks ago, a family friend posted about Kowalonek's kielbasa and Easter dinner.

I think they were relieved to see firsthand that these people were much more than just some folks I was hiking with. 🤗 This was also the first time I saw my pup since 96 days ago!🐶 He was confused at first, but after I got on the floor (MUCH more difficult to get down on the floor and back up compared to the last time I saw him) to mess around with him and started talking to him, he got super excited and was tough to contain.

Mark took us back to the trail for the final time🖐🏽We were off to an early start, but I felt terrible. I was sitting in his front seat, hat over my face, eyes closed, in agony, battling some out-of-control nausea🤢 The ride was a quiet one, morning radio playing, but not really registering, just noise as I struggled to not get sick in Mark's car. Thinking back to the very beginning, I couldn't eat a thing for 3-4 days before starting in Georgia. I was so full of anxiety and uncertainty starting this journey that just the THOUGHT of eating made me want to vomit🤮 Back to today, with my face covered, mouth watering, and my arm pressed against the cold passenger side window, I kept repeating in my head ""Just get to the trail. Just get to the trail. Just get to the trail..""🏕 I heard the car turn off the pavement and onto the small gravel parking area at the trail head🚗 Thank you, baby Jesus. Somehow I made it. Let me out! If I got sick in the woods, who cares? No big deal. It's the woods, and I was seconds away from my safe place. Exccceeeeeepppppt🚫when I moved my hat from my face, Mark looked over and said, ""a friend is here to see you"". I looked up. <br>The news🎥<br>The F****** NEWS!📽📺<br>Mark had secretly asked a friend of his to do a news story on the hike and the fundraiser I had been working on, in connection to it. I wanted to choke him. The back of the car, my tramily, my people, the ones I relied on and trusted 100%..they ERUPTED🌋 in laughter. For some reason, this just made their day. I struggled thru a quick interview and we shot some *candid* b roll for the story. When the news aired, there were a few errors that the group busted my a** over for a loooong time, including that I started in NC (not GA), met up with a ""group of strangers"", and that the whole group was raising money for the organization that assists wounded veterans and their caregivers.

The lack of elevation changes and being able to leave our packs at Mark and Liz's resulted in some really, REALLY comfortable miles. The first 13.2 miles of the day were covered while on cruise control. The elevation stayed between 400ft and 650ft the whole way. The only issue was the left over rain that still pooled in some of the fields. I guess it was a fair trade for not having 1500ft climbs up and over mountains all day long. At some point we decided to take a break from walking in the heat and humidity and have lunch at the end of the next field🥪 As soon as we reached the spot we had picked out from a distance, we looked left, and 💥poof💨 a picnic table and a lake (pic). Not pictured is the possible, but definitely yes, meth lab RV just to the left of the tree. If one was going to live out their own Breaking Bad, this was as nice a place as any. We figured since it was midday, and because no fumes were in the air, we could cautiously make use of the perfectly good table and view. We kept an eye on the RV, but there was never any movement while we stayed. We talked about jumping in the pond, but upon closer inspection, the suspicion of leeches ended that talk. We just enjoyed our break, cleaned up, and kept moving. A quick climb up and over a small mountain, and we were almost there. We called Duke and made sure he found the rendezvous point, and shortly after we caught up to him, Mark arrived on his way home from work. We headed home for one more meal, two more desserts, showers, and a good night's sleep before leaving Carlisle tomorrow morning which would bring an end to Phase 2 of the Hack Pack. <br>#appalachiantrail #atclassof2018 #at2018 #atclassof2019 #at2019 #hiking #nature #lakes #optoutside #hiketheat #trektheat #thetrek #pennsylvania #picnic #table #lunch #travel #walking"

Early in the morning, @markkem1 dropped us off at the scene of yesterday's ice cream slaughter. We had 19.3 miles to do, and look at that sky (pic). We knew what was coming. We knew it didn't matter. I loved these farms around Carlisle, PA. It felt like free miles. Often we could look ahead and see the thin cut thru the crops for at least a couple miles, and it wasn't difficult to make good time. Music was safe, because with this kind of visibility, there was very little threat of being surprised by anything dangerous- wildlife or otherwise. Once the sky opened up, the farmlands had a tendency to flood immediately. A couple fields had convenient bridges that would *normally* help hikers cross the flooded stretches, but during this week, most of them were completely or mostly submerged, so we spent much of the day traipsing thru water up to our knees. One particular field had a VERY thin trail cut between two sides of waist-high grass. Paddington was in front, followed my myself, JB, and BB. Paddington was doing this weird thing where after a step, he would lift his trekking poles up and over the grass, out to the front, place them in the ground, walk thru, and repeat. I started to copy him, and looked over my shoulder to JB. She started to do the same, and BB followed suit. The three of us laughed at how stupid we were. If Paddington reads this, it might be the first time he finds out that he was the lead rower on our crew team as we floated across a farm for a couple miles, with our earbuds in, trying to catch Duke. I just HOPE 🤞🏼 someone saw us from afar and wondered what the hell we were doing. Mark had a car parked for us at the ATC at Boiling Springs, and the weather broke in time for us to enjoy a really nice walk into town along Children's Lake which had just welcomed a few broods of fuzzy baby ducks. We loaded up and headed back to Mark and Liz's for our second night of visiting, dinner, and desserts as the Hack Pack continued.<br><br>#appalachiantrail #atclassof2018 #at2018 #atclassof2019 #at2019 #hiking #nature #farms #fields #optoutside #pennsylvania #clouds #trektheat #hiketheat"

Being the resident mile counter, I was annoyed when this sign wasn't where it was supposed to be. We eventually got to it, but not until we were at least a couple tenths beyond the actual halfway point. There was a massive rock near the real one. We stopped for a minute to acknowledge what we had done. Paddington disappeared into the trees for a pitstop and inexplicably reemerged with an obscure, amber, unlabeled, (quickly dubbed) ""halfway beer"". There was a short attempt to convince us that we HAD to drink it. ""It's a sign! It was wedged in a tree right in front of me. YOU GUYS!"" 🤨 Everyone declined, until one irrational member took it, opened it, drank, and passed. Peer pressure being what it is, and ""four or none"" being our motto, it got to me and I saw no other choice. This returned us to the conversation of things @trailname would do, that @realname wouldn't even fathom. This fell solidly in that category. We hiked 17.2 miles to Pine Grove Furnace SP and the Half Gallon Challenge (the last ""halfway point""). We went 5/5 as a group, finishing a half gallon of ice cream in under an hour (in order P, D, JB, BB, H). First and second place were separated by seconds..one spoonful. Last place, not so much. We uncomfortably waited for @markkem1 to arrive. He came, met my ppl, and graciously took some smelly, tired, amazingly still hungry hikers into his home. They all met @shmuckers82 the boys, and Kona. When Big Ben introduced himself, we asked Benjamin if he was now Little Ben, and he replied, ""No, I'm still just Ben"". I loved seeing these two worlds collide. When in Liz's house, turning down dessert(s) is not an option. It was a relief that a few of us were still able to eat ice cream despite what just transpired. Hiker hunger is NO joke, and it was a relief that we weren't ruined for life...yet. <br>#appalachiantrail #hiking #tramily #family #icecream #food #halfway #hiketheat #trektheat #nature #storytime #atclassof2018 #at2018 #atclassof2019 #at2019 #nature #optoutside #camping"

Big Ben debated with an overzealous possible-park worker/probable-local cranky man about what plot of unoccupied park grass was deemed suitable for drying off his tent's rainfly. They settled on an out-of-sight-out-of-mind understanding. We camped at Quarry Gap Shelters. Two, four person shelters connected by a breezeway covering a picnic table, on which Duke and I played chess on a board that was there for hikers' use. There was a wooden porch swing, perfect for relaxing and recounting the day or planning tomorrow. There were plenty of tent platforms and a cold spring that JB was using to chill a small bottle of champagne that she packed out from somewhere 🥂🤷‍♂️ and shared with me on the swing. Another group of younger campers and their chaperones were there, and I spent the hours between sunset and bedtime learning how to play Euchre ♣️♥️♠️♦️At some point Paddington mumbled something about how much noise we were making as it was well after dark😴, and my s^@# talking increased with each round I won 🏅 with my teenage teammate.

We woke up in the morning to hear that the stranger in the shelter with JB, BB, and P dropped a bottle on Paddington's face during the night, so the noise of our game paled in comparison, and I was off the hook for causing the ruckus that kept them up the night before.<br><br>#appalachiantrail #hiketheat #trektheat #thetrek #outside #atclassof2018 #at2018 #atclassof2019 #at2019 #nature #camping #hiking #euchre #cardgames #chess #swinging #champagne #dogsofinstagram #dogs"

So you want to hike the AT? Here's a quick test near the Maryland/Pennsylvania border. The trail is the rocks. Follow the blazes. Can you find all three of them? The fact that the trail was out to break ankles today didn't bother me. We were about to enter PA. The trail was set up very conveniently for me- broken up almost perfectly in half: first half from Georgia to home, second half home to Maine. Late that morning, when we crossed into the north (Mason Dixon Line), I immediately 👇🏽 felt like the group became my guests, like I had some sort of ownership of the trail in this section and they were visitors in my home. It isn't easy to explain, but even tho I had never hiked in the area, EVERYTHING felt familiar- the trail, the trees, each road crossing, the air, the light, the sounds. Every. Single. Thing. felt as tho I had experienced it before, and it was exactly the feeling I had not realized I was hoping for, for over 2,000,000 steps, but somewhere deep down, I felt myself saying ""told you so"". It felt like an apex somehow. <br>Bottom left = Georgia. Top = PA, today. Bottom right = Maine .<br>👉🏽⛰👈🏽<br>.<br>It felt as tho I had reached the most significant part of the first half of the hike, and the momentum was on my side. For the next week and a half, I would get to share the ""Hack Pack"" (ref. slack pack) with my ppl. My family and friends would play a role every day for the next 11 days making our hike unique from everyone else's! Day 1 in PA ended with Jenn meeting us with an all-PA prepared dinner and a shelter full of students/scouts on a camping trip and a dog sleeping in a tent. One kid was covered in poison ivy, their gear was evvveerryywhheerreee, and none of it mattered, for I was home. 🏡<br><br>#appalachiantrail #atclassof2018 #at2018 #atclassof2019 #at2019 #hiking #nature #travel #camping #outside #trektheat #hiketheat #thetrek #pennsylvania #maryland #antietam"

This is one of my favorite pictures of the trip. It was taken at the original Washington Monument near Boonsboro, MD. Hiking the AT is grueling- there is no escaping that. This section wasn't even that difficult, but it WAS 1044.2 miles from where we started hiking. Stop 🤚🏽 Look 👉🏽 Onnnnne Thoouuuussaaannnd forrrrtttyyy foouuurrrr miles!👀 💀 And we were tired 😴 There's a turning point for every thru hiker when he or she realizes that discomfort and pain and exhaustion and so many other things that ruin a normal day at home are the new baseline. It's the price one pays to experience the trail for as long as they're able. Every bench or flat rock or log becomes a sofa. Dry grass becomes the most comfortable bed. Shelter walls are perfect ottomans. When Duke took this picture, I was asleep about 20ft behind him, in the grass on top of my tyvek footprint (plastic-like sheet that went under my tent) using my pack as a pillow. I would guess I fell asleep in less than two minutes. Hikers are hurt and tired and hungry and dirty and broken...and happy. Above all else, we were happy. I was probably happier than the others, for we were just 21.5 miles from Pennsylvania (home), and my mind was in a perfect place for the first time in years.<br>.<br>.<br>📸 credit: @dylan_duke_sharp<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #atclassof2018 #at2018 #mentalhealth #tired #sightseeing #nap #atclassof2019 #at2019 #hiking #hiketheat #trektheat #nature #outside"

We crossed into MD,  and our 5th state (WV) was history. Shortly after entering MD we reached Gathland State Park which included an empty mausoleum (thank you, spell check) built by a rich man who died poor and didn't have enough money left for his corpse to travel from NY back to his tomb. Instead, his body made it only as far as Philadelphia where he is buried. The empty tomb is there for the public to view, and for hikers to hike by, as a reminder to live your life well, budget your time and money, and manage for the unexpected.

Fortunately there are so many trail angels out there who leave gallons upon gallons at random road crossings so you don't have to carry 20 pounds of water.

Imagine working with a group of people all day long, hard work. Then after work, you go home with them, eat dinner, sleep in the same room, wake up at/before sunrise, and do it again tomorrow, and the next day, and every day. Then you finally take a day off from ""work"", but you spend it with that same small group. That's thru hiking. The good news for me is that the people I was with were perfect people. Supportive, funny, sarcastic, sharp, well rounded, friendly, warm, experienced, competitive, positive, perfect people. However...🤚🏽 we did spend 129 days in a row together, 3,096 straight hours together ⏳ We fought sometimes.<br>.<br>.<br>Feel free to add your input on a few of our arguements:<br>☝🏽Object: toy train<br>Question: Does the user PILOT the object?<br>✌🏽 Some of Rachel Carson's findings were not reproducible and some results were biased and careless.

Question: was the <thing> ever ALIVE, and can a human see one on earth today? ✊🏽Is being a mime considered a TRADE?<br>.<br>.<br>Tomorrow and the next day would cover 30.4 miles. The original plan was 21.1 and 9.3 into Harpers Ferry. Because day 1 included The Roller Coaster (a very difficult 13 mile section), I decided I would do 17.9 (stopping 4.1 miles after that part, instead of 7.4). I figured the 2nd day was going to be short either way, and stopping at the 1st spot included a chance of staying in a primitive cabin. There was no threat of rain, and the 1st stop included a steep 0.2 mile side trail, but something told me it was the right move. I was probably unreasonably stubborn, and the other three wanted to do the 21.1 on day 1. I said they should but that I was still doing my plan and would catch them the next day. I can't remember why it got so contentious but it did. I guess tomorrow we would find out which choice was better. 😓 What we all COULD agree on was that we missed our Jukebox, and things were better when we were together. <br>#appalachiantrail #atclassof2018 #at2018 #atclassof2019 #at2019 #hiking #nature #travel #hiketheat #trektheat #virginia #rollercoasters #thetrek"

During the 18.6 miles this day, we finished Shenandoah National Park, passed Front Royal, VA, stopped for a 45 minute lunch, and ended at Jim & Molly Denton Shelter. This place.... The shelter was clean, there was a solar shower, a large porch (center of pic), chairs, benches, a separate pavilion at which to cook (background of pic), a bear pole, AND A HORSESHOE PIT (far right side of pic)!! The horseshoes were safe there as no sane person would ever think to carry them off. We watched nature happen as a small cricket was stuck in a spider web. The spider was methodically isolating each leg as he kicked to try to free himself. Eventually, the cricket was strung out by each limb, and the spider left, presumably to return later for dinner. The shelter itself was amazing, and the pattern held true: when something was named for a specific person, it was going to be either really great or unfathomably difficult. Rarely, when a real name was involved, would the result be mediocre. For the next few days, our group would be separated again, as Jukebox would be welcoming a friend from home, and the two of them would hike together while the four guys were banished and hiked ahead. I think she was embarrassed of us. #notreally Leaving the Shenandoahs certainly felt like exiting something special. While it was sad to leave that environment behind, it sure felt good to definitively check off ✔ a major section and milestone of the trail. We would leave this perfect shelter tomorrow for another >18 mile chunk and the beginning of an argument.

The Shenandoah Mountains were such a unique place. Deer, bears, bunnies, porcupines, snakes, frogs.. the park definitely belongs to them, and we were just passing thru. It felt right. Of course @shenandoahnps capitalizes on the tourism with the waysides, and as (attempted) thru hikere, we were compelled to fill up at a few of them and send our postcards, but the stretches between the waysides and Slyline Drive crossings were really amazing. This guy (pic) was spooked just a little bit when we walked up on him. He was on the trail and jumped into the brush on the right side when we got to him. He started walking south, just off trail, watching us as he did. He started to run, crossed to the left side of the trail behind us, circled around, and crossed again, ahead of us, finishing where he had started 20 seconds ago. There was something about seeing him processing that we weren't a threat.

It rained off and on all day. Mostly on. We were making our way to meet up with Paddington's cousin, Maureen (video). Meeting the tram's family was always such a treat as the group really grew right before our eyes each time. I know it was comforting for our ppl at home to put faces to the names of those they had only heard about up until that point. On the way to Maureen, we stopped midday for lunch at Skyland Resort and Restaurant. We were wet, dirty, and hungry. We arrived about 15 minutes too early and had to wait in the lodge-y common room until the dining area opened. A few groups of two or three tourists and some family vacations spilled in. When the waitress began to seat those waiting, everyone was ushered to the left, across to the back of the room to sit along the floor-to-ceiling windows in order to enjoy the views of the mountains as they ate. Well everyone except us. 🤚🏽We were taken to the 👉🏽 right, down two steps, and seated in front of the partitioning wall in front of the kitchen...away from the humans. I ordered my first choice. The waitress returned to tell me they didn't have it. I picked choice #2. She came back- all out. I put my menu down and asked, ""Could you tell me what you DO have, and I'll pick from that?"" THIS 👏🏽 was the better of our two waitress this day. Maureen took us into Luray, VA for the night. After showers, while laundry was in, we went to a small bar/restaurant. Jukebox asked if the dark bar in the next room was open. We were told our waitress was also the bartender. Great. ""Moscow Mule, please"". When the waitress walked away, JB asked if we thought they could make a Moscow Mule. I assured her yes bc I could see copper cups. Then we saw the waitress take her phone out for an obvious Google visit. Duke laughed and said ""NOPE!"" She returned with the bad news. Jukebox went simpler, ""Vodka Soda"". A what now?

The structures along the trail, built for hikers to sleep in remained pretty consistent in structure, but their names changed along the way. In the Shenandoahs, shelters were called huts. In addition to the road crossings, the park had plenty of actual campgrounds.<br>At the end of this fourth day, we were 61.9 miles into SNP. We stopped midday at Lewis Mountain Campground (916.8) for lunch and ended the day at Big Meadows Campground to camp for the night (925.9). Just shy of the campground was our first Wayside experience. I envisioned the waysides as being shacks on the side of the road with snacks for sale. In reality, they were smaller versions of rest stops you might see on any turnpike. They were larger than I imagined, usually a gift shop (t shirts, postcards, etc), a bathroom, a small cafeteria type room, and a counter with the kitchen behind it where one could watch their burger or chicken fingers or pizza or soup or grilled cheese, but ALWAYS a blackberry milkshake, being prepared. After filling up, we headed to the campground 1.3 miles north, and I thought, this is quite a comfortable way to hike. The forest was thick (picture), and after the bear meeting, it was always exciting to look thru the trees while hiking, always optimistic that the next wildlife meeting was just around the next turn. <br>#appalachiantrail #at2018 #at2019 #atclassof2018 #atclassof2019 #nature #hiking #shenandoahnationalpark #camping #optoutside #trektheat #hiketheat #thetrek #travel #virginia #trees #milkshakes #burgers #skylinedrive"

The great part was knowing that after taking in the view, and a few hours of work, we would be standing atop the mountains others only observe from their cars.

A group of southbound day hikers stopped us to tell us that at the top of the next climb, a mama bear was eating with her three cubs. I was thrilled to know ahead of time that we were about to see our first bears of the trip. We readied ourselves, made the climb, and stayed alert, looking to the right the whole time. I didn't know how I would feel when I finally saw them. How close would we be, how would they react to us? We made a sweeping right turn, and there they were. Mama with her back to us, two cubs off to her right, maybe 15 yards away from her. We made some noise so nobody would be surprised that we were there and then did the responsible thing, took our phones out for pictures. Mama was about 20-30ft away from us, a big tree just to her left. We could hear her crunching away as she ate. The babies kept poking their heads up from behind a fallen log, grass and green leaves hanging from theirs mouths, looking at us, then looking at mom before ducking back out of sight. We stood there taking it in for about five minutes, nobody ever realizing that we were told there was a mom and THREE cubs just ahead. We saw mom +2. Later I wondered if we got real lucky, not getting between mom and the mystery cub or if the day hikers were just messing with us claiming there was a third baby. Either way, when mom turned around 180° to face us (albeit in a non-threatening way), I said seee yaaaaa and walked around the others to continue on. I felt at ease the entire time.

We hung around Waynesboro for the first half of the day and resupplied in preparation for Shenandoah National Park, the next stretch of 103.1 miles. At the southern entrance, there was a small wooden stand. In a tiny box we found the permit we needed, and Paddington tried to enter our group information on it. As he began to write with the dull  pencil, the rain started to cause the thin paper to disintegrate. By the time he finished it was a pathetic excuse for a permit, but I clipped what was left of it onto his pack and away we went- legally. At least we tried. At the top of one of the first climbs, Big Ben started laughing and I heard him call back ""Hack, take my picture! I'm in the Shenandoahs!"" I looked up to see him standing in front of some massive antennas emitting a threatening hum near a fenced off section with numerous danger warnings. There were times that we would hike the entire day from start to finish and never encounter a man made object other than what we carried with us. Day 1 of the Shenandoahs was NOT one of those days. I snapped Big Ben's postcard pic, and we mosied on northward. <br>#appalachiantrail #shenandoahnationalpark #nature #travel #hiketheat #trektheat #thetrek #atclassof2018 #at2018 #atclassof2019 #at2019 #satellite #backpacking #postcard #tourist #optoutside"

The plan was to cruise 19.1 miles today from Devil's Backbone Brewery all the way to Waynesboro. We secured a slack pack from Stanimal's and set off in the rain that would later give way to fog and mist. The views were eerie as someone any more than 20ft ahead would start to fade into the fog like Shoeless Joe in Field of Dreams. It was a mostly easy day of hiking, having eaten well the night before and shedding our backpacks for day packs with minimal weight (snacks and water). It WAS..until it wasn't. At some point the failure of my gear began. The bottom of my trekking pole got wedged under a rock, and when I pulled it, the top 2/3 came off, leaving the bottom third still in the ground. It made it over 850 miles, and I had put them thru quite a bit. Even tho I was feeling as good as I had to that point, my gear could not say the same. I collapsed that pole and hiked on with one until I was able to get my actual pack back and do some field repair. My other pole would break not much later, and I would have to continue with them duct taped and super glued back together. They would come into play much later, in Maine and be part of one of my favorite stories of the whole trip. When we finished our day, we were just one mile short of Shenandoah National Park, John Denver was in heavy rotation on the mp3 player, and that could only mean one thing: BLACKBERRY MILKSHAKES!!!<br>.<br>. 🎶Shen-an-dooo-aaahhh RIII-ii-vveeerrrr<br><br>#appalachiantrail #atclassof2018 #at2018 #atclassof2019 #at2019 #hiking #nature #trekking #trektheat #hiketheat #broken #poledance #leki #optoutside #virginian #shenandoahnationalpark #blackberry #milkshakes"

Having been absolved of our trail sins, we left The Priest Shelter. We hiked down from 4100ft to 950ft, crossed a suspension bridge and climbed back up to 4000ft. If we are counting curse words, my sinless streak ended by midday. After the 15.5 mile day, I managed to snag a hitch on my very first try. I probably bragged about my 100% success rate a little too much (it's the legs). Unfortunately, it appeared our driver had already spent some time at the brewery before he found us. We hung on for dear life in the back of his pick up truck as he zipped down the slick mountain road. As the rain dripped down, we laughed at the prospect that THIS is how it would all end. Not surprisingly, our driver knew just where Devil's Backbone Brewery was and we somehow arrived alive. We set up our tents in the designated hiker area on their grounds and hit the bar/restaurant. Groups kept rolling in, and everyone had a really great night. When the bill came at the end of the night, I was about to alert the waiter that he accidentally gave me the tab for the entire table. Then I saw him handing Paddington his check and, in a haze, realized we had been eating and drinking for FAR too long, and that really added up. I forget just how much my tab was, but I remember being shocked and appalled at the amount I con$umed. All was not lost, as I did get to see my first moose of the trip (spoiler alert- that's the closest I got to seeing a real life moose). While Zebra and I used the bathroom sinks to get semi-clean, a local walked in as we peeled the mud off our legs. No words were exchanged as everyone went about their business. When he left, the game of Hiker or Homeless was born, whereby one would observe a behavior and try to decide whether the person was an AT hiker or a homeless person. The longer we hiked, the blurrier that line became. I closed one eye tightly, signed my receipt, and retreated to my tent a couple hundred yards away for music and some deeeeeep sleep. <br>#appalachiantrail #atclassof2018 #at2018 #atclassof2019 #at2019 <br>#beer #moose #brewery #hiking #travel #adventure #camping #thetrek #hiketheat #drunk"

What was the sense in getting too far ahead? We stopped in just about every creek that we could for a dip, and sing-a-longs were a regular occurrence. On this particular day last year (which happens to be @sarahharringtonq’s birthday), I was having a party in a thunderstorm with my tramily at Virginia’s Dismal Falls, with not a care in the world aside from staying away from the local water snakes and not getting struck by lightening while consuming tallboys outside during the storm.

Yesterday we crossed over 800 miles. The numbers have stopped making sense and the miles really started to...fly...by. 🐜 This sort of distance felt ludicrous. Day 70 ended at the famous Priest Shelter. There, the log book acts as a confessional. While reading thru the confessions, I was reminded of two things about the AT hikers around me: they were impossibly hilarious, and they were the most vile comedians since The Aristocrats. We spent over an hour reading thru the notebook, collapsed over the picnic table with tears streaming as we struggled to catch our breath. Some of the stories gave me a cramp from laughing so hard. My favorite of the entire book happened to be from the first hiker I met on day 1. He said ""I ran out of Body Glide (roll on friction reducer) weeks ago, and I've been using chapstick ever since for the 'important parts'"". I could NOT stop laughing at the thought of chapstick and ""important parts"" and the person I knew who wrote it. There was also a lively discussion among those eating dinner about how certain waste gets handled. More detail would be detrimental to some professional adults, so I'll leave that story right there. 🤚🏽 The night ended with Rampaige getting to camp and hurling a rock in the assumed direction of a persistent whippoorwill, our nemesis. Throughout it all, I was repeatedly reminded to notice the small things (pic).

I've been missing these guys something fierce with what's gone on these last few days. It runs deep with these people and I will never be able to say enough good things about them. .<br>The poor dinosaur blew over during some bad storms earlier this year. The pictures I see of him from hikers this year show two hideous orange straps keeping him grounded. It's hard to look at. Poor guy. .<br>Before leaving the town shelter, we hit up the local gas station and bought their entire stock of microwavable breakfast sandwiches. Microwavable? Whaaaa? Yeah, the shelter had electricity and a functioning microwave from the mid 90s. Paddington put his sandwiches in as Big Ben enjoyed his already heated croissant. When P pressed start, there was a weird humming noise, distinct from the sound of any functioning machine. He yelled at BB for breaking it. .<br>BB matter of factly: My stuff is hot. Is yours?<br>P: NO!! BB matter of factly: Hm, seems to me that YOU broke it then. 🤣<br>.<br>We called for a ride back to the trail, but we would be leaving without our boy, Duke. His feet were in such back shape that he was forced off trail to see a doctor. We would later hear that the issue was what we all knew..trench foot. The constant wetness and long days had taken their toll on his only mode of transportation. As we left him to wait for his ride, he assured us he would be back as soon as he could. I had no doubt that he would be.<br><br>#appalachiantrail #moist #atclassof2018  #at2018 #atclassof2019 #at2019<br>#hiking #virginia #nature #outside #dinosaur #trektheat #hiketheat #microwave #breakfast #travel"

There was no cell signal from any of our carriers so we split up to rub elbows with the groups of ppl coming off the river with their kayaks and tubes. Jukebox and I secured a ride into Glasgow with a friendly guy, his wife, a few kids, and a dog. The others managed to get a ride into town where we saw the dinosaur and set up camp at the township AT shelter. Glasgow maintains a shelter near a field with supplies and a shower. It was nice to refuel, get clean, and be comfortable for a night with the only expense being the meal at Scotto's- a trail town Italian restaurant. At dinner, we found Needles again! Paddington pulled a tick out of his leg, and Jukebox mailed it home with a pair of deplorable socks so @billiewyeth could have it analyzed (the tick, not the socks). Paddington ordered his meal, a milkshake, and a piece of cake. When the waitress started to walk away, he politely stopped her ""oh, no no no...tell me about your pies"".

Wayne, Indiana). I made it thru all of April per @reddeadhiker and @reddeadvixen 's challenge. Now it was just a game to see how long I could go. I didn't know all of these numbers at the time. While out there, it was just another mind trick to keep things moving and try to break the monotony. The plan was to slack pack 7.8 miles where I would meet my mom and dad who drove down to see me and meet the tram. This would be the 1st ✔ family I had seen since leaving mom, dad, and Brain at the Springer Mountain parking area over two months ago. I moved faster than expected and beat them to the extraction point by about two hours. Waiting isn't my thing, so I went 5.8 more miles and met them at the next road crossing. We headed back to Daleville for my third meal at Three L'il Pigs BBQ ✔ in two days, and my tramily met the first part of my family. I got to meet a lot of the gang's friends and family, and it was always fun hanging out with people who knew the old version of my new friends.

Mustang was one of our favorites. We all befriended Mustang separately before becoming a tramily. We all had our own Mustang stories. Unfortunately, his plan was to get off trail once he reached Virginia, which he did. But fortunately for us, he's awesome and came back to meet us once we reached Daleville, VA! He brought us cold drinks and made a shampoo run (twice). It was so great to visit with him and hear his distinct voice again as he picked up the jokes right where things ended weeks ago. He assured us that the ability to stand up in one fluid motion would return about two weeks after we were done. That would later prove to be a generous estimate. Seeing one of our own looking like a normal human being again was a reminder that everyone else was still living normal lives. When Duke's friends came to meet us and take us to dinner, ordering multiple entres, seeing Big Ben at a restaurant in his thrift store outfit, and feeling buzzed from one tall beer, all thoughts of being back in the regular grind of the off trail world quickly disappeared. At the motel I shared a room with Trainwreck and Needles. We all piled into our other room where the rest of my ppl were. There were probably about 12 of us in there. At some point, we played a game with Needles, having her guess who different facts were about in our tramily. It was a fun way to a. get to know everyone better, and b. see how we were perceived by someone else. We also played Guess My Age by asking someone two questions like: how many ppl can you name from #savedbythebell or did you ever own a #trapperkeeper<br>We got pretty good at entertaining ourselves and the group of ppl I was fortunate enough to meet grew a little larger. ✊🏼 #appalachiantrail #atclassof2018 #hiking  #atclassof2019 #outside <br>#at2018 #at2019 #hiketheat #trektheat #thetrek #virginia #nature #tramily"

For the few days Jukebox and I hiked together before our group developed, wake up was 8am-ish. I would leave a little before she did. She would get moving around 9am. Things have changed. Today, we woke up at 4am 🌛, packed up, and moved out by 430am with our headlamps being the only light. The plan was to hike up 1000ft in just less than two miles to be on McAfee Knob for sunrise. As we hiked in the pitch black, I wondered what sort of critters and animals were able to see us that we couldn't see. The ground in front of us was lit up by our headlamps and the insects were chirping. In the distance we could see tiny white specks of light traveling in groups of three or four- the lights of other groups hiking with the same goal. It was a unique feeling, being surrounded by people with a common objective that in ""real life"" would seem silly. We made quick work of the approach and reached the top well before sunrise. Small pockets of hikers arrived and found spots to sit. It was relatively quiet with anticipation. We had reached the most photographed spot on the trail, but the sky was thick with fog. I worried that yet another view might be lost. Some fired up their stoves to make coffee or heat breakfast. The sky turned from black to something between dark blue and purple. Then pink, and with just minutes to spare, the fog lifted from the valley, and we witnessed one of the most stunning sunrises I've seen from just about the best vantage point I could imagine. Everyone politely waited for a turn to have their picture snapped. I was in awe of the lack of bickering or cutting. With the sun rising and time being of the essence, everyone got their pictures and nobody hindered the process with selfishness.

The last couple thousand feet were basically all covered in snow which made finding and staying on the actual trail hard. Some stretches were straight up the side of a snow wall which requires digging your feet in and using your trekking poles as to avoid falling down the side of the mountain. Easily the most epic and awesome hike I've ever done. Then over the course of the next day and a half we dropped 9,000 feet, some of which I was able to ski down with shoes (so much fun,) back to the hot and windy desert floor. Since it was Cinco De Mayo, my two friends hitched into town to get some Taco Bell and were picked up, brought back to trail, and had everything paid for by this amazing lady who's son I had actually hiked with for a while on the AT.

The scenery was very remincint of the Sierra's and it was great to drink fresh mountain spring water again. So cold, clean, and fresh. Got off trail to resupply in Idyllwild and ended up getting a nice cabin like room with the guys I've been hiking with. Master chef @grizzly_hikes cooked up some mean spaghetti bolongese with cheesy garlic bread, and @matt_johnson6 and @projectmove_ made eggs, bacon, and pancakes for breakfast.

Our two groups (pic) split up a shopping list and packed out everything needed to end the day with an old fashion campfire cookout. It's not uncommon to pack out something special for dinner for that first night out of town, but this was little different. Almost all of us were carrying something that would contribute toward a group dinner: hotdogs, buns, condiments, graham crackers, marshmallows, Hershey bars, chips, etc. This group effort felt like a big deal. We weren't necessarily hiking the day together, but spread across the miles for the day, 🚨we were all carrying different components that would come together for something special👈🏽 When we reached the end of the day, we got to witness one of the best sunsets (from the hill directly behind us in the pic). When choosing which picture to use for today, I passed right by the pictures of that sunset, because I knew which one I wanted to use.

I'm telling you, if every mile of the AT was that last mile into town, it would have taken me less than two months to finish. Hiking came easy on these days. We ended at Angel's Rest Hiker Haven and it couldn't have been named any better. The workers were friendly, check in was smooth, grounds were nice, firepit, multiple clean bathrooms, and loaner clothes. I really liked it there. This was another stop that almost everyone I knew was there the night I was. We even got to see Rick James, formerly Hika Hika, but he's another story for another day. Big Ben and I stayed up way too late playing chess in the main cabin over drinks. But I was enjoying getting to know him better. And he drank more than I did, and I like winning games, so.. 🤷‍♂️🤣 The best part of the day was that my first pair of new shoes arrived. These are the same make and model of shoe (pic). Of course I knew my first pair was breaking down (in Marion I managed to sew a hole closed with floss- inside of left shoe near bottom shoelace), but I didn't realize just how bad until I slipped these new clouds on my poor feet. Rejuvenated. 🤚🏽👉🏽It's funny how when damage happens over long stretches of time, you sometimes fail to see just HOW bad things have gotten until you can step back and really assess things (ref: life). I went back and forth about mailing home the old shoes that carried me 635.4 miles. For me, to feel this strangely attached to anything was so far from the norm. I ended up tossing them and immediately regretted it, but it got easier each time. Tomorrow would be day one with my new pair 👟 It would he a six day stretch between towns, and tomorrow would turn out to be a really, really good one 🌭🍔🍫🐁🌄 #appalachiantrail #virginia #hiking #nature #trail #outside #shoes #atclassof2018 #atclassof2019 #at2018 #at2019 #hiketheat #trektheat #altra"

The names they used for places in Virginia were unfortunate. Just past Bland, VA we crossed over mile 600. Getting to hike with my group gave the trail a completely different feel. It no longer felt like the nearly impossible task that it was. It wasn't just me against some giant anymore. It was all of us against the giant. There was something calming (pic) about having other eyes and minds contributing to plans. I'm glad I didn't stick to my initial idea of trying to do the entire thing alone. We made the choice to go a half mile off trail to Trent's Grocery to feast on hot dogs, fries, sandwiches, milkshakes, and soda. This was our fifth day out from town, so we also did some quick electronics charging while we ate. After getting back on trail, we took a falsely labeled side trail that was more than the 0.3 miles AWOL advertised. But it was well worth it to see Dismal Falls. Way back at the boss trail magic before Damascus (unless you're Canadian), we were told to NOT miss Dismal Falls. It was the right call. Intel from previous AT hikers is gold. We finished the day at 617.6, and we were one day away from the end of our first planned section as a group. This is going well.

The plan today was *only* 18 miles. I hiked a big chunk of it with Big Ben ( @benjourden ) and ahead of the group for a change. There were long stretches of relative flatness during this day and even on the climbs I managed to keep up with him, which, for me, wasn't easy. But today, things felt really good. We talked about j- jiu- joo-ji-schew ( @awyeth ) and his plans to return to the gym to continue his training after healing from the trail. We talked a little about the group he had been hiking with since he knew them much better than I did- Thunder, Zebra, and Trainwreck. Our two groups of four were always around each other, an extended tramily of sorts, all very awesome people. My day ended at a stealth camp site we had picked out, and Big Ben hung around for a bit before pressing on six more miles to the next shelter. When I was alone, I took to gathering and breaking firewood and found some large stones to make a fire ring (pic). There was just enough room for four or five well placed tents. While making sure the flat spots were clear of large sticks and rocks, it really felt like I was cleaning my place for guests who were to arrive shortly. Just as planned, they did arrive. Duke got in first and got to meet my parents as I was just ending a facetime call. We sat around a fire, far removed from anything man made, ate our dinners, retired to our tents after dark, and for the first time did what would become our goodnight ritual.

We (allegedly) packed up from the schoolhouse and headed out. There were plenty of fence stiles today, because we were in and out of farms for the majority of it. When I was hiking by myself, I walked thru a farm with a group of large jet black cows. It was eerily quiet except for their breathing and footsteps. When I entered their space, they did not ignore me like the other cows. They stopped eating, stood alert, and I swear got into formation to secure the right flank. I stood looking at them wondering if it was safe to pass, and when I looked back to my left, the other group had silently assembled on the trail ahead of me blocking my way. I went thru the same procedures I had with the stray dog with possibly ill-intent: noise, clapping my trekking poles together, etc. Much like the dog, they didn't take the hint. I took the long way around them, carefully avoiding their *#$& with my beat up trail runners. Eventually I made it thru the hostile gang of cows but managed to completely screw up the next farm (pic), taking a wrong turn and hiking most of the way up a mountain on the wrong side of the road. At some point, I decided I would go up and over it anyway, until it turned due east, and I knew I was heading even further off course. Eventually I turned around, got back to the last spot I knew was correct, still couldn't figure out what I was supposed to do, and opted to road walk a mile and a half to O'Lystery Pavilion. I took a quick break before the 2.2 miles up and over Brushy Mountain to Knot Maul Branch Shelter (559.8) where the rest of the group had already ended the day. When I FINALLY arrived, @thunder_in_the_mountains offered me what was left of some fudge, and I met @rampaigingaround<br>and was in awe that she was hiking the entire thing in Crocs.

There was an option to go six more miles to a campsite, and the weather was absolutely perfect. Instead, we stopped at a tiny 1800s schoolhouse that was part of the Settlers Museum of Southwest Virginia and a pretty nice place. The sun was out, there was a breeze, and the small bubble we were part of was just ahead of us. We made the choice to lay out our gear to completely dry, tour the museum, and eat. We relaxed and talked, getting to know more about our new family members sharing some stories about ourselves. We met a dog and the woman who runs the museum. She was extremely kind. A local church stocks some bins inside with snacks and drinks and supplies. On odd local out for a day hike stopped to chat with us. The off the wall conversation with him made us happy we had a group now. It was nice knowing ppl were going to have my back for a little while. We *may* or may not have slept on the floor of the schoolhouse that night. It's a gray area, but it's not technically allowed, therefore, I don't remember if we *did* or didn't.

Have been going a little slower as I found some really nice people to hike with and am waiting on a care package to arrive on Monday at a town not to far away. It's been a lot drier, which in turn means longer water carries and a heavier pack. Had a 17 mile dry stretch today so when I finally reached water and was offered a ride into Julian I couldn't refuse.

At the shelter last night (after I assume everyone spent some time in quiet reflection having witnessed my perfect bear bag hang), Paddington and Duke talked about their motel reservation for the end of the following day. Having been demoralized by the cold, the rain, the wind, and the lack of a pony encounter, I told them I'd love to crash that plan and split the cost. Jukebox was in the shelter, and she jumped at the invitation to join. A shower, laundry, town food, a bed, a roof...of course! Day 51 started early with 19.2 wet miles to cover. Today was different tho. Today, I had to end at a certain point by a certain time, because a group made a plan. From the beginning, I knew I was the weakest hiker in the group. Making this plan as a team gave me a sense urgency, accountability, and responsibility that I hadn't really had until this point. I remember saying that it would be nice to stick with these three for ""as long as I could keep up"". We reached Marion, VA (533.7) and checked into our motel. Laundry was gathered and showers began. After a walk back from resupply, I announced that I bought a half gallon of ice cream for the group and perhaps the most impractical purchase a hiker has ever made- an ice cream scooper. Sure we could have dug in with our titanium spoons, but I believed feeling like a human in town for our first night as a group was important. As a tramily, we didn't finish the ice cream- a far cry from what five seasoned hikers would accomplish in one sitting in less than two months at the halfway point. We laid out a plan for the next 101.7 miles, and in the morning, we would head out...together, the single best tramily the AT has ever assembled. .<br>.<br>We would eventually pick up BigBen as our 5th member, but unfortunately, only 3 of these 5 would end up finishing the trail together. .<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #atclassof2018 #atclassof2019 #hiking #nature #outdoors #travel #virginia #optoutside #at2018 #at2019 #icecream #food #trektheat #hiketheat"

The gas leak smell the night before subsided when the hiker was convinced cooking in the enclosed top level of the shelter was not ideal. Some (un)lucky shelter-mates woke up to this song 🔊 blasting from my phone. Today was a big day. In less than two hours, we would all cross over 500 miles 💪🏽Shortly after starting the day, I was already soaked and freezing. Two miles into Grayson Highlands State Park, there was a small parking area and small bathroom. I hustled over to it to duck out of the wind and rain and get some feeling back in my hands, feet, and face. As I opened the door, I found my idea was not unique. AquaMira, 50 cents, and Chips were already huddled in there. They pulled me in, telling me there was room. We took a classic AT bathroom selfie that I unfortunately don't have a copy of. If you know AquaMira, please tag her, so I might get it! 🤳Trainwreck and @thunder_in_the_mountains showed up, and I left with them to continue searching for ponies along the way north. Unfortunately, they had retreated to wherever wild ponies go for safety. I caught up to Mojave. She went around Fatman Squeeze and I went thru it (the quicker route). When I came thru the other side, she was somehow ahead of me and disappeared in the fog. I never caught her. I think she actually vanished. Those who know Mojave will understand that, that MAY be a possibility. At Hurricane Mountain Shelter that night, I complained about how nobody got to see the ponies. Those who beat me there said they HAD seen them. I assumed they were giving me a hard time bc I had talked about seeing them for days. When I called BS, they showed me all the pics they got with them, including Wheat who managed to perfectly catch the moment one bit his hand/arm. I was so jealous that for the rest of the way, whenever we spotted an animal, @awyeth would yell ""Hack, look! Ponies!"" Relentless. I salvaged the day with possibly my best bear bag hang of the whole trip. 🐻🚫 #appalachiantrail #atclassof2018 #atclassof2019 #travel #nature #fog #horses #ponies #poop #trektheat #hiking #hiketheat #at2018 #at2019 #virginia #graysonhighlands"

Fortunately unlike the last water I had it didn't taste like a lake. Then I proceeded to climb up (and a little bit of down) for 15 miles til I reached some spruce trees where I took a nice ciesta again. Then shuffled two miles to the little village of Mt Laguna where I got a Gatorade and met some fellow hikes. One of whom hikes the Appalachian Trail last year too.

Ideal hiking conditions today.. juusssssttt kiiidddddddiiinnnggg. There were so many days on trail when the weather was just perfect. After the ice and snow and monsoon season (March and April), with the exception of > 100° days in June and July, and the fact that we didn't see the sun in Maine in August, things were really great. For real we had lots of nice weather. The rough days just stick out in my memory more. It's difficult to see in this video, but I remember I was just smiling and laughing, thinking about how ridiculous the whole situation was. This was on Mt. Rogers, the highest point in all of Virginia. There was nobody else around, it was raining again, and my stuff was whipping around like I was hanging on to the wing of an F-15. I was laughing because there was NOOOO reason to be dealing with this. One of my pants pockets somehow literally blew inside out. Everyone out there CHOSE to do this. Get in a car, go home, be comfortable.👈🏽 👉🏽 It could all be so easy. So final. But nobody did. I kept seeing the same people every day or two, just like I always did. Same people, different backdrop, new experiences. One such experience was at Thomas Knob Shelter that night (this year, the location of some early concerning bear activity) when the non-aggressive spotted  skunk that lived in the walls of the upper level was not the most shocking thing of the day. Instead that award went to my first encounter with Napoleon. He poked his head in the shelter to deliver one of his shock value stories and challenge us to ride a wild pony the following day for 8 seconds while in the Grayson Highlands. Most of us agreed to accept the challenge because it seemed like the quickest way out of the conversation. He left not long after, and the only concern from that point was the smell of propane/gas coming from the second level of the shelter. I'm sure we will be fine. <br>#appalachiantrail #atclassof2018 #atclassof2019 #horses #hiking #nature #weather #skunksofinstagram #napoleon #at2018 #at2019 #optoutside #hiketheat #trektheat #trail #virginia"

Early on day 47, I entered Virginia before he did, and after a short wait, captured him crossing the border on video. 👉🏽 There is something about reaching Virginia. The state covers about 1/4 of the entire trail (almost 550 miles). Everyone knows that once you cross the line, you're IN it, in it for a loooonnng time. You've left three states in your wake, but it's said that the mental game really starts in Virginia (ref: #virginiablues ). We reached Damascus and checked in at Woodchuck Hostel.

Today was going to be a big one. Unleeeessssss, the best trail magic of all time was set up less than two miles into the day and 💫🎩poof💨 plans had disappeared. Bobo and I met a group of AT thru hikers from a few years ago. They shared their stories, full bar, seemingly unlimited menu, campfire, and laughs. Before I knew it, the Jack Daniel's was gone, breakfast was eaten, lunch was on the way, and 2.5 hours had passed. The trail angels told us how they pick a weekend each year and reunite on the trail to do it huge like this for the current class. I started to shift my thoughts from wanting to do the whole thing solo to maybe craving the camaraderie they managed to hang on to for years. I wondered if I would be part of a group like that at any point. After all, I was 450 miles in already and had kind of avoided said groups. At some point I realized 19.3 miles was NOT happening today. This stop changed everything. As I (slightly) stumbled away, I was called back to the cooler. ""Huh uh. Nobody leaves without a to-go beer."" A can was shoved into a Croc on the back of my pack, and I was off, assuming that if I wasn't hiking north, someone would have stopped me. 👈🏽👉🏽☝🏽🤷‍♂️ #appalachiantrail #trailmagic #tennessee #virginia #at2018 #at2019 #hiking #nature #optoutside #atclassof2018 #atclassof2019 #hiketheat #trektheat #jackdaniels #canadian"

This is Watauga Lake from ~3600ft. At least part of it can be seen for about 12 or 13 miles of trail. The trail goes around the lake and across a dam before climbing the next mountain. On the skinny trail alongside the lake, I was confronted. A black and gray dog was on trail facing my way as I followed a turn to the left. Normally I was happy to see any dog. This felt different. I stopped. He stared. I didn't see any owner or any other hiker. I couldn't go left because it was a steep hill covered in trees, and right was the lake. He didn't seem interested in letting me pass. Nor was he looking for someone to scratch his ears. I noticed the fur on his snout was gone as if worn away from being tied up somewhere. There was no collar on him. His tail was motionless, and his ears were back, and he was still staring, standing in the same place I found him. After staying still for about 30 seconds, he let out something between a sigh and a growl. I yelled ""bad dog"" and ""no"" sternly, hoping that he had some sort of training and would run off thinking he was in trouble. He took two slow steps toward me. I hit my trekking poles together, ""No! Bad!"" I carried a small leash (pic 44) the entire way for a case just like this🐕 but this pup was not in the mood to be rescued. I wasn't sure if there were any houses around from which he might have escaped or how long he had been in the area...or how aggressive he wanted to be.

Ok, first, in my defense, I am NOT a morning person. The previous night, @benjourden and I shared my bear line to hang our food. When I was packing up in the morning, I was missing my small inflatable pilliow. I pack in an organized, systematic way, so when something was missing, it stood out. I moved everything to look for it, because it couldn't walk off by itself. I often started the day without breakfast. So my food hanging from a tree wasn't my priority when I was missing gear. After rearranging my stuff...again and checking the bottom of my pack...again, it turned out that it accidentally made it into a friend's pack since he had a very similar pillow. Finally, I got our two food bags down, and everyone took off separately. Muuuucccchhh later, Ben did an impression of me getting ready in the morning which involved alot of picking things up, moving them, and putting them down again. It turns out he just wanted his food from my line so he could start the day which began with a fairly huge climb right off the bat. It appeared that I was just unorganized or procrastinating, when poor Ben just wanted his food bag, but we didn't know each other well enough for him to say ""hey, so yeah, hurry your ass up.

But today's weather was perfect. Today included some gigantic rock stairs, a really great waterfall, and new people. I ended at Laurel Fork Shelter (421.4) with Trainwreck, @jmwildrick  @benjourden @kkerschner75 and  @jeff.leeson  About 100 yards from the shelter was a waterfall that could be used to clean oneself off and do laundry- new experiences for me. @guthookguides had comments about a nuisance spider in the shelter.

He told me he missed that bastard of a turn, and by the time he realized it, he had already trudged over a mile past it. He said he couldn't get any more wet and muddy than he already was, and refused to back track so he continued on the last five or six miles and made it to town as the sleet turned to snow. We continued on our way (mine, the wrong way; his, north). About two months later, I would receive a text (pic) from Bobo stating that he had accomplished his goal of hiking from the start of the trail in Georgia to his front door in Maryland, just off trail. Evvverrryyyooone knew Bobo.<br>Evvverryone had a Bobo story.

Waking up in the barn, the scene was ludicrous. The wet clothes that everyone took off last night were frozen solid in the morning. It was so cold overnight that shirts and pants and socks looked like those drawn by a child- flat, solid, and two dimensional. @reddeadhiker was trying to thaw his boots and laces with his gas stove. When I left the barn, I was wearing almost everything I had packed. My face was completely covered- PSP beanie, hood, buff, and sunglasses. The sun was not out, but the sunglasses were the best way I could come up with to keep the sideways sleet from hitting my eyes. I hiked a chunk of the day with part of a group called the Gooch Gang. On top of Hump Mountain, the wind was so strong, we kept getting blown off the tiny six inch trail (pic). To stay upright, we had to lean into the wind and hope it didn't let up for a second, or we would fall the other way. After summitting, the trail retreated back to the brush, and I learned about ""tree avoid!"", a technique to alert taller, less-observant hikers of low hanging branches crossing the trail. I was with the Gooch Gang, et al as we all left NC and entered TN for good (mostly). The day ended at the new @stationat19e a bar/hostel started by one of the most hiker-friendly guys I met. Things were so new, bunk beds were still being built. Because of the weather, it was packed, and I was able to meet a bunch of new people. Downstairs at the bar, there was a gigantic fireplace drying dozens of exhausted shoes, and I spent some time talking to Wheat and learning about bugs. I also ran into @benjourden and Trainwreck, and Ben bought the last blackberry beer 😭 After karaoke started, I settled in upstairs and chatted with Bumble Bee, Shiver, and @walktheparks - all new interesting people. @walktheparks is doing something pretty cool, so if you're into state and national parks, check him out. Tomorrow would bring with it another first ☝🏽, so I dozed off to the muffled concert happening downstairs. <br>#appalachiantrail #at2018 #at2019 #nature #hiking #optoutside #atclassof2018 #winter #atclassof2019 #tennessee #karaoke #hiketheat"

It was not a big mileage day, but it was a tough one. There were a few ups and downs in quick succession. No drastic elevation changes, but things were made difficult due to frigid temperatures, pounding rain, and relentless wind. The side trail to Overmountain Shelter was another puzzle. At a ""t"" intersection, straight continued north, turning left revealed an information sign about the shelter and surrounding area, right was a marked trail to water and...maybe the barn/shelter? After turning right, the side trail had another side trail. One route was marked ""water"", the other wasn't marked at all. I picked a trail and a quarter of a mile later, I was regretting making the wrong choice just before the barn finally appeared thru the fog. Within a couple hours, the upper level was littered with about 25 freezing hikers trying to dry off. Tents were hung and taped to the walls to try to keep the snow and wind from slipping thru the spaces between the boards. A card game had started, music was exchanged, and plans for a trip into Boone, NC were finalized. When an hour had passed with no new arrivals, our concern turned to Bobo who should have arrived by now. The conditions were such that it would have been irresponsible to go back out looking for him. During the night the rain turned to sleet and snow. When thunder sounded, more than a couple ppl could be heard nervously sighing and from the corner Jukebox cried ""Boboooo!"" But Bobo was nowhere to be found, and we were hunkered down for the overnight storm. While there were plenty of fun times on trail, it was painfully obvious that tests would keep coming throughout the trip: physically, mentally, emotionally, financially. Today's test came in the form of a winter storm along the NC/TN border, and someone was missing. <br>#appalachiantrail #hiking #outdoors #barn #winteriscoming #winterishere #snow #nature #weather #atclassof2018 #atclassof2019 #at2018 #at2019"

A day out from another historical AT spot, but today was for views like this and feeling small. Long days like this (20ish miles) provided hours and hours for thought, and music, and second guessing, and deep breaths, and wondering what was ahead. The day ended at Roan High Knob Shelter (380.0). We tried to get a fire going, but everything was wet, so it was short lived. One girl was talking about a version of Secret Santa that I unsuccessfully tried to implement back home last year. There was an agreed upon price limit, but all gifts had to fall into the categories ""Alive or Illegal"". I guess, bonus points if you find a gift that satisfies BOTH ✌🏽 requirements. Once again, I spent some time with world travelers, @reddeadhiker and @reddeadvixen , at the tiny fire. @reddeadhiker had a small notebook of graph paper and was meticulously drawing the unique shelter from the vantage point of our dinner seating/fallen log. He shared some of his other drawings of buildings that caught his eye because of their architecture. He had also been taking some phenomenal photographs along that way, and he shared those too. I was reminded once again, that all of these hiker trash hikers that I saw every day were so much deeper than they appeared and so many had such amazing and unique talents. I fell asleep feeling jealous that my drawing skills were only adequate for Pictionary when competition and speed could be blamed for the gross lack of detail. Tomorrow would be tax day, but it would end up looking more like Christmas as the weather in the Appalachian Mountains continued to destroy the credibility of hillbilly meteorologists, even half way thru the month of April. <br>#appalachiantrail #atclassof2018 #atclassof2019 #hiking #travel #optoutside #camping #hikertrash #hike #at2018 #at2019 #trails #mountain"

Just when (for the time) bigger miles started feeling a little more comfortable, winter was about to return. But for these two days, it felt like I was really moving. Seeing this sign reminded me that the trail was there long before I came walking thru (completed in 1937) and will be there long after I'm gone. Once you take your first step on the AT, the hike never really ends. And in a situation like this, I think the best you can do is try to make things better than they were before you showed up: packing out (a SOBO's) trash, being respectful in towns, offering advice to the following years' classes, volunteering your parents' house for those coming behind...then asking your parents if it was ok 🤷‍♂️.

A nero into Erwin, TN and a stay at Uncle Johnny's hostel. 6.2 miles was now a nero (near zero miles) day. Eventually, anything under 10 miles was loosely considered a nero. Interesting how expectations change. The room I stayed in had a TV with Netflix, so as my electronics charged, I was able to watch a hilarious Chappelle special with Bohdi Drifter/Power Chicken. His stand up provided some much needed laughs. That night, I left a camp fire to sit on the porch out front and avoid the crowd. Around 9 or 10pm a group of 3 hikers were dropped off and were staying the night. While talking to them, it came up that the one with the backwards hat was from York-ish, PA. We talked about my connection to the area, and it turned out he had a connection to the Delaware beach areas as well. @megan34339 would later send me an article about a guy hiking in 2018, and it turned out to be him. Finally after this whole journey was over, I would realize that he posted a question on IG about my initial gear list, months before I even left. If the world is small, the trail is a tiny island of society. The next day, I was the most popular kid in town when a package arrived from @fe2pluswoman that included her famous plate-size cookies and some Rice Krispie Treats. It made the snacks I bought for resupply (pic) look pretty inferior. The snacks I received from home allowed me to ALMOST ignore the fact that my replacement socks were delivered to the wrong address as the saga with the post office down south continued. Of the 4 packages I received, 3 had now had an issue with their arrival. <br>#appalachiantrail #hike #hiking #usps #tennessee #pennsylvania #nature #optoutdoors #hiketheat #atclassof2018 #atclassof2019 #at2018 #at2019 #outdoors #getmebacknorth #nobo"

Somewhere south of No Business Knob Shelter (reigning champion of Best AT Shelter Name, 337.6), the game changed. It took over 300 miles for me to see my first snake. The weather, to this point, had alot to do with it. This guy was hiding behind that rock and I didn't see him until my right foot was on its way down to complete my step. It startled me, and I kicked that right foot to the side to avoid stepping on him. I instantly realized that I was in a bad position: one foot on each side of the trail and what I had to assume was the most venomous creature on the east coast looking up directly between them. Precarious to say the least. This wasn't the last snake encounter of course, nor was it the most entertaining (See day 61). For hours after seeing this first one, each long stick I saw on the ground seemed to slither just a little bit. With each new snake, almost none of whom ever showed any aggression, that paranoid post-encounter time shortened.

Into Hot Springs yesterday, out today. While talking with Cribbage and Hawk, they told me about the challenge they gave themselves of not taking a zero day in the entire month of April. That lined up well with my plan to make up time from those first three weeks (four zero days), and since I was already at 11 days straight, I joined that challenge too. On my way thru the main street of Hot Springs, I ran into Ramblin' Man. He was quiet if he hadn't met you, long gray beard, seemingly on a mission to hike only, and at times, aggressive and contentious. I really liked him. The few times we were at the same shelter we got along just fine. Not everyone could make that claim 🤣 He didn't appear to be in any rush to leave town, and I asked if he was hiking out that day. He said he was not, in fact he was done. Done??? Done with the AT. It turns out he was only using these first weeks as a warm up. He would fly out to the west coast in a couple days to start the #PCT <br>Talk about being knocked down a peg. I was feeling strong and confident. Over a MONTH in to this thing, approaching 300 MILES, working my way thru my SECOND state. And now this? A guy probably twice my age just quietly did the same exact thing as a 👉🏽 warm up?? His REAL hike hadn't even started yet??? Pretty wild. Fun fact, one of my friends from my hike is doing the same thing right now! @rampaigingaround (remember her from losing her cell phone to a waterfall?) Just finished the first part of the AT with her uncle @gregclaypool attempting a thru hike. Now she's headed out west to continue her quest for her triple crown. If you're looking for someone new to follow, there are two more for you, one AT, one PCT. <br>I wished Ramblin' Man well, continued thru town and heard my name called from across the street. Jukebox was waving, saying she was staying in town and would catch me later. I wondered if we would cross paths again. <br>The views during the climb out of town were incredible.

The steps into town were always the easiest. Hot Springs, NC (274.5) had at least 2 hostels, a library, laundromat, dollar store, and a deli that made milkshakes. Hiker heaven. I stayed at Elmer's. Elmer had his rules...and a gorgeous border collie named Jimmy Carter. The best rule was no cell phones in the common area. If you were there, you should be relaxing and/or interacting with other human beings. Surprisingly, I liked the rule. There was a music room, full of instruments to play if you felt so inclined. I arrived before my bed was ready. I was offered a couch in the living room which I grabbed immediately. From the music room behind the closed door, I heard some of the most beautiful piano playing I've heard. It lasted for about 20 minutes. The door opened slowly, and my friend Jukebox appeared!! I didn't know she was here!<br><br>H: Was that YOU??!<br>J: PPSSSHHHHH!!! NOOO! <br>She introduced me to her friend who walked out of the music room behind her. I told him how impressed I was, but apparently not impressed enough to remember his name 😶 Realizing that sort of talent was just out there hiking a 2,190.9 mile trail thru the mountains was really cool. I wondered what else I was surrounded by without even knowing it.<br><br>The following morning, Elmer had the option for a sit down all you can eat vegetarian breakfast. I passed, but everyone said it was amazing. Despite skipping breakfast, a couple hours later, I would NOT make the mistake of missing one of the best send offs any trail town could offer. <br>#appalachiantrail #at2018 #at2019 #hiking #vegetarian #outdoor #nature #thetrek #atclassof2018 #atclassof2019"

Another really helpful sign. Just 1,914 miles to go 🙄 In reality, it was 1,923 miles left, but hey.. 🤷‍♂️ Just above the sign, you can see a gate. There was a forest road and parking for a few cars. I stopped for a pack-off break and some water, and a pickup truck pulled up, followed by a small car. The driver of the truck exited, opened the (covered) bed, and I readied myself for some sweet, sweet trail magic. At the same time a serious looking hiker grabbed his pack and poles from his back seat. The truck driver walked back around holding not a drink or fruit, but a very expensive looking camera.

It was eerie to be unable to see anything past 20ft from where you stood. This time I didn't feel cheated out of a view. I think I had come around to realizing everything that I saw (or didn't see, ref: wild ponies in 240 miles) was exactly what I was supposed to experience during this trip. Letting go of expectations and just letting things happen made a big difference. As I was crossing over the summit, i looked down and saw that someone had dropped their trowel. It caught my eye because it was the same one I had been carrying, just black instead of green. The wind had stolen it from someone ahead of me. There was nobody within shouting distance, and with limited viability, I couldn't see anyone else around. I ran into other hikers at Walnut Mountain Shelter (261.4). I asked if any of them were missing their Deuce of Spades trowel. The Marine I remembered as Duke from Fontana Dam checked the back of his pack and realized he had. He thanked me and asked where I found it. *regret creeps in* <br>@patontheat : Oh, umm.. it was on top of Max Patch. ..is. 👉🏽Is on top of Max Patch.<br><br>@dylan_duke_sharp : You didn't grab it?

That's where I would eat, get clean, do laundry, eat, relax, and eat for the night. Laundry was interesting, as there was no washing machine, rather an actual washboard and a sink. Better than nothing, and a new experience ✔ The dryer took about 2.5 rounds to dry cleanish clothes. But it was a short day, and we all had time. Everyone was laid back and happy around the fire, picnic tables, and stream.....and then a blacked out pickup truck and tinted windowed van sped up the quiet dirt mountain road and armed, vested US Marshals swarmed a hostel employee, identified him, cuffed him, and removed him. New experience ✔ One of the officers came over to the fire to caution us about who we engaged with during our hikes and explained that this arrest was a result of some heinous acts involving minors. It was definitely a reality check as things had started feeling safe and comfortable, being surrounded by the hiking community, who less than 4 weeks ago were complete strangers. I think it probably reaffirmed most of our thoughts about the importance of looking out for each other at all times.

More insane views on a clear Easter morning. I stopped at multiple overlooks, taking in 3 or 4 little towns from different angles for about 6 miles, feeling jealous. I knew families were waking up and kids were looking for their eggs and baskets. And I was just..walking. Almost the entire day was down hill, 6,302ft to 2,592ft. I was forming a blister on my heel- 1 of only 2 days that I had blisters. By the end of the day, I was at Davenport Gap Shelter with a stellar group (Paddington, Chief, Doc, Honey Badger, Snicker Bear, Penguin, Coors, Smiles, and Spaniard- bonus story in comments🙌🏼). I talked to my dad on the phone. When he asked how the last few days were, I said ""good, but I have a blister that hurts every time I step. Paddington is about to sew some thread thru it, so it'll drain tonight"". He asked ""Sew THREAD thr-.. Who's Paddington?!"" I found that answer over the course of the next 1,900+ miles, but that night, the best I could come up with was, ""I don't kn-.. just...Paddington. I gotta go before it gets too dark"". He called for his headlamp, a sewing needle, and some hand (blister) sanitizer, and in the morning I was back to whatever 100% meant now. While filtering water, a large commotion came from ~50 yards down the hill. When we looked down, all we saw was a bush and a few small trees shaking as sticks snapped and something disappeared into the woods. We assumed a bear, but we never saw it. Fortunately that shelter had a floor to ceiling fence where a front wall would have been, so we were safely locked in for the night. We were 0.9 miles from the north end of the GSMNP. We had missed massive snowfall in the Smokys a week prior, and the following week, they were about to get hit again. My weird start date and amateurish pace actually paid off this time.<br><br>#hiking #appalachiantrail #outdoors #camping #awol #atclassof2018 #atclassof2019 #mountains #at2018 #at2019 #bearsofinstagram #storytime #northcarolina"

By the end of today, there were just 15.7 miles left in the Smokys. After feeling cheated by the non-view at Clingmans Dome yesterday, today was slow going because of countless views like the one pictured here. I remember feeling vindicated(?) each time I stopped to take it in, because after yesterday ""the trail owed it to me"". 👉🏽But as the experiences began to outnumber the miles, it became clear that in this transaction, I was the one with the debt to pay back, not the other way around. After a day full of awe, camp was Tri-Corner Knob Shelter (223.0). The sun was out til late in the evening, and the shelter had a metal roof. It was perfect to dry wet clothes from the past few days. I got to talk with a guy named Paddington quite a bit as the grounds teemed with weekend hikers. It was Saturday evening and the day before Easter, and there were at least 50 people camping there that night. Advice from clean people setting up camp less than three miles from their cars was..abundant. Paddington gave me a pack of LifeSavers that he had been carrying but never found a reason to eat. They didn't make it five miles into the next day. They tasted so good, having not eaten candy in almost a month. Tomorrow was Easter, and it wouldn't have been right to NOT encounter something that most likely came out of a cave. 😱<br><br>#appalachiantrail #at2018 #at2019 #hiking #hiketheat #nature #outdoors #atclassof2018 #atclassof2019 #camping #mountains #easter #jesus"

I hiked to the top of Clingmans Dome and climbed the sweeping ramp to the top of the tower. I had reached the highest point of the entire 2190.9 miles. I was Rose, arms spread at the front of the Titanic. And I could see as faaarrr aaas...50ft?? Yet another cold, rainy, foggy day. Interestingly, nobody seemed to mind. The general thought was ""Well, no point in wasting time up here. Can't see ****."" But we still HAD to climb the tower. I mean, highest point of the whole deal, right? After leaving, the trail heads to Newfound Gap, a large park and parking area where one would hitch a ride into Gatlinburg. I was still trying to make up time from that wasted zero in Fontana, and I had plenty of food, so after a quick break and a fun conversation with a tourist family with two young daughters, it was off to the rock steps up Mt. Kephart, but not before laughing at the most helpful sign ""Katahdin Maine 1972.0 (miles)"". It was really 1983.6, but whatevs 🤷🏽‍♂️. During the 1.5 mile, 800ft climb, I flew by so many locals/tourists in their clean shoes that I almost started to feel like a hiker. Things started to feel real, but I would have a strange thought tomorrow that would later embarrass me and I would regret, once I became someone who could say ""I hiked the AT"". #appalachiantrail #at2018 #at2019 #hiking #hike #nature #outside #camping #gsmnp #smokymountains #trektheat #thetrek #atclassof2018 #atclassof2019"

Regardless of all the ups and downs of the day, my brain mapped out a plan and my legs carried it out. I have notes in my book on other days that show what plan b and c were, but not on this day, and rarely at all, going forward. The excitement was building for tomorrow: cross over 200 miles, and hike to Clingmans Dome, the highest point of the AT (6658ft) and home of the 100 mile view. Spoiler alert, the view was MIA. In two days, I had crossed off 29.7 miles of GSMNP and had just 41.9 to go. Even better news, a hiker named Jukebox was somewhere behind me, closing in, and we were on a collision course to meet in the next week!

If you look closely in pic 6 you can see how close the church wall is next door. The tour guide said that they used this passage to the church as a means to distribute beer during prohibition.

I was ready to enter the GSMNP. What I knew was that there were multiple reports of aggressive bear activity- so much so that the first two shelters of the park had signs warning against staying in or around them, and that recent bear activity had resulted in death. They did not define ""recent"", nor did they explain whose death, the hiker's or the bear's. There was a ""gang"" of eight or nine bears stealing unattended packs, approaching hikers, and looking for food. When I read gang, I assumed they had jean jackets with the sleeves cut off and red bandanas hanging out of their back pockets, but I was never able to confirm that, fortunately. Having taken FOUR zero days in my first THREE weeks, I understood that my pace was not going to cut it. I made a choice, crossing Fontana Dam that I would limit zero days going forward as much as possible. The first day in, I did my biggest day to that point, 17.4 miles and a climb from 1700ft to 4914ft. Welcome to the Smoky's. But just like that, I only had about 55 miles left in the park. ***Little did I know, I was about to hike the next 61 days straight/859.3 miles without taking a day off.*** After leaving Fontana Dam, NC, I would not take another zero day until Harpers Ferry, WV, but much of that wouldn't be alone. 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♀️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️ #runforrestrun #appalachiantrail #atclassof2018 #atclassof2019 #hiking #outside #nature #at2018 #at2019 #northcarolina #westvirginia #creativeneros"

It didn't arrive yesterday as planned, so I spent my 4th overall zero at the lodge waiting for the 3pm mail. By the time it finally came, it was too late to start the hike into the Smoky Mountains today. I decided to leave the lodge to stay at the Fontana Hilton Shelter because if I slept inside, I knew I wouldn't wake up and move out early tomorrow. So I forced myself out of comfort, slept outside, and it turned out to be such an important decision. At the shelter 1.2 miles south of the start of tomorrow's climb, I got to hang out with quite a few people. Around the campfire and during some interesting conversations, I started to get to know a new group, one that included a guy named Big Ben, Thunder, Zebra, Trainwreck, and Fog. I also got to talking with a big Marine, who introduced himself as Duke.

On my third zero day, I relaxed at the Fontana Lodge where I ended yesterday. I ate two more large meals at the bar restaurant, nervously enjoyed the view of what was to come (pic), did my laundry in the only working machine in the Village, met Mustang, enjoyed a great talk with him, and learned that the food I mailed forward hadn't arrived as scheduled. That was the food that I needed as I would enter the Smoky Mountains immediately upon crossing Fontana Dam in the morning. This would force me to wait until after 3pm TOMORROW for the mail to arrive. I failed to convince anyone to play mini golf in the middle of the Village, and the ice cream shop hadn't opened yet for the season. Rough zero. When I went back to the room that evening, Hot Legs entered thru the sliding glass door that connected our room to a first floor patio. He looked disappointed, shaking his head, stating ""I think I have become uncivilized"". I asked what he meant. ""I just stood up from the chair out there and almost started to pee...on the tree..by the parking lot. And we have a bathroom 20 FEET AWAY!"" It was eye opening to see how fast changes happened when we were in nature 24 hours a day for just three weeks at that point. Instincts and priorities changed. He headed to the actual bathroom, and any non-hikers with rooms in view of our patio were spared. I bought Guthooks for the bear warnings and water source comments and quickly realized what a mistake it was that I hadn't done so before that point. It was a game changer. I settled in for the night, annoyed that tomorrow would be a late start because of these mountain town post offices, limited hours, and inefficient deliveries. I fell asleep in a warm bed in a comfortable hotel, reading about confirmed ""aggressive bear activity"" and warnings to not stop in certain areas or leave backpacks unattended even for a bathroom run, because evidently, bears were waiting and tearing into camps and packs looking for food.

Right by the shelter, low, basically lures for bears and mice and other wildlife. Not good. Some of the views this day were ruined by dense fog. Others turned out really cool BECAUSE of it. The day ended with a quick tour of the bougie shelter nicknamed the Fontana Hilton- room for at least 20 hikers, shower/bathroom building, electricity, hot (less cold, really) water, a view of the water, firepit, and a solar charging station. I, however, spent the night at the Fontana Lodge in Fontana Village, splitting a room with Michael (last seen at Lazy Hiker) who was now ""Hot Legs"".

My only note in AWOL for day 18 pretty much sums it up. I added ""things named after people"" to the list (ref. Sassafras) of things that will be bad news when you get there. The climb out of Sweetwater Gap was tough enough that there were logs staked into the ground to act as makeshift steps. Over time, they have worn and become mostly buried. Day 18 was another day of cold downpours, so that climb was a muddy river and the barely existant ""steps"" were usless. I remember thinking how difficult the section must have been in GOOD conditions. But on my day, every step forward slid a half step back downhill. But had I not kept taking those +1, -1/2 steps, I would have just been sliding down the hill SOBO. It was like walking on a stair climber, never really getting anywhere. Exhausting and frustrating. I was, however approaching Fontana Dam, one of the bigger milestones I had early on.

Well, day 15 wasn't anything like that. I was awakened by a harsh, cold pressure against my face. It was the roof of my tent, weighed down by snow and ice from an overnight storm. When I opened my tent, there were 2 or 3 inches of snow covering everything. I packed up my frozen gear as soon as I woke, and I broke camp, resentful of those who had shelter spots.

That Monday was spent in Franklin, not hiking. The forecast turned out to be wrong. The snow and rain never came, the skies were clear, and temperature was above freezing. I felt like I was wasting a day, but I also knew it was good for my knee. I decided to walk the town of Franklin to see why it was labeled such a renowned trail town. Outdoor76 was a great outfitter. They had plenty of gear and even more advice from willing experts. They had a large sign on which hopeful 18ers were encouraged to add their names. Adding ""Hack"" to the sign that already had a few dozen signatures was another step toward making things feel real. We talked about different ways to alleviate the knee pain while still making miles, I met their resident chocolate lab, and I recieved my free bandana. I used that bandana to wrap around my fuel canister before storing it in my cookpot the rest of the way. I noticed early on that any moisture caused the bottom of the can to rust, and the bandana prevented that. I got to the Lazy Hiker Brewery before noon and spent some quality ""recovery"" time there. A few hikers I had met arrived shortly after (Stylo, Ringo, Flobo, Michael), and we greeted each other as tho we were all locals in a hometown bar. It's difficult to explain, but it felt weird that it felt so familiar. I signed another 2018 AT sign and headed back to Baltimore Jack's to settle in for the evening in my glorified and oddly comfortable prison cell of a room- a small, private room with a bathroom, kitchenette, and broken tv.

He's such a great resource and asks for nothing in return. Gooder Grove is the other option in town, and from everything I hear, Zen is just as great at what he does over there.

It will be time well spent, and by being part of the trail, it's a story you should know. <br>The weather was about to turn again, the following day.

Four miles into the day I reached Deep Gap. Near the dirt road/""parking area"", I was surprised to see about eight people accompanied by horses (footpath only). I stopped for a quick drink and was approached by an enthusiastic SOBO- my first encounter with the wild species. He asked if I could make a phone call for him. He approached me because he thought we shared a Boston College bond because of the shirt I was wearing- a situation that would prove irritating over the next five months. He had finished his section hike when we met but his car that he had hiked back to was locked behind a park gate because the six mile dirt road had flooded. I asked what he was looking forward to most and his answer, as expected, was a huge meal, a shower, and a bed. I spoke with the horse whisperers to find out they were carrying the supplies to build a new privy at the next shelter. This goes back to my previous shelter experience when I realized and appreciated just how many people were involved in laying the ground work for what I was doing. Leading up to the hike I singularly focused on myself and what I needed to do to be ready. Being immersed in it with nothing but time to think, I started grasping the breadth of it all. In my guide book, I wrote a note that day 10 was the ""easiest day so far"". I probably should have bought that knee brace earlier. The only bad part of the day was the hike to water at Carter Gap Shelter (93.3) which was straight down hill to an almost standing pool of mosquito soup. BUT while waiting for the smallest trickle of water, I DID get to talk to One T and Raindance again for a bit. We met around a campfire on night 1 and again at ToG. Other than that it was just a quick hello as they passed me before noon each day.  I didn't know it at the time, when we were collecting drops of water with my honey bun wrapper (I eventually got better at carrying what I needed WHEN I needed it), but they would each give me my next little bit of trail wisdom by day's end tomorrow.<br><br>#appalachiantrail #at2018 #at2019 #horsesofinstagram #hiking #atclassof2018 #atclassof2019 #nobo #sobo #nature #mosquito"

During the previous night at ToG hostel, talk turned to my complaints about my knee pain. There were about six of us talking. I said I was going to try to get into town on day 9 to see the local doctor for an MRI, the same one @snakesonablaine would see for his stress fractures around the same time, before we had met. One hiker in the group listened to what I was experiencing and asked the room for a show of hands of who WASN'T feeling similar leg pain. No hands. None. It was difficult to accept that this was the new normal. It was suggested (lightheartedly) that I quit being such a.....*****, and hike out in the morning. I loaded up on ibuprofen, bought a brace, and moved out. The pain eventually worked itself out, but I became dependent on the knee brace until PA. During day 9, I stopped at Plumorchard Gap Shelter (mile 73.5) for lunch, the last shelter in Georgia. It was there that I realized the scope of how much work and how many people are involved in the maintenance of the trail that changes lives every year. Plumorchard is a massive THREE story shelter. A sign inside reads, ""This shelter was made possible through a partnership that involved the: US Forest Service, Georgia AT Club, Upper Loft Design Inc, Army 5th Ranger Training Battalion. November 1992"". The shelter was built offsite and brought in via Army helicopter to be put firmly in place. I started realizing how large this trail REALLY was, and it had nothing to do with the 2,117.4 miles that I had left. <br>#appalachiantrail #at2018 #at2019 #hiking #nature #army #atclassof2018 #atclassof2019 #georgia #northcarolina"

The sun looks like it is super high to be just starting the day, but this was still when it was in the teens and 20s in the morning, so moving before the sun was out didn't make much sense. I was happy to have survived camping alone and was exhausted, because sleep came in, at most, 15 minute chunks. I was apparently camped on an animal super highway. Footsteps outside my tent woke me each time I dozed off. I assume mostly mice and squirrels, but at least twice I could hear some real mass and snapping twigs. Probably just deer, but enough to make me wonder how curious (and hungry) whatever it was might be. To discourage anything from getting too close, I eventually fell asleep to music playing from the ipod. If something decided to end me during the night, at least I would know they had decent taste in music. Going down Powell Mountain en route to the road crossing to Hiawassee, GA and Top of Georgia Hostel, I have a note in my guide book that one mile took me over two hours to hike. I feared I had a serious knee injury because of the intense pain, MCL or ACL, and I started seeing surgery as my ticket out. All of that led to a tough conversation and dose of reality in the main room of ToG but also a dominant performance in a game of Scrabble with @zeusthegreat7 @shutterbum and Purple Haze(?) #appalachiantrail #atclassof2018 #atclassof2019 #hiking #georgia #at2018 #at2019 #topofgeorgia #hiawassee"

Almost a week in, and I already had it all figured out. When it was going to be sleeting/freezing rain, I would just NOT HIKE, right? Simple. I would plan to be in town at a motel/hostel, or in this case a MUCH nicer place, the Helendorf River Inn! King bed, nice tub, TV, great food within a block with really great live music, a fireplace by which to plan the next few days. Yeeeeaaah no reason to hike in shitty weather. I don't know how I was the first one to figure this out. 🤷‍♂️ *Oh, also, that plan didn't quite work out.

March 7th last year was a Wednesday- a figid, windy, 20 degree day on top of a mountain in Georgia. The kind of cold that aimlessly races through the bare trees and slaps your face so hard you would swear your skin had shattered. I was about to start a thing that I was 99% sure I couldn't do, and I was scared shitless. My first steps on trail were in the wrong direction, and the first week only got worse from there. <br>Multiple times during the next three days, I contemplated how long I had to be out there before quitting wouldn't be an embarrassment. In the meantime, I wished so hard for an injury that would result in an acceptable x-ray.<br><br>I did, however start the project of taking a selfie every day. I did so, because I thought it would be neat to see the changes that would happen during whatever time I would manage to keep going. At the time, I thought the physical change would be the most interesting one. <br>I was wrong.<br><br>But fortunately, it still ended up providing an entertaining and alternative way to view the hike. <br>So here are some of the shots of my mostly dirty and exhausted face during the journey that ended up lasting a little longer than I could have imagined during that first week.

And also the anniversary of the last time I was clean-shaven! February 28th, 2018, was a cool and rainy day down in Georgia. I figured the shit weather was a nice way to put me in my place right from the start. Hiking 2,200 miles was going to be no easy feat. Luckily I was accompanied by my best friend, @nature_trips_mike who ended up hiking the first two weeks with me. And special thanks to @yoyomeow for dropping us off at the trailhead.<br>⛰<br>That first day was a long climb up the beautifully wet Amicalola Falls and a long trudge through muddy, mountainous terrain before we even made it to Springer Mountain, the official start of the trail. That 8.8 miles of approach trail was hard work and I developed my first blisters. Upon arrival at the official trailhead, we were wet and cold but pushed on ahead for nearly 3 mile before settling in at a crowded shelter.<br>⛺️<br>It was an exciting time. Other hikers asked if we we were thru-hikers and I could only reply, “that’s the plan.” I had no idea if I’d make it two weeks, let alone 4+ months on the trail.

It weighs a mere ounce and can absorb 8 times its weight. Highly recommend to this year’s thruhikers and anyone going out for longer than a day hike. I used this towel as a washcloth with Dr. Bronner’s peppermint soap often for an outdoor bath, as a washcloth at hostels when one wasn’t provided, to wipe off frost and excess moisture from my tent in the mornings, as a cold compress dipped in spring water, as a warm compress and face wipe after dipped in hot water, to wipe my pot and spoon, to mop up rain that got in my tent on a few occasions😬, to clean off my glasses as contacts weren’t working for me anymore.

I sat down to meditate before work and this experience flooded my thoughts. I fought to quiet the mind but gave up and released to memories of my thru hike. *<br>Post trail life was hard for me and still is to this day. After returning home I tried to let go of Throwdown, while ignoring the impact it had on Kelly. I negated the experience in my head and what once was viewed as an accomplishment, I had changed to a waste of time. *<br>This morning though, I didn't focus on the negatives. The flashbacks brought up were those where I was laughing instead of crying. Where small acts of kindness meant the world. Where I fell in love. And lastly, where I finished something I didn't think possible. *<br>For that I am grateful. *<br>1. Clingmans Dome - where I got my trailname after throwing my pack down to sprint up that platform for a sunrise picture.<br>2. Snowbird Mountain after fresh snow - epic trail magic followed that day (thanks Waynesboro youth and Bloodhound!)<br>3. Big Bald - One of my favorite southern views of the Blue Ridge<br>4. Shenandoah NP - I roadwalked instead of the trail because I wanted an unobstructed view of the sunrise (and my feet hurt)<br>5. 35 mile day - I pushed myself through pouring rain, across 1000 mi., through the roller coaster, on my own. Still proud.<br>6. First/only night camping alone - stalked by a feisty porcupine and didn't sleep at all.<br>7. Probably Vermud - plentiful water, muddy trails<br>8. Dirty, bloody, bruised, and the most carefree I've been- Spontaneous moments crossing into Maine. Smiles not the miles.<br>9. Mahoosuc notch - the frustration came when I realized I was only halfway done after. The arm was the kicker. <br>10. Finish line 'beer' - I still feel numb in this moment. I was nervous and such a downer that day hiking up Katahdin. Everything I'd known was ending, these were moments I would never experience again. I just wanted to stop and be there for just a bit longer. *<br>#thruhiking #thruhiker #thruhike #appalachiantrail #Atthruhike #atclassof2018 #hiking #longdistancehiking #katahdin #mahoosucnotch #clingmansdome #georgiatomaine #memories"

I ate ALL the foods and drank and the boozes. It’s supposed to be a 1 night max at the hiker center which is in a church’s basement  but the guy in charge was so nice to let us stay two nights. Even made it over to the next town via Uber to indulge in the BEST Greek food of my entire life and a wine tasting. Seriously I would drive all the way back there just for a shawarma gyro!

This was taken on day 12, the day we took Poet's last shuttle back to the trail after staying at Shaw's in Monson, our first hiker hostel, and our first rather jolting dive into civilization since starting the trail. It was wild being around so many other hikers at once. A few of them I had already met a few times on trail, like Effram/Captain 'Murica on my right. Many people I was just meeting for the first time, like the brothers Double Up and Barbosa (later known as Rerun), who I would end up seeing several times after that. They are both so kind and generous and lighthearted. Although Double Up had to get off trail, I always enjoyed bumping into Rerun, usually at least every couple of weeks all the way down to the end of part A of my journey. That morning at Shaw's was when I first met two different people who would later become very important to me - Rhody (@reyem_ellie ) and Firesale - though our connection that day was brief and I wouldn't see either one for a couple of weeks. It was also the last time I saw some people who had been important to me in the 100 mile wilderness. The trail has such an interesting way of bringing people together. You really never know who is going to play a consistent or long lasting role in your journey, but I am so grateful for all of the people I met. Even with those who I didn't hike with much or see very many times, I can't imagine not having every single one of them in my story. <br>I still had no idea what I was getting into at that point, but boy was I glad to be getting into it. <br>#appalachiantrail #at2018 #sobo #atclassof2018 #shaws #shawshikerhostel #monson #throwback"

I’ve been SO many places, met so many people from all walks of life, and have seen so many incredible things. I’m truly thankful for the opportunity and experiences had this past year.  There were many downs, hardships, struggles, and tears. However, there was a lot (and I mean A LOT!) of personal growth. Confidence gained,  a shift in perspective, self love, AND I got to see what I’m really made of. Not to mention, I’ve seen and lived some of the most beautiful, amazing, and untouched places east of the Mississippi. I was able to have more quality time with nature in those 9 months than some people will get in their lifetime. For that, I am also grateful. Special thanks to all the trail angels and supporters out there. You make the trail an even special-er (😋) place.

Jogging around shelters while eating breakfast because it was too cold to stand still. Zipping my water bottle and filter inside of my fleece while hiking so they wouldn't freeze. Periodically kicking ice balls out of the bottoms of my pants and banging my trekking poles on trees to get the ice off the tips. Cramming 20+ people into a shelter made for 10 because it was too dangerous to make anyone sleep outside.<br>*<br>Even with all of that misery... I STILL miss the trail (though not all of it. 😂 I.E. the day this pic was taken). I have settled back into ""regular life"". Working 40 hours a week and spending my day off catching up on errands and cleaning. Visiting Skywater on weekends I have off ❤️. I try to get a hike in with my family's dog when I can and draw, color, or read when I have some downtime... But I miss the freedom, the people, the mountains, the forests. Some days I breeze through, happy with regular old life and helping customers at a job I love... Then some days, like today... The grief of missing the trail feels like I'm grieving the loss of a  person who was my best friend for years. And I guess that feeling isn't too far fetched. Planning for that trail for 2 years prior to heading out, it meant everything to me, and now it's over. But new adventures are always around the corner. 2019 will bring so many new and exciting things I can't wait to share about... but the AT will continue to feel like a long lost love I will continue to long for for many days to come. <br>Xoxo<br>Blade. ❤️"

It was one of those mornings where I did everything I could while still in my sleeping bag (ate breakfast, changed clothes, packed up everything I could, etc). We typically camp in our tents but the area surrounding this shelter was a total swamp! PLUS, this thing was such an upgrade from all the basic shelters. It even had a built in bench which really was nice to have to get organized on and to prop up against before bed😃 I remember feeling like I could feel heat rising from somewhere when I was sitting on the bench. I remember drinking whiskey tea down at the picnic table. I was having a very nice and relaxing evening looking up at the stars until I heard a noise and saw a pair of eyes in the distance👀😳 I then hightailed it for the shelter where I found that moonpie had hung up her rainfly in the entry way to try to keep some of the heat in.

We dusted off the sign and all celebrated with peak treats! It took us exactly 5 months to walk from Maine to Georgia. With the stormy weather we knew no one could pick us up at the parking lot around the top, so we started the 8.8 descent on the Approach Trail. Crazy amounts of downed trees and ice were everywhere which made for slow & scary hiking. The 4 of us fell a combined 10 times just on the Approach Trail 😂 We eventually made it to the top of the falls where we were supposed to say goodbye to @kmtake.a.hike but then our ride (thanks @lewallen.mj 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻) showed up and we all got to head to Atlanta together! We all went out to dinner with Mike & a couple of his awesome friends! If it wasn’t trail magic enough to have a friend drive all the way to Amiciola Falls to get us & let us crash at his apt, one of his friends bought our dinners.

I was challenged every day, I cried buckets, I bled, I bruised, I limped. My feet will never be the same (still limping - thanks, Pennsylvannia). But I grew. I felt deeply. And I am so, so grateful for the joy and peace of the trail. What a profound pleasure to be able to live a dream, even if only for a little while. <br>I am still adjusting to having to be off trail - I knew it would be tricky no matter what, but it's extra difficult to adjust to since I haven't actually finished yet.

Future thru hikers, if you do not stay here when you get to NJ you are doing yourself a disservice. VERY reasonably priced esp being that we aren’t (ain’t😜) in the south anymore at this point. Cozy bunks. Clean. Hot shower. AND you get a HOME COOKED breakfast on the house. This is no continental breakfast. I’m talking eggs cooked to order, bacon, juice, coffee,and the best breakfast potatoes. So crispy on the outside and soft on the inside 🤤🤤🤤 On top of it all Mosey is super sweet and definitely strives to go above and beyond to help hikers on her own personal time and even on her own dime at times.  She took us into town to pick up take out and for beer and wine 🙌🏼 She slack packed us and even did our laundry for us 😭😭😭 .<br>.<br>.<br> #appalachiantrail2018 #nobothruhike #atthruhiker #atthruhike2018 #hikertrash #hikertrashforlife #longdistancehiking #womenwhohike #backpackingculture #hiking #walkabout  #iquit #iquitmyjob #hiking #hikingculture #backpacking #backpacker #appalachiantrials #nobo2018 #georgiatomaine  #norainnomaine #whiteblaze #lifechanging #doepicshit #atclassof2018 #cantstopwontstop #thankful #mosey"

So, I pointed my little icon in the direction of the shelter and Started to walk that way. I got to a point where I could smell something tasty and thought “gosh that smells so good.” It was then i realized that it had to be Moonpie’s (my hiking partner) food cooking 😃🤞🏼. This was only after I walked around in circles for a bit of course. I called out to her and she called out back to me and I was able to follow her voice and come up from the hill behind the shelter. whoops 😁😇 it poured from the time I got to the shelter that night through the next day.

The miles have been walked, the views admired, and new friendships made but I still can't seem to put the right words to how it all really feels. I'll have nothing but fond memories of this trail and I'm so thankful for the whole experience. Thankful to my family and friends for giving me all the support (and then some!) from back home. Thankful for the thousands of volunteers that maintain and protect this trail each year because without them, this journey would never have been possible. Thankful for all of the unbelievable trail angels along the way offering food, sodas, rides into town, and whatever hospitality/support they could-they truly restored my faith in humanity. Thankful for all of the wonderful hikers I met along the way, whether it was just a passing conversation or whether we walked for days or weeks together-you were the people that helped keep me sane on my down days and reminded me that we're all in this journey together. The community that surrounds this trail are truly some of the most unique and special people who would give the coat off their back before you could even ask for it. In today's fast paced and competitive society, these people are usually hard to come by but the trail seems to attract them all to one place. These people are what really make this trail more than just about the miles, and more about the whole experience. It's not about hiking the miles just to say I did it, it was about enjoying the ride along the way and this was probably the most valuable life lesson I could've learned from the trail. To always remember to have goals and work towards them but never forget to enjoy the journey along the way. Life may not be so simple as following white blazes all day to an end goal but the trail taught me that step by step, even the most impossible challenges become possible as long as you keep making daily strides towards them and for that I'm forever grateful #hikeyourownhike #experiencesnotthings #thankful #appalachiantrail #georgiatomaine #atclassof2018 #flipflop #thruhike #thruhiker #pennslyvania #thetrek #trektheAT #optoutside"

So, I pointed my little icon in the direction of the shelter and Started to walk that way. I got to a point where I could smell something tasty and thought “gosh that smells so good.” It was then i realized that it had to be Moonpie’s (my hiking partner) food cooking 😃🤞🏼. This was only after I walked around in circles for a bit of course. I called out to her and she called out back to me and I was able to follow her voice and come up from the hill behind the shelter. whoops 😁😇 it poured from the time I got to the shelter that night through the next day.

I totally shirked all my obligations for the afternoon, put my phone on airplane mode, and went in search of some closer shots of the white capped mountains I saw while driving west across central Maine. While I didn’t exactly find my shot, I did semi-accidentally find the AT. <br>Whenever I get near this trail now I can feel it in my bones. I start recognizing where I’m at and right about that time I’ll see a sign for my beloved trail. Today was no different, and I hit the parking lot in Caratunk, jumped out, and walked down the trail in a light rain. What was different about today is today I realized how much I miss hiking being my day to day. I miss just walking through the woods with my friends, and our freedom. I miss looking at the numbers on these little signs and knowing that was all I had to worry about that day. I miss the smell of the woods and the cool air on my face. I miss the sound of fresh water running, and the silence of a clear night. Hell, right now, I even miss the rain.<br>#ATblues#takemeback#atthruhike2018#atclassof2018#maineoutdoors"

Alright people. I've tried to share most of the major highs and lows of this journey with you, and I'd be remiss to skip over this low. <br>I've been struggling a lot lately - the isolation out here in the arena has been a challenge sometimes, but after being out here for so long (almost 5 months now) and starting to throw in extra coldness and darkness - well, it hasn't been a picnic. I still really enjoy the hiking part of it despite my limping, but camping alone in the cold and dark, when I could go home and just finish this when it's warmer has been weighing on me. A couple days ago, I revised my plan to simply try to make it to Hot Springs before Thanksgiving and then decide from there whether to break til spring. At first I felt a lot of peace about that, but after getting back on trail... well, let's just say Hot Springs feels really far away. The thing about thruhiking is that you always have to be ready to revise your plans. It's hard, though, because it's not just a plan, it's a dream, and it can hurt to change a dream. Anyway, still on trail at least until Friday. Hoping I'll have the mental and emotional strength to make it at least past the state line so that I'll have finished Virginia, and maybe I'll make it to Hot Springs this season after all, but if I'm crying myself to sleep too often I'm gonna have to call it. Reminding myself that this is all just part of the story - maybe not quite the story I was trying to cultivate, but still one I'm glad to be in. <br>Also, to be clear, no matter what happens I have every intention of finishing before June 10th so that I'll still technically be a thru hiker. <br>#thisisavoluntaryexperience #appalachiantrail #atclassof2018 #at2018 #sobo #thruhikerthoughts"

I started the trail, like most aspiring thru-hikers, alone. I knew no one who was going to be hiking the trail either. But you are never truly alone (unless you want to be) on the trail. I found that most of the time I prefer to hike throughout the day by myself but at the same time I’m a fairly social person and enjoy having lunch with friends, sharing beautiful views and setting up camp together. The entire trail I spent only 5 nights alone. I hiked portions with all guys, all girls, my best friend on trail, as a third wheel, with friends that came to visit, with strangers who turned into friends, with my parents, with friends who were half my age or I half their age, and every combination of the above. If you are considering hiking the AT and are nervous about going alone, don’t worry, you will soon meet some of the best and most interesting people in the world! •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••<br>#appalachiantrail #thruhiking #hikertrash #friendswhohike #optoutside #hiking #at2018 #atclassof2018 #friends #georgiatomaine #hikemoreworryless #justkeephiking"

We passed him as he was pulling out equipment at one of the road crossings in SNP to do some trail maintenance. He gave us oranges & snickers and we had a nice conversation. Fast forward through the day and we’re trying to hitch into town. Low & behold he comes driving up. He shuttles us all around to get gear, resupply, and a shipped in package. Convenience is something you give up when you go to the trail so it’s always nice to meet people who give it back to you in some way. &His attitude was so great! Being a recipient many times of trail magic he talked of an equilibrium - he was ‘paying it forward’ because he couldn’t pay it back. For him to receive his trail magic while he was a hiker, he also had to give it out. Wise words from an elder gentleman with a great spirit! Thanks Mark Trail for your kindness! (QuickFix was dropped off at the library to deal with his bum phone when we took this pic... no he hasn’t gotten lost of left behind) 💕🙌🏻🌲 #at2018 #atclassof2018 #appalachiantrail #appalachiantrail2018 #aspiringthruhiker #thruhiker #thetrek #optoutside #adventurousals #forceofnature #backpacking  #hikertrash #trektheat #mtnchicksdoitbetter #whyihike #likeamountaingirl #idhikethatcrew #keepnaturewild #withguthooks #guthookguides #atlasguides #wekeepyououtdoors #SOBO #everytrailconnects #bpmag #takemebackpacking #trailchat #Lifebeyond9to5"

On 10/17/18, five days before I turn 30, I summited with joyous, shocked tears streaming down my face. Over these past 5 months I learned more than I expected about myself; I encouraged myself to let go of control and to keep saying yes to new things even if they may look scary at first. I’ve met amazing people along the way; folks who I have such a bond with that they will always be my family. I never gave up on those I was walking for; throughout all the tears, the slips and falls, the infection, the thunderstorms and freezing rain, the sleepless nights and the dragging mornings, there was always a reason to keep going. This trip has been one hell of an amazing ride, one I’m truly grateful to have experienced. <br>Cancer Research fundraiser update: I raised $4,138.00, more than I expected to raise for my cause, which is truly amazing! When I summited Katahdin I carried everyone’s name with me: Anne, Susanna, Joan, Evan, Gary, Harold, Andrew, Pano, Mary Lee, Arlett, Carolyn, Barbara, Nancy and Donna. Plus all those who are fighting or have fought cancer. Those folks are the real heroes. It’s been an honor to walk over trail for them. <br>Thank you over and over for all the support, hugs, well wishes, and love before, during and after this journey. It’s truly meant the world to me! ♥️Fozzie Bear<br>-<br>-<br>#baxterstatepark #fallinmaine #mountkatahdin #homeisinthewoods #happiness #fortheloveofhiking #georgiatomaine #whiteblazes #thruhike #appalachiantrail2018 #atclassof2018 #hikingadventures #hikingforcancerresearch #hikeforacause #womanwhoexplore #womanwhohike #hikeyourownhike #optoutside #fozziehitsthetrail"

I lost count of how many injuries, 30 lbs lighter than when I started and I have now fungus growing under both big toe nails. <br>Yesterday I summited Mount Katahdin in Baxter park, ME. The northern terminus of the Appalachian trail, it was not how I had envisioned it throughout the last couple of months, not at all. <br>The forecast was unfavorable to say the least: snow showers, high winds, freezing temperatures but the next day was gonna be worse or so they predicted.<br>The climb itself was not the hardest we've done but in these conditions it certainly was tricky and dangerous as you could easily lose track of the trail and your bearings, having left some of our gear at the ranger station it made the thought of getting lost very unnerving. <br>Getting closer now,  higher and in a blizzard,  we had come too far and walked too long to turn back now! And so, we pressed on and made sure to leave a trace using pine needles, and scraping snow off the cairns so we could find our way back, and then after another mile, a familiar shape, one I have seen many times before in pictures, was this it? Could it be? Really?? Yes!!!! We had made it!! The feelings are very hard to describe there were too many all at once, exhilaration and joy mostly but also a sense of urgency as we were losing daylight and still had to climb back down this mountain.<br>Funny how things unfold sometimes and turn out to be exactly what needed to happen at that point in time. I will be catching the sunrise up there someday but for now this was the perfect ending and so much more than I could have ever imagined. @anna.k.t.b #appalachiantrail2018 #bonappetitfromtheAT #atclassof2018 #atthruhike"

He’s totally fine though, just a little case of some bacterial eye thing. 🤷🏽‍♀️ Got a yummy bbq dinner before we headed back to the trail - can anybody guess what plate isn’t the thru hiker? 😛 WOOOAAAHHHHH WE’RE HALFWAY THERE 🙌🏻👣 #at2018 #atclassof2018 #appalachiantrail #appalachiantrail2018 #aspiringthruhiker #thruhiker #thetrek #optoutside #adventurousals #forceofnature #backpacking  #hikertrash #trektheat #mtnchicksdoitbetter #whyihike #likeamountaingirl #idhikethatcrew #keepnaturewild #withguthooks #guthookguides #atlasguides #wekeepyououtdoors #SOBO #everytrailconnects #bpmag #takemebackpacking #trailchat #Lifebeyond9to5"

No words will ever be able to fully describe how this moment felt after spending the last half year living in the woods and walking towards this place. I’m still trying to wrap my head around the fact that I won’t be carrying all my belongings, my home, on my back anymore. That I won’t have to wake up in the morning, rain or shine, and walk north. I have enjoyed walking in the wild in solitude, exploring rural America with my trail friends, and sitting around campfires at night talking about nothing. It has truly been a wondrous experience! Not really sure what to do now that I don’t have to wear the same outfit every day and eat protein bars for every meal, but I can’t wait for the next adventure to come. .⠀<br>.⠀<br>Thank you to everyone that has followed and supported my journey here, my amazing parents, my friends and family back home, all the trail angels that showed me so much kindness, everyone who has helped me raise funds for Hike4MentalHealth, the amazing @thruhikesyndicate sponsors, and last but not least my fellow hikers without which I would never have made it to Katahdin. ⠀<br>14 states, 2,190.9 miles* ✌, Pika "" #withguthook ⠀<br>•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••⠀<br>#appalachiantrail #georgiatomaine #climbmountainsnotladders #somanyfeels #muchwow  #guthookguides #atnobo #hiking #atclassof2018 #hikemoreworryless #thruhiking #thruhikesyndicate #hike *I have 13ish miles to do in Virginia on my way home before I can officially call myself a thru-hiker!

Specifically, I'm making comics throughout my hike to fund the whole adventure. My usual process is to wait until I have five ready, post them all on my patreon page, and then share two publicly on my art Insta, @rotucomics . Additionally, I've started a super gratifying inktober project which I am sharing allllll of for free on that same insta, if you want to follow along. Art has been such an integral part of my journey, and I am so grateful that it has allowed me to go on this trip at all, and for the focus and connections it has provided. <br>Make art, peeps. <br>#appalachiantrail #comicshikes #at2018 #atclassof2018 #artistadventures #inktober"

Forgot my only mean of shelter (my tarp) while in Lincoln and realized half way up the mountain, too late to go back. Had to do some work for stay at some of the huts because of it and the rain moving in made it impossible to camp without a tarp, scrubbed cooking range and other kitchen equipment for a night in, twice! But all this made this crossing even more rewarding and unforgettable. Being above tree line and in the alpine reminded me of home a little, the views of the mountains going for miles, feeling very small and yet very proud and tall when looking back at where you had come from and what you've just accomplished.

I’ve been hiking with many in mind and I plan to dedicate these mountains to them. Nano was a woman I unfortunately never got to meet because she lost her long battle to ovarian cancer when I was an infant. My father would tell me stories of how wonderful she was and I always wanted to do something in her memory. Her soul is something I’m honored to carry throughout this entire hike. “About 22,240 women will receive a new diagnosis of ovarian cancer. About 14,070 women will die from ovarian cancer. About 1 in 78 are at risk and 1 in 108 will die from ovarian cancer.” #newhampshire #homeisinthewoods #happiness #fortheloveofhiking #georgiatomaine #whiteblazes #thruhike #appalachiantrail2018 #atclassof2018 #hikingadventures #hikingforcancerresearch #hikeforacause #womanwhoexplore #womanwhohike #hikeyourownhike #optoutside #fozziehitsthetrail"

On the other hand, I'm always a little sad to see summer go; especially one as memorable as this. The first day of summer this year I spent hiking naked through the White Mountains of New Hampshire and yesterday on the last day of it, I went skinny dipping in a Virginia creek. And I've had all sorts of other crazy adventures in between. This summer I feel like I really lived instead of just existing. Every day had a goal and purpose to it while still having so much freedom to explore new places and meet new people along the way.

Gregory Optic 48l<br>.<br>Here is the first Gregory Optic 48 to reach Katahdin.  I climbed up Cathedral and down Hamelin and there were no blemishes to be found on this pack.  I was also within the recommended weight so there were no extra stressing on the belt and shoulder pads.  On the way down we were forced to slide down on our bums but the way the pack sits, even sitting down, it will not touch the ground.  The rocks on Katahdin are very coral like and are unforgiving as my legs can attest too.  So all the stories you hear how fragile these new ultralight pack are..... but if you handle with care, the ultralight packs will do well.  My 3 new hiking friends that day were witness to how well this pack performed.  Well done Gregory on a very well designed comfortable pack with a respectable 2.3 pounds.  The review will be completed in a couple of weeks on both the 58 and 48 that have been field tested under very difficult conditions.<br>.<br>If you have any new packs and would like them to be tested out in the difficult Canadian hiking trails, let me know.  I have hiking friends (male and female) that would love to help me test them out too.<br>.<br>#trail #appalachiantrail #at2018 #ATclassof2018<br>#thetrailspeaks #gregorytribe #campingdonelight #keepthedreameralive #goodtimesoutside<br>#balanceofnature #moments #sawyer<br>#adventure #outdoors #backpacker #thruhike #granitegear <br>#sectionhike #dayhike #thetrek<br>#gregorypacks #exploreclub<br>#gregorypackseu #hyperlitemountaingear #livetheadventure #xtcoutdoorlife #zpacks"

Had a great couple of nights chatting to rangers and getting to know about their culture.  Next day went up Cathedral and OMG what a hike that was.  The side bar was an easy 70% climb up which took 3 hours with lots of breaks. .<br>While on top, I saw Redbush and Seven who I haven’t seen since Virginia.  Also a bunch of redhead ladies celebrating a birthday.<br>.<br>On our return, our group of 4 split with 2 going down via saddle and myself and Phil  crossing over Saddle to hike the Hamelin Trail.  We did not know what to expect but it was not as difficult as we were fearing and the ridge walk was interesting.  Tons of side views of Knife, Cathedral, Saddle and the now closed Dudley Trail.  It took us 3 hours to get back to Chimney pond.<br>.<br>My problem that day is I forget all my food for the climb so that hurt me fir that day and not being able to safety hike the next day.  Fortunately the group helped out with their own rations.<br>.<br>Summary is bring work gloves, long pants, 4 litres of water, snacks and various other energy items.

For two months we hiked, laughed, cried, sweat, bled, hugged, hammocked, danced, summited, wept, rejoiced, and sang together. But I suppose that's pretty much what we normally do. Thanks for singing with me through dark nights, staying by my side when I got food poisoning, helping me with water crossings, and being patient with my impatience. Thanks for making life so much richer and warmer and groovier. Thanks for still doing so much to get me through this even while we're apart.

Unfortunately, we've run out of time and won't be able to complete our thru hike. The Whites slowed us down too much and the stress of trying to make our deadline was starting to make our days more miserable than fun. We've spent the last week discussing our options and decided to end our adventure on a high note, so Mt. Washington was our last mountain on the AT. We hitch hiked into Maine hoping to summit Katahdin tomorrow with our trail legs, but due to a pinched nerve in my neck, we won't be attempting it. This adventure has been everything we ever hoped it would be, and more. We met amazing people, made great friends and got to explore some beautiful and interesting places.

Some may be offended who I have no intention of offending. (Apologies) But, I have come from a dark place. I wasn’t sure if I would finish this trail. I began with the mantra “I will finish or it will finish me.” Depression and suicide, I feel are not spoken of enough. I have been there longer than I truly realized and I was closer to the end than I would ever admit. I used alcohol as a slow attempt at that poor solution... I post this to tell friends and family that I’m not giving up. I’m fighting the good fight. I’m strong enough to be weak and to live my life with love and kindness. I’m no longer afraid to be guided by my heart and silence my fearful mind. This goes out to the “I can’t” in me and the “you can’t” that comes at me. This is a thank you to all my friends and family and all those who have inspired and who I’ve idolized. As I sat up there a week ago trying to control my weeping, thankful for being led out of the darkness and never fading to black, I couldn’t help but think of one of my idols, the man in black—This is my best Johnny Cash!

Crossed into Vermont today! This morning we walked through Hanover (the AT goes through town, even passes a Starbucks), had a giant breakfast at Lou's, then passed into Vermont. We found some trail magic at a house along the trail, and I had my first ever Mountain Dew.

It feels more like that the farther away I drive.<br><br>But I also realize that the version of myself heading home is now necessarily comprised of some of the best parts of the people I met on trail, and that's a pretty comforting thought. I don't believe it's possible to spend that kind of time on the trail and experience the absolute best that humanity has to offer and still finish unchanged. <br>So let's talk a little bit about the group that changed me the most... Jukebox (Amy)- JB was the toughest person I met on the trail. Since mile 533 (Marion, VA), she hiked in a group of three, eventually four dudes who treated her like one of the guys. She held her own and dished it out just like the rest of us. I heard her stand up for what she believed in during more than a couple heated debates. Most importantly, she was the only one who TOTALLY bought in to my mission of petting EVERY single dog we met on trail. She's surrounded by a great family and amazing friends, many of whom I was lucky enough to meet as we made our way thru New England. The AT wasn't her first time powering across the map. A couple years ago, she bicycled across the country from east to west. Jukebox used this summer to ""relax"", hiking over 2,100 miles thru every type of weather and terrain before she moves from Maine to Washington to persue her PHD in oceanography. Having witnessed how strong and bright Jukebox is over the last five months, it's obvious to me that she's going to just annihilate the next few years of schooling as she continues to grow and succeed.<br><br>Duke (Dylan)- Duke was the strongest hiker in our group. He was hilarious, got annoyed with us, spoke directly, and was a beast on the trail. Duke had to speed ahead of us toward the end because of some logistics with his finishing date. He could have... #appalachiantrail #atclassof2018 #patontheat #nobo #katahdin #thruhike #hiking #nature"

Instead of gazing at her from every trailside viewpoint I chose to swim at her feet in nearly every pond and creek, and even a few waterfalls. <br>It isn’t the destination I sought, in this case the summit of Mt Katahdin, but rather the sitting in silence with the culmination of a summers long journey of emotional and spiritual growth for a few extra fleeting moments before ascending to a peak 13 States and some 2190.9 trail miles away from Springer Mountain, the one descended at the start of this journey back at Amicalola Falls in Georgia 23 April. <br>As I write this I am filled with a whirlwind of emotions, some of which I cannot even begin to express... but I can share with you this... It was always about the journey... and never about the destination... I am happy. Both deeply, and profoundly. “Travel isn’t always pretty. It isn’t always comfortable. Sometimes it hurts.

We have walked through snow, rain, sleet, flooding, record-breaking heat, and fires and we did every step together. <br>We were told by park officials that our 2-year-old, Rainier, would not be able to go past treeline and finish the last mile to the summit. Numerous friends and hikers have offered to watch him so the rest of the family could go up to the sign but after a family meeting, we unanimously decided that it didn't feel right to leave anyone behind. We have traveled every step of the trail that was legally available to our family so this is our summit. It feels good to be done.

And while that might’ve been a survival technique in my past, worrying incessantly doesn’t serve me now. I’m not at war, and when I live by a crystal ball I most often eat glass. Be present and grateful that I’m in the safest place and time of my life. It’s okay, Inner Child, I’m an adult now and it’s time for you to come out and freely play.<br>.<br>And many problems aren’t even mine. I mean, if I don’t worry about them or stress to plan for them, then they’ll never get done and I’ll have to contend with them later. It’s easier for me to just take ‘care’ of it, right? Wrong. I’m not a mother. We’re all big girls and boys here. My self-importance arises from within, not through the validation of doing someone else’s tasks that they could’ve done perfectly well (or not) by their own damn selves. Live and let live. Be generous, not an enabling martyr. Secure my own oxygen mask first, look over and breathe well knowing that most everyone around me are more than capable of securing their own, too. Have faith in both myself and the company I keep. Most aren’t dumbasses and deserve more credit.<br>.<br>Most importantly, welcome. Welcome to heaven. Population: nearly everyone. It’s an amazing time to be alive. It’s an amazing world to be a citizen. It’s freakin heaven. Wake up to its beauty. Stop finding sadistic comfort in “problems.” The joys of the world are everywhere, I just have to pick my head up and open my eyes.<br>.<br>Problems are only problems when I make them problems.

The wildcat peaks proceeded to play a little game of cat and mouse with me, and I emerged a wet, tired, bruised and beaten little mousey—but I survived to hike another day. Between the facts that the trail was essentially a waterfall due to the copious rainfall, the difficult climbs,  and dangerous descents, this was the hardest day on trail for me so far. Six miles in six hours was demoralizing.

Yesterday, after laundry and showers, we went to the ER in Rutland. @the_tramp_ has been falling apart the last couple of days on Trail and we were worried it might be more serious than dehydration. They ran some tests and determined he was very dehydrated, to the point that his muscles were starting to break down; however, the levels were still very low so there should be no further issue. They also ran a blood panel for various tick borne illnesses, which we are waiting on results for. ••<br>On the bright side, Bonnie Blue is not only our home, but also our food retrieval machine!

He hiked with us for one day, but if course we had the worst rain and rocks combined. So we got another hotel to dry out. <br>Thank you, thank you so much Mr. No Mercy. <br>Richard and Betsy invited us into their home. The offered a steak dinner and laundry (and even showers and beds) We took them up on the dinner and laundry. The meal consisted of hot dogs, pickles, guacamole, and drinks for appetizers. There was steak, chicken, salmon, sweet corn (the best sweet corn I have ever had without butter or salt even!), potatoes, broccoli, watermelon, cookies, candy bars,  and 3 different kinds of pie.

While I’ve seen a couple, I’ve spent that majority of my hiking time emphasizing each step with a curse, each gnat swat with a Tarzanic outcry, each bite with a nauseated snarl, each nighttime tick check with a “wtf am I doing out here,” each whiff of myself with a gag, etc., etc. you get the idea. I’m beyond frustrated.<br>.<br>That is until recently.<br>.<br>I asked a friend for some advice on staying positive and motivated. Expecting some tactical, easily executable tips, I confessed my situation. To my dismay, yet also to my salvation, he gave me a list of thoughtful solutions around a theme of mindfulness, reflection, and gratitude. He reminded me that I’m one of the most privileged people on earth. He held a mirror up to my petulance. “The struggle ends when the gratitude begins.” Find something, anything, to be grateful for, and watch your mood lift. Solid footstep? Thanks! Cooling rain that calms the bugs? Hallelujah! Hot, caffeinated instant coffee? I LOVE it - thank you, Folgers!<br>.<br>I’ve felt like a woo-woo loving peace warrior of late, expressing gratitude for the tiniest of things, but it’s sincerely been a trip saving activity. While I still drop several F-bombs throughout the day and may still condemn the entire population of mosquitoes to hell on an hourly basis, my perspective has made a 180-degree turn all thanks to a simple gratitude practice.<br>.<br>We all say our adventures teach us things to implement back in our “real” lives. While I wish I could’ve stayed candy and nuts this whole trip, it’s both unrealistic and wouldn’t have provided this opportunity to show me the power of gratitude. It’s profound. And it just might have been my lifeline.<br>.<br>Thanks, life, your roller coaster really is a blast and undoubtedly the best thing that we all have. #at2018 #thruhike #atthruhike2018 #atthruhike #hikertrash #girlswhohike #atclassof2018 .<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#womenwhoexplore #thetrek #womenwhohike #hikinglovers #trailrunnergirl #hikethetrek #georgiatomaine #hikethetrail #ultralightbackpacking #camperlife #backpackinggirl"

We had hoped for bigger miles in order to have a short hike into Fort Montgomery tomorrow but stopped short of our goal. (It takes a good half day to do chores so our tendency is to push the day before for a shorter walk in on town day. <br>Despite the difficulty of the day, two encouraging things happened.  1) we had good weather and cache’s of water by road crossings.  This section is completely dry except for black water streams so we really appreciate the trail angels who do this for us.  2) we ran into a hiker feed at the end of the day hosted by the class of ‘98 as a 20 year reunion!  We each had a hot dog and two burgers before and Flex packed out a muffin for the mornings before hiking out to find a spot for the night.  While at the feed we ran into the trail maintainer of this section who told us it gets better in NY (after bear mountain).

Wet rock and dry rock. Jagged angled rock. Pebbles, boulders, and everything between. Miles and miles of dry, hot rock. And so as your people would mine this land so did Your land mine my spirit. Not for precious metals but for untapped reserves of will. The precious material smelted by your unrelenting sun. And please know that where you dug, where you took something from me, will not be left a scar. The abandoned quarry in me will be filled much like your beautiful lakes. Cool, deep, refreshing.

Guide?! These watermarks are placed in the areas that have previously been known for high bear activity. We will be updating this every year based on the reports we get regarding bear activity on the Trail. It is important to stay “bear aware” along the whole trail, but these bear watermarks will serve as an additional warning in certain areas. <br>Bears are becoming increasingly more active around shelter sites on the trail. Bear canisters are recommended as the best method of keeping bears and hikers safe. When bear bags are used they should be hung 12 feet from the ground, 6 feet from the trunk, and 6 feet from the limb that they hang on. Please make use of bear cables and bear boxes if they are provided on site.

When I started planning this trip, I circled mile 1704 as a distant, seemingly unreachable number, but a number that I DID think about. 1704 (McMinn St.) is a significant number in our household, used to reference family, especially those who are no longer here, as it was the address where mom grew up and where grandma lived since before us kids were born. <br>The closer I got to mile 1704, the more I wished I wasn't about to pass it because of so many memories rushing back, associated with the number, thereby making it extremely difficult to focus on hiking. <br>During the climb just before mile 1704, one of the bigger ones so far- Killington Peak, Vermont- I realized that at some point during the last 1700 miles I changed from the guy others asked if ""Everything ok? Gonna make it?"" to the guy congratulating a couple struggling as I passed by with ""Great job, almost there."" I don't know exactly when that change happened, but I'm proud that it did. And that realization today was what I needed to push past mile 1704, remembering all the happy memories associated with McMinn St (1702 included), and all those who passed thru there. So, I turned up the music and kept stepping north en route to the next important number on the way to 2190.9, just this time with a lot of pretty great childhood memories in mind. *guard back in place*<br><br>#patontheat #appalachiantrail #atclassof2018 #aliquippa #grandma #hiking #killington #vermont #emotion"

Normally the trail meanders through what hikers describe as the ""green tunnel"" with the views scattered throughout but up here you can see the trail ahead and the path you've already walked behind. And the feeling that comes from that is something hard to describe..it's so empowering being tired and covered in sweat, looking back knowing you got yourself and your gear up and over one mountain and on to the next. Life's path and the ""mountains"" along the way aren't always as easy to pick out and sometimes you're in the ""green tunnel"" trying to find your way but the journey is really what it's all about, not the destination. Not every path will be the fastest or easiest (especially the AT 😂) and no one's path is set in stone but the reward is the feeling you get knowing you got through it..whatever challenge it was. There's a popular saying out here on the trail, ""Experiences, not things"" and I think this is something a lot of people (myself included) forget from time to time. It's not always about how light your gear is or how many miles you walked that day; it's about enjoying the ride along the way..wherever it may take ya.

Be as I am - a reluctant enthusiast....a part-time crusader, a half-hearted fanatic. Save the other half of yourselves and your lives for pleasure and adventure. It is not enough to fight for the land; it is even more important to enjoy it. While you can. While it’s still here. So get out there and hunt and fish and mess around with your friends, ramble out yonder and explore the forests, climb the mountains, bag the peaks, run the rivers, breathe deep of that yet sweet and lucid air, sit quietly for a while and contemplate the precious stillness, the lovely, mysterious, and awesome space. Enjoy yourselves, keep your brain in your head and your head firmly attached to the body, the body active and alive, and I promise you this much; I promise you this one sweet victory over our enemies, over those desk-bound men and women with their hearts in a safe deposit box, and their eyes hypnotized by desk calculators. I promise you this; You will outlive the bastards.”<br>- Edward Abbey<br>#edwardabbey #getoutthere #theoneswhowalk #athruhiker #atclassof2018 #AT2018 #appalachiantrail #nationalparksusa #nationalparks [Photo: @hikingguygarret ]"

Unfortunately sometimes you can’t prepare yourself for multiple issues to occurs at once; a badly blistered foot, terrifying rain storms, a snapped tent pole and being solo. Mile 500-600 was my hardest stretch yet. I made it through but not everyone can continue on. So non hikers, if your friend, lover, child or parent needs to come off the trail for whatever reason don’t shame them.

It’s always nice to see the sun light through the trees even knowing how hot it will be later in the day.<br>We pushed through a good number of climbs to try and get to a camp store almost 20 miles away before it closed at 6pm.  We would be cutting it close.  About 2 miles before our arrival at the campground, the rain poured down.  We threw on on pack covers and rain gear and still managed to get to the store by 5:30!  The porch to the store was filled with lots of wet and smelly hikers doing the same thing.  One perk about hiking through the SNP is the camp stores and restaurants along the way and every hiker is happy to take advantage of it.  After eating food from the camp store we decided to pay to camp there rather than hike on to a guaranteed crowded shelter or walking even further for a stealth spot.  We fell asleep to the different sounds of babies crying and cars driving by.  We laughed out loud through our tents with our fellow hikers at our questionable decision to stay in a place that had seemed so strange and somewhat annoying.  Thankfully the campground has quiet hours at 10pm and things quieted down.<br>Tomorrow we only have a short morning walk to Big Meadows where we’ve been gifted the opportunity to stay the night!  I’m excited about that and looking forward to eating hot food and all the perks that come with staying in a room with a real bed and a shower!!<br>#appalachiantrail<br>#AT #trektheat #thetrek #hike #takeahike #hiking #thruhike #backpacking #hikertrash #optoutside<br>#mountains #rei #atclassof2018<br>#georgiatomaine<br>#adventure<br>#livingthedream"

The sky was cloudy and I could smell rain in the air.  The cooler temperatures were a welcomed me relief.  This afternoon we passed this cool barn/house.  It makes me wonder what kind of story goes with it.  Not long after that we came to a road with two hostel options within walking distance.  Thunder was rumbling in the distance so we’ve decided to walk to Black Bear Resort and Hostel for a break because their sign said they had food and drinks.  It was a very nice place and the rain began after we got there.  Flex ate a whole frozen pizza and a coke and I had a frozen burger and chocolate milk!  We weighed ourselves there and Flex has lost 20 lbs (not good) and I’ve lost 7lbs. <br>As tempting as it was to stay there, we decided to hike on for 6 more miles to get to the top of the next mountain and make up some of yesterday’s miles.  We pulled out the umbrellas and trekked along.  The umbrellas keep things fairly dry but they limit our sight ahead.  We managed to get down a rocky decent to a waterfall and by the time we started a long climb up the rain stopped!  We were able to put our tent up and eat before the rain started pouring down again!

With three days of food and a bottle of water my pack weighed in around 26 lb and Flex’s around 28 lb.  Later that day we added and extra 2lb (CT) and 4lb (FF) in extra water as according to Guthooks the afternoon lacked water sources. <br>The first good surprise of the day was that the incline going out was not that steep and ran along side a beautiful stream for what seemed to be a couple hours!  The steeper climbs eventually came but only one of three was a miserable  climb, due mostly to dry, rocky, and hot conditions.  It’s amazing what a difference cool breezes make when climbing up.<br>The terrain today was also a constant surprise.  One minute we’re climbing by streams, the next we’re in open grassy balds, and at the end of the day we found ourselves surrounded by groves of pine trees with moss all around. At one point I felt like I was on a Christmas tree farm with small pines lining both sides of the path.<br>Another surprise today was trail magic, once at the bottom of a gap (“Brother Tom” handing out cold lemonade, brownies, and supplying chairs to sit on) and once at the top of Beauty Rest Mountain (“Onesimus” handing out ice cream from his camper as he discussed his philosophy on the end times). It all made for a varied and interesting day!<br>One frustrating part of the day is that we walked by beautiful camp sites all day bit of course we did not much camping options at the end of the day.  I guess that goes with thru-hiking.  I’ve made a mental note to come back to this section some day and just be campers.  We ended up camping at a shelter and I’m simply grateful for a place to lie my head as I’m pretty sleepy.<br>Thankful today for God’s variety in creation and people.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail<br>#AT #trektheat #thetrek #hike #takeahike #hiking #thruhike #backpacking #hikertrash #optoutside<br>#mountains #rei #atclassof2018<br>#georgiatomaine<br>#adventure<br>#livingthedream"

It’s our gift to them. <br>On days like today, the sun is rising to our right, confirming we are heading in the right direction, and we walk leisurely and quietly as our legs stretch back into their now familiar rhythm.

She did me one better brought me a new filter and a bunch of trail magic.  Me and the tramily are super happy eating some fresh fruit and drinking a few beers.  I cannot thank you both enough.

Blessed to wake up this morning to the sounds of birds, that the rain stayed away long enough for me to see Pearisburg, VA from high atop the Pearis Ledges, and just to even be able to turn 29 and feel healthy enough to hike everyday with my tramily ♥️. Last night I was woken up at exactly 11pm and I realized it was an hour before my birthday and I layed on my sleeping pad in Docs Knob shelter and pondered the past year and how much I've grown in just the past 2 months of being out here. 28 was a year of high anxiety and risking it all leaping out into the unknown. I know that 29 will be the year of reaping the benefits of all the risks I took... In fact.... It's already begun. Being able to experience something completely new everyday, whether it's just a new flower I haven't seen, a view from a mountain top, or eating breakfast in a new town before heading back out on the trail... Rewards are ALWAYS worth the risk. Cheers to being 29 and fiiiine 😘 now time for some Cinco de drinko marggggs<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#at2018 #atclassof2018 #thruhike2018 #georgiatomaine2018 #trektheat #thetrek #georgiatomaine #womeninthewild #appalachiantrials #appalachiantrail #womenwhohike #optoutside #rei1440project #backpacking #thruhike #hikertrash #hikeyourownhike #hikerlife #nationalpark #nature @appalachian.trail @appalachiantrailphotos @womenwhohike"

With an awesome sunrise, a nap, and still an early start, it was shaping up to be a great day. Within a few miles, I came to a nice view overlooking across a valley to the mountains on the other side.

After laying around for a bit, we finally broke camp and began our day. We took full advantage of the bathroom facilities at the shelter, known on trail as the Fontana Hilton, and washed our faces and hands under real running water. You don't realize how nice indoor plumbing is until you don't have it anymore!<br><br>After making ourselves more presentable, we went about making some coffee and drying our tent out in the sunshine while we waited for the Browns to arrive. Once they got there, we went to check out the Fontana Dam and showed them the trail through town. We then made our way to Fontana Village where we enjoyed a tasty lunch and a round of putt-putt golf. The weather was again beautiful and perfect for it!<br><br>Still doing the hiker shuffle from the previous day's exertion, we decided to stay the night at the Fontana Resort. We got ourselves a room and picked up a much anticipated package from The Baiers! After bringing the package to our room, we quickly opened it and were estatic to see the tasty treats inside - chocolate covered coffee beans, Welch's fruit snacks, tea with honey sticks, and freeze dried mangoes to name a few! Yum!<br><br>After saying goodbye to the Browns, we spent the rest of the day relaxing in the sun outside our room while we dried out the rest of our gear. With a couple of beers in hand, it was the perfect end to a relaxing day!<br><br>Pictures<br>1. View of Fontana Lake from the shelter area<br>2. Low side of Fontana Dam<br>3.

On the way, we even saw a yearling black bear from the shuttle!However, once we left the gap, we were once again greeted by fog as we arrived at Clingman's Dome.<br><br>As we began our hike, our spirits were high. Sure, the trail was still covered in big  puddles but at least the water wasn't actively flowing down it anymore! Plus, it wasn't raining. The first couple hours on trail were really nice with easy downhills and minor climbs. We chatted about Gatlinburg and the books Yooper had finished recently as it began sprinkling.<br><br>After stopping for a quick lunch that  included a deer sighting, we kept on heading towards the south end of the park. Little did we know, our day was about to go south as well. As we continued walking, the rain picked up and, more alarmingly, the trail went from being covered in puddles to a full on mud pit. With every step uphill, we slid half a step back; every step downhill resulted in a battle to stay upright. This constant fight to make progress was tiring and, more so, frustrating. <br>After making it to Derrick Knob Shelter, we called it a day even though we were hoping to push further south. With the rain subsiding for a minute, we quickly found a flat spot to set up camp as the shelter was full and made dinner. Tired and wet, we crawled into our sleeping bags and fell asleep praying that tomorrow would bring better weather.<br><br>Pictures<br>1. A look at our soggy trail<br>2. Mushroom,  mushroom!<br>3.

We scarfed down another carb heavy breakfast and made the short walk from the hotel to the NOC Outfitter to catch the free shuttle ran by a local baptist church. As we arrived, we were shocked to see about two dozen hikers already waiting.  Fortunately for us, another hiker had the number for an additional free shuttle and after waiting about half an hour, we were on our way! <br>Unfortunately for us, as soon as we left Gatlinburg, the rain started again. Upon arriving at Newfound Gap, we donned our rain gear and began heading towards Clingman Dome. At a height of 6667 feet, it is the highest point on the Appalachian Trail. As we made our ascent, we were once again surrounded by a dense, mossy forest and flooded trail. The forest was beautiful but we were getting pretty sick of hiking in the rain. While our first day in the park was beautiful, it has rained every day since. <br>As we continued along, we both kept thinking back to the warm bed we had left in Gatlinburg and as we became more waterlogged, we decided that after making it to Clingman's Dome, we'd hitch back into town and enjoy one more night in a dry bed. Once we arrived at Clingman's, we climbed the viewing tower even though we knew what the view would look like - nothing but the inside of a cloud.<br><br>After descending the tower, we walked down to the parking lot and worked on hitching back to town. We asked about half a dozen people before a young, recently married couple agreed to let us ride down with them. They were super friendly and we enjoyed talking to them as we made our way back out of the mountains. <br>After securing another hotel room, we quickly picked up another pizza and a few beverages for the night before retiring to our room. Rain or shine, tomorrow we're back on trail!<br><br>Pictures<br>1. Moose on the soggy trail<br>2. View of the mossy trail<br>3. Our view from Clingman's Dome<br>4.

So I packed my gear together and made my way out of Duncannon and across the Juniata and Susquehanna Rivers. This part of the day was a couple miles of easy road walking to where Keg and I had planned to meet up for my first food resupply. I got there early and stretched and snacked while I waited for Keg to arrive. When he got there around noon, we drove back into Duncannon for lunch and stopped at a dollar store for some last minute supplies. After the resupply, Keg dropped me back off at the trailhead and I started my climb up the mountain. It was another beautiful day to be out hiking and even with a full pack I felt good and was moving right along. I had originally only planned to go about 3 miles to the next shelter but I changed my mind to continue past it to a campsite with a view overlooking the Susquehanna and into Harrisburg. The campsite was a little rocky but I found a flat spot to set up and then watched the last colors of the sunset slowly fade away and turn to night #optoutside #scenicpa #pennslyvania #backpacking #atclassof2018 #trektheat #thetrek #appalachiantrail"

I never could have imagined the companionship I have found from these 4 strangers when I started my hike 8 weeks ago. They have lifted me up from pure misery in the smokies, we have crammed our stinky bodies into sedans and creepy vans for soda and snacks, we post up like homeless people outside of stores together, and we are there for each other at the end of a long day. Could I have made it this far without them? Maybe... But what I know for sure is this experience is exponentially better because of the people sitting on a log beside me at the end of each day. ❤️ Love ya tram. .<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#at2018 #atclassof2018 #thruhike2018 #georgiatomaine2018 #trektheat #thetrek #georgiatomaine #womeninthewild #appalachiantrials #appalachiantrail #womenwhohike #optoutside #rei1440project #backpacking #thruhike #hikertrash #hikeyourownhike #hikerlife #nationalpark #nature @appalachian.trail @appalachiantrailphotos"

So instead of getting an early start to the day, I dozed back off and slept on and off until almost 1. I then slowly rallied myself to get moving, eat, and break camp and by the time I was actually on the trail it was 330. I made my way down the trail and found myself at the next shelter a few hours later around 715. Another hiker just out for the night was already set up and had a fire going so we talked while we both ate dinner and then snuffed out the fire before calling it a night. The next morning, I had a fairly early start and made my way down from the shelter and into Duncannon. Along the way I came to Hawk Rock, a beautiful vista overlooking Duncannon and the surrounding area. As I continued my descent into town, I couldn't help but daydream about real food and a shower so my first stop in town was a cheesesteak place, followed by a bed and a shower at the Doyle Hotel..another great day on trail #optoutside #appalachiantrail #atclassof2018 #trektheat #thetrek #backpacking #scenicpa #pennslyvania"

Not the point. I was hiking thru light rain, no big deal, I've been thru worse.  It was really windy when a huge gust hits. I hear a really loud crack where I thought, ""wow that sounds close,"" and jumped forward. I looked back to see that large branch you see there hit the ground 12"" behind me.

Our haven last night, from the 70 mph gusts of wind blowing stinging rain into our faces as we crossed two miles of exposed balds. There’s nothing like showing up to a shelter, shedding your drenched clothing and warming up in a sleeping bag with fellow hikers all around.

This stretch of almost 15 miles had little options in the way of clean water (other than streams flowing through farmland with possible pesticide runoff) and no shelters or stealth sites to camp at. So with this in mind, I slowly brought myself to break camp once the intermittent rain stopped and I headed towards Boiling Springs to fill up water and get my thru hiker tag at the AT office there. As I left the AT office, I debated stopping in town for a quick breakfast but decided against it since it was already noon (my earliest start so far..officially living up to my trail name ""Production"") and I wanted to finish today's hike with daylight. The next 10 or so miles were mostly flat, easy walking through pastures, fields, and treelines. Along the way I saw every kind of weather imaginable-rain, snow, hail, gusty wind, and sunshine all mixed in. Throughout the day, I also crossed my first few stiles (steps over a pasture fence) and was even greeted by a couple of horses as I crossed the field they grazed in. Despite the elements I made it to the last 3 miles of my day, a climb up to Darlington shelter. The climb was not the steepest I'd ever done but it was just a long, continuous stretch of trail that climbed up the side of the mountain without any switchbacks or turns to break up the elevation change. However, the thought of shepherd's pie and sleep propelled me up the mountain and when I reached the top I was treated to my first real overlook of the hike looking back towards Boiling Springs and across the fields and treelines I had just walked that day. It was truly rewarding to look across the overlook to see where I had started and where I stood now and I wanted to chase that feeling for the rest of my journey #optoutside #trektheat #thetrek #appalachiantrail #thruhike #atclassof2018 #backpacking #scenicpa #pennslyvania"

It was a whirlwind of emotions for me. Remembering back to the terrified new backpacker I was when I started and comparing it to the woman I have become on the trail fills me with pride in myself. I had never seen a mountain, I had never climbed one, and although I had 2 overnight backpacking experiences, I had alot to learn. Now here I am, over 20% of the way through 2,190 miles. Everyday I feel blessed to be able to hike this trail and experience all that it has to offer. There is still alot of trail left for my feet to tread before I have completed this dream of mine, but today was a huge milestone for me. I hope that Virginia and it's 600+ miles will continue to put me in awe instead of give me the blues.

Whether it was a venmo trail magic, mailing me random shit I've asked for, hiking with me, whether you've passed me or still hiking with me.  This has truely been the most incredible journey of my life and it's just getting started.  I never imagined someone like me could find such peace.

We ate lunch soaking up the sun with our toes in the grass at over mountain shelter. We also crossed out of North Carolina for the last time on the trail and will be in Tennessee now until Virginia in just a few days!

In the past month I have hiked 300 miles along the Appalachian Trail, through Georgia, North Carolina, and Tennessee. I have trekked through snow three times, been woken up by marble sized hail hitting my tent, and have experienced a lot of rain. I’ve cried twice over cold fingers, once over blisters, and have teared up at several overlooks because these mountains are just so damn beautiful. I have met some of the most interesting people, been separated from them, then met more incredible people. Trail life has been something, y’all.

The generosity that surrounds me is out of this world. A man even paid for my breakfast just for chatting with him!<br>We took a little road trip into Asheville and it was a cute little town with a great Chinese and sushi buffet.

We feel so loved and supported!  The “take a hike” party was so much fun and we appreciate all the well wishes, gifts, and stash of trail food.  It seems like a lot of food but once the hunger kicks in we will likely devour it all!  April 11th is fast approaching so we spent much of the afternoon re-packing and sorting.  Both of our packs should start out around 20 pounds with good and water which we feel pretty good about.  The household check off list is almost done, the weather is warming up, and we are getting more and more excited about this great adventure called an Appalachian Trail Thru-hike . .<br>#appalachiantrail<br>#AT #trektheat #thetrek #hike #takeahike #hiking #thruhike #backpacking #hikertrash #optoutside<br>#mountains #rei #atclassof2018<br>#georgiatomaine<br>#adventure"

But you can’t keep a good hiker out of the forest for long, nor would we want to. So as you can see from this photo, Veggie is thrilled to be back in the Trail again. Through the mysterious power of Trail Magic, this was taken when I was coming back from a shuttle run and, “strangely enough,” ran into Veggie two days after he left at one of the few spots where the Trail touches the forest service road climbing Wayah Bald. As some of you may have figured out by now, there are no coincidences, and it was a great opportunity for me to give him a fond farewell again while seeing him in his natural habitat. Hahaha!

It's southern terminus is at Springer Mountain,GA and it's northern at Mount Katahdin, ME. Most hikers take between 4 and 6 months to complete their thru hike, though so have completed it much, much faster!<br>.<br>This adventure has been two years in the making and we are so excited that it is finally here!<br>.<br>For our hike, we will be doing what is called a flip flop! This means that we are not traveling north from the southern terminus (NOBO) or south from the northern terminus (SOBO) but will be starting somewhere in the middle, though we will complete the entire trail. For our starting location, we have chosen Damascus, VA. From there, we will head to Georgia where we will then be picked up and brought back to Damascus, VA and then we will begin traveling north to Maine.<br>.<br>Keep an eye out for updates as we traverse the AT and live life at 2 mph! If you have any questions along the way, feel free to comment or leave us a message!

I normally don't share photos of flowers, etc, but I couldn't help it since I placed it next to my new favorite coffee table book - The Appalachian Trail (a Mother's Day gift).
