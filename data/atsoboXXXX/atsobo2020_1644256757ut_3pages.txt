My heart aches to go back, to do it again, to retrace my memories and to make new ones. I want to sleep directly under the stars and meet more people who follow their big dreams. I want to eat more stacks of pancakes before leaving towns and feel my heart pump as I spot the sign on the top of Katahdin. I‚Äôve almost forgotten how amazing a shower feels after hiking for days. I want to walk this trail over and over. I get asked whether I am forgetting the bad, that it couldn‚Äôt be this fantastic. Not all adventures are pony rides in May sunshine, said J.R. Tolkien in the Hobbit. But even when I busted my wrist or my knee wanted to give out, I didn‚Äôt want to be anywhere else. I lived an adventure every day. I never knew what view I would find at the top of the next mountain, who I would meet and what would happen. I appreciated living, and was present for it. I itch for that kind of magic. I aim to continue living a life so full. <br><br>#appalachiantrailthruhike #appalachiantrailclassof2020 #atnobo2020 #atsobo2020 #womenwhohike

It made me dig so deep I thought I‚Äôd never return, so deep I didn‚Äôt feel human at times. It was where I learned to release my control.

On September 11th, I climbed up to Anthony‚Äôs Nose and watched the sun rise over the Hudson River. I then crossed the Bear Mountain Bridge (lowest elevation on the whole AT), replaced my shoes which had completely lost their tread, and met up with Hi Viz, who I first met on Katahdin and hadn‚Äôt seen since southern Maine. I crossed over Bear Mountain and stopped my day early to stay at the only shelter with a view of the NYC skyline. I had the shelter to myself that night and watched the illuminated skyline and the 9/11 Tribute in Light where the twin towers stood, all from my sleeping bag.<br><br>The following day, I completed my first marathon day of my hike (26.3 miles) and camped out at the Warwick Drive-In, which allows AT hikers to tent for free at the movies. One day later I was across the New York/New Jersey state line and into my 7th state of the hike. <br><br>#appalachiantrail #thruhike #at2020 #atsobo #atsobo2020 #takeahike #hikertrash #backpackingadventures #newyork #hikersofinstagram #trektheat #hikingadventures

Hitting New York in early September brought the last blast of summer, and the last oppressively hot weather I would experience for the rest of the trail.<br>New York also brought something truly amazing: the deli blaze. As the trail crosses many roads and through populated areas, you can string together several days where a delicious deli sandwich for lunch or dinner is on or near the trail.<br>The AT also passed several very old and large Oak trees which were beautiful to see.<br>This stretch of trail brought me the closest I‚Äôve ever been to New York City, and the first time I‚Äôve ever seen the city‚Äôs skyline. Although it was some 30 or 40 miles away on the horizon, seeing the large city from a mountain trail was an interesting juxtaposition. I also enjoyed a very memorable night at a shelter overlooking the city on 9/11 which I will discuss in my next post.<br>#appalachiantrail #atsobo #stillontheat #atsobo2020 #newyorkcity #trektheat #backpacking #itsamazingoutthere #backpackingadventures #atclassof2020

More snow accumulated over night and once we got higher in elevation it was very noticeable. The snow drifts made walking extremely difficult. We were supposed to go up and over the Grayson Highlands but we were so slow going with all the snow we were unable to make it to where we wanted to be. We bailed out and got off before we could make it there. We felt like we needed to prioritize our safety over getting to see the ponies and the views. We have decided to skip that area until next spring when the snow is gone and we know the ponies will be out and about. We also wanted to do trail magic next year at some point so we plan to just do it all at one time next year!

I managed to stay warm all day except during lunch even with a fire at the shelter from another hiker drying out his clothes. My feet were my only problem since my socks and shoes soaked through.

It was a surprisingly easy day! The day began in a rhododendron tunnel for several miles before climbing up and walking a ridge area for most of the day. The climb down from angel‚Äôs rest overlook was pretty steep but manageable. We did 26 miles in about 9 hours which made me feel great! Knees were pretty sore when we got back to the hostel so I pretty much laid in bed the rest of the evening. The weather wasn‚Äôt supposed to be the greatest this day so we had decided to slack this section but we got surprised with a beautiful day! Very thankful for the break in crappy weather to let us knock out the big miles and put us ahead of schedule! It helped for sure because the weather for the next week is not looking so good.. Fingers crossed it changes because right now we are facing rain and snow on/off for the next 7-10 days. 140 miles left and we plan to push big miles on the days that are clear and figure out what to do on the bad days. Might be some more slack packing unfortunately on those days to just get some miles in but not be completely miserable. I‚Äôm all about hike your own hike so if you don‚Äôt like what we‚Äôre doing/planning, then unfollow me. This year has not been a typical thru-hike. We have had to be very flexible in our hike and make it the best we can. Only a week left on trail! Going to try and enjoy every last bit! <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #AT2020 #ATnobo2020 #ATFlipFlop2020 #ATsobo2020 #appalachiantrail2020 #appalachianlife #ATclassof2020 #StillOnTheAT #trektheat #thetrek #withguthook #hikemoreworryless #optoutside #wekeepyououtdoors #hikertrash #thruhike #hikerlife #getlost #backpacking #hikerlife #outdoorlife #hiking #adventure #wanderlust

It was so cold that I had to put my trekking poles away and walk with my hands in my pockets. I‚Äôd occasionally hide behind some rocks and take a break from the wind. After several miles we finally dropped back into the valley although it was still cold but not as windy. We got to see the oldest oak tree on the AT in the south (Keffer Oak). Now the story about the glove pic, I had dropped them and didn‚Äôt realize for about a mile. So I added 2 miles onto my day for a pair of gloves. I was ticked and then right after that I lost my nose ring. It was a rough day. The next day we woke up and climbed back up to another ridge and once again it was windy and cold but this time there was snow! It was a long day and this time we beat our biggest mileage and hiked 28 miles! Why? We quickly realized that we couldn‚Äôt camp up on the ridge and had to bail out and go to town so we hiked an extra 3 miles to a road and made it to town and got warm. The weather is quickly turning colder than we anticipated and are prepared for so now the real planning has begun to figure out how to finish the last little bit of trail..<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #AT2020 #ATnobo2020 #ATFlipFlop2020 #ATsobo2020 #appalachiantrail2020 #appalachianlife #ATclassof2020 #StillOnTheAT #trektheat #thetrek #withguthook #hikemoreworryless #optoutside #wekeepyououtdoors #hikertrash #thruhike #hikerlife #getlost #backpacking #hikerlife #outdoorlife #hiking #adventure #wanderlust

We slack packed again and went from Apple Orchard Mt to the James River. Starting at 4200 ft in elevation at 7:30 was a bit cold! We were in all our cold weather gear but our hands were still frozen so we put our poles in our bag and hiked with our hands in our pockets for a majority of the morning! Luckily we were going downhill most of the day. A few climbs here and there helped keep us warm. We found a spot that was blocked by the wind and in the sun so we stopped for lunch in the middle of the trail. Sometimes you just gotta do what you gotta do. We saw so much ice coming out of the ground or on the side of rocks. It is definitely turning into winter out here! Time to get a move on! <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #AT2020 #ATnobo2020 #ATFlipFlop2020 #ATsobo2020 #appalachiantrail2020 #appalachianlife #ATclassof2020 #StillOnTheAT #trektheat #thetrek #withguthook #hikemoreworryless #optoutside #wekeepyououtdoors #hikertrash #thruhike #hikerlife #getlost #backpacking #hikerlife #outdoorlife #hiking #adventure #wanderlust

I JUST HIKED THE ENTIRE APPALACHIAN TRAIL FROM MAINE TO GEORGIA.<br><br>It certainly wasn't the traditional northbound thru-hike I'd planned on for two years; and for that I'm grateful. Proud to say I hiked the hardest of the Triple Crown trails in the hardest direction during the hardest year for thru-hiking in recent history. Done in "purist" style... Continuous, no slackpacking, always southbound, not a single step of the trail missed(yes, even through the beaver pond in PA). I even added a dozen 4K peaks in New England, running out-and-backs all through the Whites.<br><br>My deepest gratitude to all my friends and family that have helped me along the way, I couldn't have done this without you. Huge thanks to @athleticbrewing for the support these last 13 months, and thanks @liteaf_gear for giving me this 20L prototype to challenge myself with the last 800 miles.<br><br>Happy Trails!<br>-Armadillo, AT SOBO 2020

It was below freezing so I stayed in my sleeping bag until I absolutely had to get up üòÇ We had a short day planned to get to town so I wasn‚Äôt to worried about getting up and leaving. After hiking for a bit I remembered I felt something on my butt in the middle of the night that I couldn‚Äôt deal with due to it being dark. I unfortunately realized that I had a tick embedded and the site looked extremely irritated. It had probably been there for a day or so. (I‚Äôve gotta get better at doing nightly tick checks..) We immediately removed it and began the steps on getting some doxycycline (thanks mom for all the work!!). My biggest fear out on the trail is getting Lyme Disease. Fingers crossed this tick was not a carrier and/or I caught it and got the meds in time. <br>We had run into Michigan Mille 2 days before (again!) and were so glad we got to hang out with her for the past few days. Although this is probably the last time we will see her, I‚Äôm so glad we got to hang out and hike together one last time (for real this time?

We have entered into the final state of this thru-hike! Virginia is about 1/4 of the whole AT! Thankful for this whole amazing opportunity to hike this amazing trail. I‚Äôm so happy we‚Äôve made it this far! Before we left West Virginia, we stopped by the ATC HQ and took our pictures. SUCKS we couldn‚Äôt get our Polaroid for the 2020 book (damn ATC) but oh well. We took our own photos and that‚Äôs good enough. We saw lots of stick bugs today and started the Virginia Roller Coaster section (14 miles of steep climbs and descents). We stopped about 5 miles in at a hostel that was allowing camping but turns out the first group there is able to stay in the hostel! So we did that and got a sweet deal of a bed, pizza, ice cream, soda and laundry! It was so worth it as it dropped into the 30‚Äôs that night! I also got the best night sleep I‚Äôve had in a while. I probably slept 12 hours. I must have really needed it! Day 1 of Virginia was not so bad after all. <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #AT2020 #ATnobo2020 #ATFlipFlop2020 #ATsobo2020 #appalachiantrail2020 #appalachianlife #ATclassof2020 #StillOnTheAT #trektheat #thetrek #withguthook #hikemoreworryless #optoutside #wekeepyououtdoors #hikertrash #thruhike #hikerlife #getlost #backpacking #hikerlife #outdoorlife #hiking #adventure #wanderlust

There‚Äôs a sense of urgency to push more miles, leave earlier in the morning, break shorter. I hike 17 to 22 miles a day now.

Other times it‚Äôs for Mayo, to get him further south so he can hike to Georgia in better weather. <br><br>Whatever the reason, I can hardly put words to how cozy I am in my sleeping bag letting my tired legs and worn mind rest, if only for a few more minutes while listening to the rain. <br><br>***<br>I hit my 1,300 mile mark today.

I was joined by the lovely @akuwik for this section and we made the long climb up Mt Madison before camping below treeline for the night.<br><br>The next morning we set off in a heavy fog across the rocks of Mt Adams and Mt Jefferson (in first photo) toward Mt Washington. We were fortunate enough to get a few momentary breaks in the cloud cover to take in the views from the highest point in New England. We even had some disappointing pizza from the visitor‚Äôs center at the top.<br><br>The clouds broke on the southern side of Mt Washington as trekked to get past Mt Eisenhower and Mt Jackson in the late afternoon and evening. Although I look forward to visiting here again in better weather, the views I did get from atop the Presidentials were breathtaking and definitely worth the hype.<br><br>#atsobo #thruhiking #whitemountains #appalachiantrail #atsobo2020 #thruhiker #trektheat #at2020 #stillontheat2020 #newhampshire #mountwashington #wildernessculture #optoutside

It makes me laugh the things I thought were hard when I was going NOBO. Granted, the last time I was here it was less the terrain, more the rain. One time I woke up almost floating on my sleeping pad from the amount of flooding in the tentüòÖ It was so insane and I was so miserable that all I could do was laugh.

Had a fantastic stay at a trail angels house who slack packed me for 85 miles, caught some epic sunsets, and became very familiar with night hiking to make up for my slowing pace and increasing daily mileage. My parents came down to support me for the state of Georgia (~78 miles) and then drove me back to Maine. The smokies were socked in for the entirety of my hike thru them except for one decent view. The thousand foot + climbs felt easy towards the end but the wheels started falling off bc of the daily avg of 5-7 hours of sleep and 16+ hours of hiking in GA. <br><br>The final picture is of me on Springer Mtn, the southern terminus of the AT. 15.1 miles of unfinished business left.<br><br>#appalachiantrail2020 #appalachiantrailclassof2020 #atsobo2020 #atsobo #thruhike #appalachiantrail

The promise of an epic climb with jaw-dropping views of mountains that go on forever like waves of the ocean. <br><br>But I love Vermont. The trees are clutching to more of their leaves, giving me hope fall will linger on my path back to the south. <br><br>I‚Äôm facing more struggle here. More rain. Less light. More miles than I‚Äôve ever hiked before. But my spirits are high, as is my determination to complete my hike. But that will be tested as the rain visits more often and the days more quickly turn into night. #appalachiantrail #atclassof2020 #atflipflop #atsobo2020 #atsobo #womenwhohike #adventure #hike #hikersofinstagramüíÜüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I hadn‚Äôt realized how much I‚Äôve been underestimating Sawyer until today. I am always so worried and careful about his feet and his mileage and his food intake... but today I realized, he is just crushing it. He flies up mountains and rock scrambles. He almost never needs help and if he does, he stops and waits for me to lift him up a boulder. He learned only a couple days in to move out of the trail to let people coming north pass by. He has the same amount of enthusiasm every morning when it‚Äôs time to hike again and loves climbing in the tent as much as we do at the end of the day. I‚Äôm sorry I ever doubted you big boy. There is nothing I love more than squeezing you at the end of a long day.<br><br>#appalachiantrail #at2020 #atsobo #thruhike #atclassof2020 #sobo #atsobo2020 #hikelikeagirl #stillontheat #healingtrauma #freedom #backpacking #massachusetts #backpackingwithdogs #hikingwithdogs

I think I like this part of the trail.  Easier trail to hike, without knee bashing climbs or foot pounding rocks, and some occasional rewarding views. I did my first 30+ mile day today. There was a brief detour on trail, but it brought me past where there was some prepared food I could fill my belly with.

This might sound like no big deal- but we have a 3 year old human child... and he did GREAT! Cooper, at 9 years old, is a seasoned backpacker. He knows the comforts of his tent, how to alert us of new campers in the shelter area üòÇü§´üôÑ, and how to enjoy a nice long drink from a mountain stream (of which there were few bc the forest was bone dry!) We planned our trip for a thurs and fri night; to avoid the weekend crowd (which was building as we made our narrow escape from the park Sat AM). Harriman, like many of our natural areas this summer, has seen heavy use. We saw evidence of the over-love and we did our part to leave no trace: as I know all of you do as well because you are so awesome!! Swipe to see our littlest backpacker with his tiny nap sack that I made in 30min as we loaded our gear into the car haha! Thanks @gnomegrowngear for the inspiration to build the little guy something! And thank you @natureaddictlady for the tips on how to avoid crowds. @tybeetotherescue I kept thinking of your photos of the flaming blueberry bushes from last year, and was pleasantly surprised to see that Harriman had groves of blueberry!! #hikeharriman #backpackingnewyork #backpackingdog #backcountrypaws #traildog #happytraildogs #leavenotrace #littlebackpacker #littlehikers #flamingblueberrybushes #atsobo2020 #atsobo #sobosunite #adventuredog #adventuretraildog #harrimanstateparkny

I‚Äôm less rushed. I stop to take in the views, even when I know there‚Äôs a better one up the way. I can stop and just breathe. I still feel the need to rush by, but my resolve to be present is stronger than it‚Äôs ever been. This is who I am and I am proud to be her, smiling at how simple this life feels right now. I‚Äôm a work-in-progress. Aren‚Äôt we all?<br><br>I wasn‚Äôt supposed to be here. At least not right now, not walking south. I thought I would be done with my 2,193-mile northbound journey and heading home, all my questions about life kneaded over for months. Maybe I‚Äôd come home with some answers. But because of Covid and my delayed start, I‚Äôm very much in the middle of this journey. Some days I have everything figured out. On others, I fall into a wormhole of questions and emotions and I‚Äôm thankful I have more miles to work them out. <br><br>I don‚Äôt know how it would feel if I was finishing now like I thought I was supposed to. All I know is I‚Äôm alone in my red tent, my light aglow, as the song ‚ÄúHallellijula‚Äù plays and I‚Äôm happy. I feel like I‚Äôm the most me I can be.

Out here my body knows more than I do and I listen to it. I listen when it‚Äôs tired, when it‚Äôs hurt. I rest it, I massage it. I most definitely feed it. I stop and think throughout the day- what do you need? Have I given you enough water, enough electrolytes? My god you are so strong and fucking beautiful- do you even know how many mountains you‚Äôve climbed today, legs? <br>Emotionally, there is nothing better than just experiencing and soaking in every wave that hits you. My first reaction used to be- so you‚Äôre uncomfortable, what can I do to fix this, how can I get back to being happy and smiling? Now it‚Äôs just, oh you‚Äôre angry? Be fucking angry. Be so angry you scream into nothingness. You‚Äôre sad? Cry. Feel your sadness so deep you think you won‚Äôt ever crawl out of it. Wallow in self pity for as long as you need. Because inevitably, these emotions play themselves out and I learn something every damn time they do.<br><br>#appalachiantrail #at2020 #atsobo #thruhike #atclassof2020 #sobo #atsobo2020 #hikelikeagirl #stillontheat #healingtrauma #newhampshire #livefreeordie #freedom #backpacking #whitemountains #whitemountainsnh

Hit 100 miles on trail that day, and finally got to @shawshikerhostel to sleep somewhere other than the woods for the first time in 9 days.<br><br>Day 7: Mile 114.5. Took my first zero day on trail at Shaw's. Got some much needed rest, a resupply, ate a ton of food in town, hung out with dogs and hikers, and had Poet's famous "best breakfast on trail".<br><br>Day 8: Mile 123.5. Waiting on a pair of shoes to get to the post office in Caratunk, so I have 3 days to cover 33 miles. It kinda sucks switching to such low milage for a few days, especially after a zero...

Our new trail fam, "Team Hype Fleece", set out on our first soul-destroying day of hiking together. Over 23.9 miles with 7500ft of elevation gain over harsh terrain, we pushed over Whitecap Mountain and all of the Chairback Range in a day. We slugged our damaged bodies into camp at Cloud Pond at 11:30pm... But a late night of hiking meant a great ridgeline sunset, and even better star gazing. Almost out of The Hundo already.

Here we are, the bridge over Katahdin Stream past Abol Campground. In 2017, I led a trail crew with MCC and helped build this bridge that passes over the AT. My team didn't finish the bridge and unfortunately it got burned by a forest fire, but it still stands and for me this was one of my main inspirations for my thru-hike. I'll take some pride in knowing that I had a hand in building this bridge that gives passage to hikers on the AT and that a part of me will always live on this trail. #maineconservationcorps #atsobo2020 #trektheat

As soon as I see one of those white rectangles ahead my heartbeats a little bit faster and so much excitement sets in. After those feelings pass it slowly leads into a calmness. A sense of peace and the ability to breath a little deeper and it allows my mind to unwind and just let‚Äôs me be me stripped down to the core. The magic of those little bits of paint you see every so often transports me to where I want to be and long to be when I‚Äôm not near them. The mystery of what lies ahead and the journey in front of me pulls me further and further down this surreal narrow path that so many before me have traveled. .<br>.<br>What is it about these white blazes for you? .<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#whiteblaze #whiteblazer #at #appalachia #appalachian_explorers #appalachian #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #atsectionhike #atthruhike #atthruhike2020 #nobo #sobo #hiking #hikertrashvogue #hikertrash #hikerlife #hikersofinstagram #hike #hikerva #hikeva #hikevirginia #atnobo2020 #atsobo2020 #at2020 #virginia #traillife #hikerchick #thetrail #naturalvirginia

Sure there are cars and it‚Äôs not really nature, but this footbridge was the only thing I knew about the Appalachian Trail prior to 5 years ago. I‚Äôve passed it frequently in my life and remember passing it as a kid and wondering what it was and wanting to walk that bridge because I thought it was cool that it went over the highway. Well day 4 this week I got to walk it! Shout out to the one truck that honked, made my day! Especially since the immediate uphill to Annapolis Rocks sucked soooooooooo bad! After 7 days out, we made it to PA, and are taking a zero. Celebrated with eating salad. It truly was what I was craving after not having a big appetite this week. We took it slow and steady to make sure we didn‚Äôt over do it. But the last couple of days, my pack has felt more a part of me rather than a hindrance. And I feel my legs getting stronger. Now if only my feet would chill...I suppose that will never happen. :) #at2020 #atthruhike2020  #atflipflop #atflipflop2020 #atnobo2020 #atsobo2020 #hikerhunger #backpacking #hiking #kulacloth #trek @hikerhunger #funnygirl

Pack is VERY full. It‚Äôs heavier than I expected. Heading to the #appalachiantrail tomorrow and I am very excited and nervous. Here‚Äôs to my ‚Äúwhy‚Äù. My reasoning for taking on this difficult and hopefully rewarding journey.<br>1) Time to process. Over the course of the past year there has been grief, sadness, and change. Time to process this with no distractions as well as figure out what‚Äôs next.<br>2) Spiritual growth. I would be lying if I said I was really thriving with my relationship with the Lord. It‚Äôs been a dry season and definitely related to the reasons behind number 1. <br>3) Happy endorphins from exercise. I‚Äôm not kidding. I love the feeling of confidence you get when you‚Äôve accomplished something you didn‚Äôt think you could do. Need to kick some mountain butt for a few sweet views.<br>4) Physical transformation. Not the primary purpose, but and added side effect to walking all day with a 30lb pack on your back up and down mountains. Side effect I will welcome with open arms. It‚Äôs not common for most women, but being overweight it will most likely happen.<br>5)Adventure, fun, community. Makes for great stories haha.<br>Here‚Äôs to the trail!

It was drizzling when I woke up so I decided to stay in my tent until after 8 because I wasn‚Äôt in the mood for starting the day with wet feet. The Pinhoti (turkey home) lives up to its name because I saw 3 turkeys shortly after getting on the trail. I also saw a gorgeous scarlet tangler for the first time (red with black wings). I‚Äôd never heard of them before. The red on it blew a cardinal‚Äôs out of the water. Short day because I didn‚Äôt want to over do it. Achilles was noticeable, but not hurting. Total was 12 miles and 2000‚Äô elevation gain. <br>Pic descriptions <br>1) actually got to a real trail and not walking on a gravel road<br>2) I didn‚Äôt realize but I camped alongside tons of wild blackberries. A month later and I would have had fresh fruit for breakfast (or a bear visit in the night)<br>3) saw some sassafras. It‚Äôs pretty unique and easy to spot because most plants have 1 leaf shape, but it has 3 (3 fingers, mitten, and oval). I believe they used to make tea with the roots similar to root beer. <br>4) some cool flower I saw<br>5) Mulberry Gap bike hostel. I was going to get a cold coke for lunch but they were closed so I sat at the gate and had lunch. <br>6) lunch<br>7) I forgot that I attract flies<br>8) metrics

Many hikers have quit or put their hike on hold, disheartened by the idea of having to skip over a celebrated portion of the trail. I began planning to go as far as Fontana Dam, on the southern edge of the Smokies, and find transportation around them, then return later to complete the section when the park reopens. This morning the situation shifted once again, and I heard that on March 27th the county where Fontana Dam is located is going to put a police barricade on the trail, and won‚Äôt admit any hikers. I‚Äôm sort of proud- in all my years traveling with punk bands, I‚Äôve never had an entire county call the cops on us two days in advance! Fortunately, I should be able to get a shuttle from the Nantahala Outdoor Center tomorrow.<br><br>If you try to beat the Trail, the Trail will beat you; I can‚Äôt control anything that‚Äôs happening, only how I choose to respond. Having started this journey SOBO, I signed up for adventure, a challenge, and a transformative experience- not hostels, trail magic, or partying with a big bubble of other hikers.

This was about 19 miles in, a little less than 20. He came barreling out of the woods in a full sprint, shirtless. He then took an hour long break, from 4:00pm-5:00pm. His breaks usually consist of stretching, rinsing his hair if necessary, changing his socks, taking necessary medicine, (snacking) hydrating, and drinking Rip Its. <br>After the break was done he proceeded to head on for the last stretch of the day, consisting of 6.7 miles. <br>#muckfichigan #hike #hiker #hiking #sobotoayoyo #sobo #sobo2020 #trektheat #at2020 #appalachiantrail #thruhiker #thruhiking #slackpacking #slackpack #atstrong #atsobo #atsobo2020 #winterhiking #lularoe #lularoeleggings #ripit #ripitenergy #ripitenergydrink

Personally I think everyone should watch it, fall in the love with the why then support it when the time comes!<br> https://www.facebook.com/1074564282715172/posts/1270564526448479/<br><br>#pebble2mountain #strokesurvivor #strokevsmountain #icandothis #atsobo2020 #futureATthruhiker #strokecantstopme

First because I had an hour and what better way to spend it then in the hammock! Second because the last video I posted was not complete.

A few more steps to get the financial stuff in order but this thru hike is going to happen.The nonprofit will change some lives for the better, we will celebrate life after stroke and/or traumatic brain injury! So start thinking of survivors who can meet me in 1 of the 14 states along the Appalachian Trail. We will show the world or maybe just ourselves that stroke or TBI can't hold us down. More to come soon.... #pebble2mountain #atsobo2020 #at2020 #sobo2020 #futurethruhiker #strokevsmountain #strokesurvivor #icandothis #nonprofitschangelives #hikeit #whoswithme

A few months back I came across a company, @coalatree . I ordered a pair of their Trailhead pants hoping for the best. Then I ordered a second pair then I added shorts. Friends took notice that frequently wore these pants on trail, to conference, to dinners. I challenged myself to wear the shorts until they smelled, looked dirty or had signs of wear. Finally after 3 weeks of daily wear I gave up trying to defeat the shorts! Needless to say today I ordered 2 more pairs. If you are looking for an eco friendly company that seems to have a good heart and some sweet gear check them out! I am not employed by them nor getting any kickbacks but they could hook me up if wanted!!! It's going to be a long hike! <br>https://coalatree.com/<br><br>#futurethruhiker #coalatree #mtn2cty #sobo2020 #pebble2mountain #p2m  #atsobo2020 #nursevsmountain #strokevsmountain #strokesurvivor #comfyhiking #justagirl

The first board meeting for Pebble2Mountain has finally taken place! Papers are filed and we are official! Much thanks to Kellye, Chelsey and Todd! The most supportive friends that anyone could ever ask for. My wish for anyone reading this is that you are blessed with people such as these. On the days that I question myself all it takes is a text or word from one of them to assure me that I am on the right track!!! #blessedami #supportunlimited #pebble2mountain #icandothis #atsobo2020 #futurethruhiker #1885grill

My love of the outdoors runs deep as does my pride and passion of surviving an aneurysm rupture and additional strokes. <br>Pebble2Mountain is (process of) a nonprofit with a vision. <br>In 2020 I will take to the Appalachian Trail. Life does not stop following a stroke and neither will I. <br>Pebble2Mountain will offer other stroke and aneurysm survivors an opportunity to highlight living life following an event. <br>My ultimate goal is to have a stroke survivor join me in all fourteen states along the trail. <br>Along with the help of dear friends we are in the planning stages. All prayers, well wishes, good vibes are welcome. I will do my best to update and share this planning process.
