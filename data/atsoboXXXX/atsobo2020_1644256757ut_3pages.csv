My heart aches to go back, to do it again, to retrace my memories and to make new ones. I want to sleep directly under the stars and meet more people who follow their big dreams. I want to eat more stacks of pancakes before leaving towns and feel my heart pump as I spot the sign on the top of Katahdin. I‚Äôve almost forgotten how amazing a shower feels after hiking for days. I want to walk this trail over and over. I get asked whether I am forgetting the bad, that it couldn‚Äôt be this fantastic. Not all adventures are pony rides in May sunshine, said J.R. Tolkien in the Hobbit. But even when I busted my wrist or my knee wanted to give out, I didn‚Äôt want to be anywhere else. I lived an adventure every day. I never knew what view I would find at the top of the next mountain, who I would meet and what would happen. I appreciated living, and was present for it. I itch for that kind of magic.

The climb down from angel‚Äôs rest overlook was pretty steep but manageable. We did 26 miles in about 9 hours which made me feel great! Knees were pretty sore when we got back to the hostel so I pretty much laid in bed the rest of the evening. The weather wasn‚Äôt supposed to be the greatest this day so we had decided to slack this section but we got surprised with a beautiful day! Very thankful for the break in crappy weather to let us knock out the big miles and put us ahead of schedule! It helped for sure because the weather for the next week is not looking so good.. Fingers crossed it changes because right now we are facing rain and snow on/off for the next 7-10 days. 140 miles left and we plan to push big miles on the days that are clear and figure out what to do on the bad days. Might be some more slack packing unfortunately on those days to just get some miles in but not be completely miserable. I‚Äôm all about hike your own hike so if you don‚Äôt like what we‚Äôre doing/planning, then unfollow me. This year has not been a typical thru-hike. We have had to be very flexible in our hike and make it the best we can. Only a week left on trail! Going to try and enjoy every last bit! <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #AT2020 #ATnobo2020 #ATFlipFlop2020 #ATsobo2020 #appalachiantrail2020 #appalachianlife #ATclassof2020 #StillOnTheAT #trektheat #thetrek #withguthook #hikemoreworryless #optoutside #wekeepyououtdoors #hikertrash #thruhike #hikerlife #getlost #backpacking #hikerlife #outdoorlife #hiking #adventure #wanderlust"

It was so cold that I had to put my trekking poles away and walk with my hands in my pockets. I‚Äôd occasionally hide behind some rocks and take a break from the wind. After several miles we finally dropped back into the valley although it was still cold but not as windy. We got to see the oldest oak tree on the AT in the south (Keffer Oak). Now the story about the glove pic, I had dropped them and didn‚Äôt realize for about a mile. So I added 2 miles onto my day for a pair of gloves. I was ticked and then right after that I lost my nose ring. It was a rough day. The next day we woke up and climbed back up to another ridge and once again it was windy and cold but this time there was snow! It was a long day and this time we beat our biggest mileage and hiked 28 miles! Why? We quickly realized that we couldn‚Äôt camp up on the ridge and had to bail out and go to town so we hiked an extra 3 miles to a road and made it to town and got warm.

I‚Äôm so happy we‚Äôve made it this far! Before we left West Virginia, we stopped by the ATC HQ and took our pictures. SUCKS we couldn‚Äôt get our Polaroid for the 2020 book (damn ATC) but oh well. We took our own photos and that‚Äôs good enough. We saw lots of stick bugs today and started the Virginia Roller Coaster section (14 miles of steep climbs and descents). We stopped about 5 miles in at a hostel that was allowing camping but turns out the first group there is able to stay in the hostel! So we did that and got a sweet deal of a bed, pizza, ice cream, soda and laundry! It was so worth it as it dropped into the 30‚Äôs that night! I also got the best night sleep I‚Äôve had in a while. I probably slept 12 hours. I must have really needed it!

We planned our trip for a thurs and fri night; to avoid the weekend crowd (which was building as we made our narrow escape from the park Sat AM). Harriman, like many of our natural areas this summer, has seen heavy use. We saw evidence of the over-love and we did our part to leave no trace: as I know all of you do as well because you are so awesome!! Swipe to see our littlest backpacker with his tiny nap sack that I made in 30min as we loaded our gear into the car haha! Thanks @gnomegrowngear for the inspiration to build the little guy something!

As soon as I see one of those white rectangles ahead my heartbeats a little bit faster and so much excitement sets in. After those feelings pass it slowly leads into a calmness. A sense of peace and the ability to breath a little deeper and it allows my mind to unwind and just let‚Äôs me be me stripped down to the core. The magic of those little bits of paint you see every so often transports me to where I want to be and long to be when I‚Äôm not near them.

Sure there are cars and it‚Äôs not really nature, but this footbridge was the only thing I knew about the Appalachian Trail prior to 5 years ago. I‚Äôve passed it frequently in my life and remember passing it as a kid and wondering what it was and wanting to walk that bridge because I thought it was cool that it went over the highway. Well day 4 this week I got to walk it! Shout out to the one truck that honked, made my day! Especially since the immediate uphill to Annapolis Rocks sucked soooooooooo bad! After 7 days out, we made it to PA, and are taking a zero. Celebrated with eating salad. It truly was what I was craving after not having a big appetite this week. We took it slow and steady to make sure we didn‚Äôt over do it. But the last couple of days, my pack has felt more a part of me rather than a hindrance. And I feel my legs getting stronger.

Time to process this with no distractions as well as figure out what‚Äôs next.<br>2) Spiritual growth. I would be lying if I said I was really thriving with my relationship with the Lord. It‚Äôs been a dry season and definitely related to the reasons behind number 1. <br>3) Happy endorphins from exercise. I‚Äôm not kidding. I love the feeling of confidence you get when you‚Äôve accomplished something you didn‚Äôt think you could do. Need to kick some mountain butt for a few sweet views.<br>4) Physical transformation. Not the primary purpose, but and added side effect to walking all day with a 30lb pack on your back up and down mountains. Side effect I will welcome with open arms.

I began planning to go as far as Fontana Dam, on the southern edge of the Smokies, and find transportation around them, then return later to complete the section when the park reopens. This morning the situation shifted once again, and I heard that on March 27th the county where Fontana Dam is located is going to put a police barricade on the trail, and won‚Äôt admit any hikers. I‚Äôm sort of proud- in all my years traveling with punk bands, I‚Äôve never had an entire county call the cops on us two days in advance! Fortunately, I should be able to get a shuttle from the Nantahala Outdoor Center tomorrow.<br><br>If you try to beat the Trail, the Trail will beat you; I can‚Äôt control anything that‚Äôs happening, only how I choose to respond. Having started this journey SOBO, I signed up for adventure, a challenge, and a transformative experience- not hostels, trail magic, or partying with a big bubble of other hikers.

Friends took notice that frequently wore these pants on trail, to conference, to dinners. I challenged myself to wear the shorts until they smelled, looked dirty or had signs of wear. Finally after 3 weeks of daily wear I gave up trying to defeat the shorts! Needless to say today I ordered 2 more pairs.
