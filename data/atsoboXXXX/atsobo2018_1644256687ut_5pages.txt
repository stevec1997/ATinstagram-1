No matter what crazy distance goals they set themselves, or what the trail threw at them, they never once said enough. When they announced their intention to complete the final thousand miles in 36 days I was sure it was more that they were capable of. It wasn‚Äôt. Yet there were days when I would have happily thrown in the towel. Over the endless climbs and weeks of rain, as the trail chipped away at me, it only made them stronger.<br><br>Looking back now, what I learned most from 2,000 miles with F&B, was never to assume that my limitations define their limitations (thankfully they don‚Äôt). Recently this lesson has seemed all the more apposite, because whether its kids who hike, or kids who strike for our climate, it‚Äôs clear they can aspire to, and achieve more than many are willing to give them credit for. Our best hope is that they can accomplish what this generation lacks the courage to.<br><br>Underestimate them at your peril... .<br>.<br>We have to thank @rotucomics for this amazing painting of Fizzy & Bear on the AT.

I had never been away from home for an extended period of time before this, and here I was in Maine, taking the first of my  steps on the A.T. With about 2,200 miles, and 14 states ahead of me I was unsure of what was to come. Over the next four months, I would get to know some of the coolest, most generous, and fun people. I would see some beautiful views, and I would have an experience that I would never trade. Thank you to everyone who supported me on this adventure, and to all of the A.T.

To start, there are now three types of backpacks you can choose from:<br><br>Normal 5 pound packs: This is usually the cheapest pack you can afford however, you can really get some solid packs that work for you. These heavy packs have all the creature comforts to enjoy your adventure.<br><br>Light 2.5 to 3 pound packs: These packs are usually your second pack you ever purchase and they are usually between $150 to $350 USD. They are still very comfortable to wear and pack great comforts. These are the best bang for the buck packs out there.<br>Lighter than 2.5 pound packs: These packs are usually bare bones but some still offer a range of comforts.  Pricing can be over $150 to $600 USD. These are the best of the best, but because of the light material used, handle with care. Examples are Osprey, Gregory, @zpacks, @hyperlite_mountain_gear, @gossamergear, @ulaequipment, @sixmoondesigns, and other various pack companies.<br><br>In closing, shop around for deals and wait for the sales. On average, if you can get a pack from 2 to 2.75 pounds for around $180 USD, you are way ahead of the base weight game.<br><br>https://cnocoutdoors.com/blogs/blog/pads-packs-hikingsailor<br><br>Clickable link in bio.<br><br>#backpacking #CnocOutdoors #AT2018 #thruhike #thruhiking #neverstopexploring  #atsobo2018 #AT2019 #ATclassof2019 #thetrailspeaks #hikingsailortips #sleepingpads #rvalues

Here's some advice from @the_hiking_sailor_at2019.<br>****<br>Good day, SOBOs. During my 772 mile hike on the Appalachian Trail in 2018, I thought I would share my experience in the first AT SOBO 450 miles. This region is in my backyard.<br>Tip #1 :Getting past Katahdin.  It is the hardest mountain on the whole AT, it seems, but I beg to differ, as you are going to be surprised at the many other challenges like Kelly‚Äôs Knob. But it is hard and for most of you, the time needed to climb up and down will take 8 hours. NOBOs can hike up and down in a very easy 3.5 hours.<br>Things that you can do to make things easier includes carrying a day pack up (Slackpacking it is called). You can exchange your pack with a day pack at the ranger station. Bring gloves, long pants, 3 liters of water, snacks, an extra jacket and clothing for element changes.<br><br>#Slackpacking #CnocOutdoors #AT2018 #AppalachianTrail #thruhike #thruhiking #neverstopexploring #katahdin #Maine #atsobo2018 #AT2019 #ATclassof2019 #thetrailspeaks #hikingsailortips

She‚Äôs answered every phone call about every concern I had about going southbound since the day I got my permit. I never knew when we met for one day in 2017 in Vermont at the Yellow Deli that we‚Äôd connect and that she would have such a lasting impact on me and my journey.<br>‚Üü<br>@fsedge129 and I met at a friend‚Äôs bachelorette party and did half of the trail in 2014. She texted me when she found out I was hiking and offered to come out with goodies when I got closer. I was only in Maine and I knew I had 1,900ish miles to go but the offer warmed my heart. After 5 months I finally made it and she totally went out of her way to come hiking with me for the day. We ended at Max Patch and sat in the sunshine for hours talking about trail life and goals for after.<br>‚Üü<br>@kellikreager and I met when we both became ambassadors for @mtnchicks and started the Georgia chapter. We met as strangers in January and the first night we realized how much in common we had, even graduating from the same college. But in that moment I would have never realized how much she would encourage me to hike and how amazing of a friend she‚Äôd become. She makes me a kinder and more compassionate person throughout all of this, meeting strangers and taking them into the woods on a walk and coming out best friends.<br>‚Üü<br>@sbasse and I also met through @mtnchicks at one of her events earlier this year. We had texted a lot and chatted on the phone occasionally but when we met in person I felt like I had know her for years. Recently, she welcomed smelly hikers into her home for three nights while we waited out a snow storm. I also got to catch up with @kristynashleigh in Asheville for a quick beer after only meeting once in Atlanta through another hiking friend. Basically, what I‚Äôm trying to say is mountains make for fast friendships and the past week has filled my heart up so much I think it‚Äôs gonna burst by the time I reach Springer.

This trail taught me a lot about my being, and really solidified the notion that I am my happiest self when I am among mountains and forests without the burden of societal ideals and expectations. Much love to everyone I met on trail, from a simple hello, to hiking with you for a few days or weeks, or to treating me to a meal or putting me up for the night you all made this trail that much more memorable. Here‚Äôs to grinding out two more years of school and getting back into the woods as soon as fucking possible. See ya on the flip side ü§ô#atsobo2018 #appalachiantrail #hiking #appalachia

For me, that means helping others and raising awareness. Hiking changed my life and drastically improved my mental health. After walking and thinking for over 1,500 miles and 134 days I decided that helping others and giving back of the next step in my journey. <br>In 2010, at the start of my freshman year in college, I decided I couldn‚Äôt suffer in silence any longer. I started going to therapy not knowing how it would change my life but desperate for help. I suffered from extreme depression, anxiety, PTSD, suicidal thoughts and a few attempts but therapy and hiking is what changed my life. The journey hasn‚Äôt been easy and there are still difficult days, but I was committed to bettering myself and my life. I worked extra hours at a retail job in college while going to school full time in order to pay for my therapy sessions myself. Most recently I graduated from 48-weeks in a Dialectical Behavior Therapy program which led me to realize how important hiking and being outdoors is to my mental health. Others aren‚Äôt as fortunate as I have been in this life. I have seen the darkest of times and I‚Äôve also seen the light at the end of the tunnel. Therapy is expensive and people often don‚Äôt know where to even start. I want to help first raise awareness and secondly raise money for an incredible cause.<br>-<br>Mental illness affects 1 out of 4 families in the United States, leaving those who suffer from it and their families searching for answers, cures and treatments that will allow them to experience the simple joy of living.<br>-<br>80% of your donation goes to scientific research to alleviate suffering from mental illness and to programs that eliminate the stigma surrounding it. 20% percent to preserve wilderness trails.

It took a while for all of us to leave the shelter because the wind was blowing and our clothes were wet. Du Jour cleared a lot of brush from the trail. It was funny watching him try to move giant fallen trees. üôÉ We also found a lil lizard/dinosaur. Around 2:30, Du Jour continued on to climb the Priest while I waited for the boy to come pick me up!! We drove into town, ate lots of food, and watched lots of movies.

Got back on the trail and did some night hiking to the shelter. At one point I looked to my left and saw some eyes shining back at me from a tree. I backed up to get a better look (I thought it was a raccoon or something), and saw a second pair of eyes that definitely belonged to a mama bear. I hiked back until Du Jour caught up. We saw two&nbsp;tiny baby bears up in a tree, but thankfully they climbed down and took off with mom. We made sure to be loud for the rest of the hike, so we wouldn't sneek up on anymore bears. (One tip is to recite the Gettysburg Address out loud. I have the first three and a half sentences memorized.) üêªüêªüêª #at2018 #atsobo2018 #atclassof2018 #appalachiantrail&nbsp;#virginia&nbsp;#tomfloydwayside&nbsp;#hearteyesontheAT

Jim makes the most beautiful hard carved spoons and places them on the trail for hikers to find. I first heard about him when I learned about the Appalachian Trail and was secretly hoping I‚Äôd be lucky enough to come across one of these spoons tucked away in the woods. I was really surprised when Jim reached out to me and offered to make me a spoon and after some organizing he left me a gift on the trail near where I was hiking. When I got to the spot that day the spoons and note were gone. I walked back to my trail friends with tears in my eyes, so upset that someone would take a note with my name on it and even more disappointed to tell Jim that they were gone. I sat and filtered my water and started to cry when I got stung on my bum by a bee. I kind of had a mini-meltdown but @janealexajane hand fed me bugles and my trail family made me laugh the last few miles of hiking that night. Jim went out of his way at 4:30 am to set the spoons out and even though someone snatched them, I was so grateful for the kindness he shared with me, to someone he‚Äôs never met. BUT the kindness doesn‚Äôt end there. @Carman63 saw Jim‚Äôs post about the missing spoons and he wanted to give forward a spoon he had. This Jim drove out from his home to Harper‚Äôs Ferry to deliver the spoon and also brought bagfuls of Chick-fil-A for 10 hikers! These are the people that make the Appalachian Trail so special and these are the memories that I will remember for forever. Thank you Jim and Jim for being apart of my thru-hike and for your endless kindness!

It was nice to really miss hiking- miss walking on rocks all day, squeezing a bag and watching my water slowly filter, the sound of the leaves rustling when the wind blows, sleeping outside and rising and falling with the sun. As nice as the creature comforts were, I feel more at home covered in dirt and sweat walking through green tunnel.

Sometimes it looks like this. The trail goes through plenty of towns. Even when it doesn‚Äôt, the distant sound of highways can often be heard. It‚Äôs a constant reminder of human presence and our impact on nature. The increasing scarcity of true wilderness is a fact. That saddens me a little, because it means losing such a fundamental part of what it means to be human.

Our bodies ache, but I am so proud. Hitting these milestones gives me that much more confidence that we can see this thing through til the end, and finish strong. <br>We‚Äôve got the Four State challenge, the Half Gallon challenge, and the halfway point coming up - more on that, and our last few weeks, soon enough! .<br>.<br>.<br>#atthruhike #womenwhohike #appalachiantrail #atsobo2018 #atclassof2018 #dogswhohike #optoutside #1000mileclub #marathoners

He&nbsp;started the trail after me and is already in New Jersey! He is raising money for a charity called Grant Us Hope that&nbsp;works with schools to implement suicide prevention and mental wellness programs. Visit his gofundme account linked on his profile&nbsp;page to read his story. He is almost to his $20,000 goal, which is amazing! I donated when I was in Maine; anxiety and depression were big factors that led me to the trail. If you can, it would be awesome to help @pkahninthewilderness reach his goal!<br><br>#grantushope #at2018 #atsobo2018 #atclassof2018 #appalachiantrail #massachusetts #aluxurioushotelingreatbarrington&nbsp;#hearteyesontheAT

Being kind and lending a hand can be helpful too.<br>-<br>During some relentless rain in Vermont, these three spent hours, and I mean HOURS and all afternoon making and maintaining a fire in the pouring rain.

The funny thing about being on the trail for over two months is, that when you finally think you‚Äôre getting comfortable and getting a hang of it, you realize you still have room to grow and miles to go.

Highlight, Firecracker and myself organized a Ladies slackpack day and we talked about life and boys for 18-solid-miles. I met Highlight on my first day when I stepped on to the bus to Millinocket. It was non-stop laughter ever since and I swear when we met it just felt like we had been friends for a lifetime. Her name Highlight has a little to do with her carrying an excessive amounts of highlighters with her on the trail always highlighting her guidebook but speaks more to her open-arms personality- she truly lights up every room she walks into. I met Firecracker in Monson, Maine after the 100 Mile Wilderness and I had been hearing about this girl for 100 miles.

I walked through rolling fields with blackberries, raspberries and cows and even though the air was thick and humid I somehow managed to push through.

New Hampshire was so rewarding but after spending half of my time in the rain I felt like I was never going to get out of NH. As I‚Äôm sitting here trying to remember dates and timelines- it just crossed my mind that I started the Long Trail in Vermont a year ago to the day. Feeling blown away by how incredible this world is and how everything in life can be so full circle. One of the biggest lessons I learned after losing my job over a year ago and buying a plane ticket the next day to go hiking was ‚Äòyou are exactly where you are meant to be‚Äô. After crossing into Vermont a year to the day and not even realizing it- I am once again reminded by the fact that everything in life has a purpose and reason, even if it doesn‚Äôt feel like it at the time. Follow your intuition and you will always be guided in the right direction.

I'm also still trying to figure out the logistics of how much food I need, which towns I should stop in, etc. One good thing did happen today though... blueberries!

The day before was one of my lowest on the trail with a slew of inconvenient problems- PMS, rain, chaffing, and a soaking wet tent. I felt like I couldn‚Äôt catch a break that day. The next morning was the day I had been most excited about since I started the trail. The first two miles I was walking through clouds and fog and morning mist. As I climbed above treeline the clouds started the part and I could see blue for the first time in what felt like days. I stood there with tears streaming down my face feeling so incredibly thankful for this journey and even for my shitty day the day before. The wind was so strong it was pushing me over and I just laughed to myself because that crazy wind was my answer to drying out all my sopping wet clothes and gear from the day before. If I didn‚Äôt have an incredibly awful day prior, I honestly wouldn‚Äôt have appreciated this moment the same. The trail picks you up and puts you back down but it‚Äôs how you interpret these moments that matters the most.

As I write this, my grandfather is on a new path. This time I can‚Äôt follow him. .<br>But now I‚Äôm back on trail and I‚Äôm beginning to appreciate it for what it is, and not for what I want it to be. The harder I fight the trail, the more frustrated I become. The trail will not change. I simply need to be patient and give the trail time to change me. In the meantime, there is still the sun on my face and the breeze on my finger tips. There is still the sound of the rain and peals of thunder. Terrifying, crushing, and brutal the trail may be, but with it comes a quiet beauty I rarely get to see: me, dying to the next me. . <br>I am dead. Long live me.

So today was a mellow 10ish mile day over saddleback junior (3k), the Horn (4K), and Saddleback (4K). Had great views for all of them except saddleback, right as we were approaching the summit we got clouded out and bye bye went the views. Still a great time though. Also the first pic is my pack I will be carrying for 2000+ miles who says you need a huge bag to go into the woods, I‚Äôm more then comfortable with my 7.5 pounds of gear (not including food and water). Right now I am sitting in a rose garden mooching WiFi from a library and enjoying the small town of Rangeley, Maine :) Happy trails!! #atsobo2018

Bullwinkle is 22 years old and from Scotland. He has spotted two moose so far, so I suggested that his trail name should be Bullwinkle. He has no idea who Bullwinkle is, which I find hilarious.<br><br>#at2018 #atsobo2018 #maine #100milewilderness #crawfordpond #fortrelief&nbsp;#hearteyesontheAT

After climbing over White Cap, Hay Mountain, West Peak, Gulf Hagas, The Chairbacks, and Barren Mountain we were seriously dragging. The first 5-miles of that day felt like 50 and we were pushing to a 15-Mile day. When we came across Long Pond Stream we heard the sound of the falls and we boogied even faster. We threw our packs off and jumped in the water and in that moment all of the pain and worry of the day washed away. We doused ourselves with peppermint Dr. Bronners to wash the salty sweat and we spent about two hours exploring this incredible falls and river.

I am formally announcing my intent to challenge the self-supported FKT for the Appalachian Trail. My hike will begin at Mt. Katahdin in Maine on June 27th and I will continue southbound (SOBO) until I reach Springer Mountain in Georgia. The record is currently held by Joe ‚ÄúStringbean‚Äù McConaughy (@thestring.bean) who finished the 2,191 miles in 45d 12h 15m last August. He did a phenomenal job and leaves a daunting legacy. I am dedicating this hike to Marine Sergeant Jacob ‚ÄúJake‚Äù Pope who lost his left leg to an IED while serving in Afghanistan. He will move into his adapted home built by Homes for Our Troops next week. I am also hoping to raise awareness and funding for this great organization. If you feel so moved, please contribute at: https://www.myhfotusa.org/ATChallenge.<br><br>You can follow my journey using the following link and PW: https://share.garmin.com/EricStrumpf / ATFKT2018<br><br>I will provide occasional updates via Instagram but will focus primarily on moving down the trail. There is a rich history of hard-charging endurance athletes and AT ambassadors who have advanced this challenge to what it is today. It is with great respect and humility that I make this attempt. Best wishes to all!

Ever since I went hiking on the Long Trail in Vermont I‚Äôve felt the universe pulling me towards the Appalachian Trail. The stars aligned and I felt like I kept seeing signs every day reminding me and telling me that I should be hiking. I don‚Äôt know what the next 6 months are going to look like or what is going to happen after and it‚Äôs hard not to want to plan out every minute detail, but I am so at peace and confident with my decision and I truly believe everything else will work itself out.
