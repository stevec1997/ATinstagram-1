No matter what crazy distance goals they set themselves, or what the trail threw at them, they never once said enough. When they announced their intention to complete the final thousand miles in 36 days I was sure it was more that they were capable of. It wasn‚Äôt. Yet there were days when I would have happily thrown in the towel. Over the endless climbs and weeks of rain, as the trail chipped away at me, it only made them stronger.<br><br>Looking back now, what I learned most from 2,000 miles with F&B, was never to assume that my limitations define their limitations (thankfully they don‚Äôt). Recently this lesson has seemed all the more apposite, because whether its kids who hike, or kids who strike for our climate, it‚Äôs clear they can aspire to, and achieve more than many are willing to give them credit for.

To start, there are now three types of backpacks you can choose from:<br><br>Normal 5 pound packs: This is usually the cheapest pack you can afford however, you can really get some solid packs that work for you. These heavy packs have all the creature comforts to enjoy your adventure.<br><br>Light 2.5 to 3 pound packs: These packs are usually your second pack you ever purchase and they are usually between $150 to $350 USD. They are still very comfortable to wear and pack great comforts. These are the best bang for the buck packs out there.<br>Lighter than 2.5 pound packs: These packs are usually bare bones but some still offer a range of comforts.  Pricing can be over $150 to $600 USD. These are the best of the best, but because of the light material used, handle with care. Examples are Osprey, Gregory, @zpacks, @hyperlite_mountain_gear, @gossamergear, @ulaequipment, @sixmoondesigns, and other various pack companies.<br><br>In closing, shop around for deals and wait for the sales. On average, if you can get a pack from 2 to 2.75 pounds for around $180 USD, you are way ahead of the base weight game.<br><br>https://cnocoutdoors.com/blogs/blog/pads-packs-hikingsailor<br><br>Clickable link in bio.<br><br>#backpacking #CnocOutdoors #AT2018 #thruhike #thruhiking #neverstopexploring  #atsobo2018 #AT2019 #ATclassof2019 #thetrailspeaks #hikingsailortips #sleepingpads #rvalues"

Here's some advice from @the_hiking_sailor_at2019.<br>****<br>Good day, SOBOs. During my 772 mile hike on the Appalachian Trail in 2018, I thought I would share my experience in the first AT SOBO 450 miles. This region is in my backyard.<br>Tip #1 :Getting past Katahdin.  It is the hardest mountain on the whole AT, it seems, but I beg to differ, as you are going to be surprised at the many other challenges like Kelly‚Äôs Knob. But it is hard and for most of you, the time needed to climb up and down will take 8 hours. NOBOs can hike up and down in a very easy 3.5 hours.<br>Things that you can do to make things easier includes carrying a day pack up (Slackpacking it is called). You can exchange your pack with a day pack at the ranger station. Bring gloves, long pants, 3 liters of water, snacks, an extra jacket and clothing for element changes.<br><br>#Slackpacking #CnocOutdoors #AT2018 #AppalachianTrail #thruhike #thruhiking #neverstopexploring #katahdin #Maine #atsobo2018 #AT2019 #ATclassof2019 #thetrailspeaks #hikingsailortips"
