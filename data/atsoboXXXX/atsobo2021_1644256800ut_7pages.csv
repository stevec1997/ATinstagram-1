It was socked in up at 5,000 feet and cleared as we made our way down. Amy was coming down to visit Walk and slack us for a couple days so we made it down the mountain and walked by the VA Creeper Trail for a while before Amy picked us up and we went back to the house for the night. The AirBnB was a cool little cabin in Damascus. We relaxed and got ready for a big day coming. <br><br>Day 140 ‚ÄúTennessee‚Äù<br>Miles - 27.2<br>MM - 1716.8 to 1744.0<br><br>First thing in the morning, we set out to get some slackpacking miles in.  We had a hill to get up and over before we walked through Damascus. On the way out of Damascus, we had a decent climb back to elevation. We crossed into TN about 2/3 of the way through the climb, which ended the longest state on the trail. VA was beautiful and a grind to get through. The rest of the day we cruised to an open field that we ended on the south side of. This was my longest hiking day on trail to this point in time. On our way down, we had a beautiful sunset and once we got to the van, I drove back to the house and we resupplied for the coming days. <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>#appalachaintrail #atsobo #thruhike #appalachaintrail2021 #atsobo2021 #thruhike2021 #mainetogeorgia #atclassof2021"

We walked by a closed visitors center, and ate lunch at a really nice shelter in the sun.  It was a bit warmer during the day.  We hiked the last 3 or 4 miles in the dark, and the last hill was a bit of a butt kicker, but we made camp around 7. <br><br>Day 138 ‚ÄúGrayson Highlands‚Äù<br>Miles - 20.2<br>MM - 1678.0 to 1698.2<br><br>First thing in the morning, we started up the remainder of Hurricane Mountain. After that climb and descent, we walked gradually uphill to an open field above 5,000 feet.  This was the first time we‚Äôve been above 5k since Mt. Lafayette in NH. We cruised in some open fields and finally into Grayson Highlands.  We stayed above 5k for the majority of the day and enjoyed some of the best views in Virginia. The other highlight of the Grayson Highlands are the wild ponies, which we saw all day as well. We came down past Mt. Rogers, the highest peak in VA, at about dark and set up camp on the South side of a parking lot. We had a lot of activity in the area overnight.  Starting around 10ish the coyotes were howling and it was extremely loud. We also had a lot of people stopping in the parking lot by us. I had a horrible night of sleep, but enjoyed the sounds of the night. <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>#appalachaintrail #atsobo #thruhike #appalachaintrail2021 #atsobo2021 #thruhike2021 #mainetogeorgia #atclassof2021"

There was really nothing of note during our hiking day aside from the final climb that got rocky towards the top. We had a long ride back to the hostel and had a great conversation with Julie, the owner.  We had spaghetti for dinner and after dinner talked with two other SOBOs who were in a tough spot in their hike.  Dave broke his shoulder in a fall and they were trying to figure out how to potentially slackpack to the end.  In the middle of talking after dinner, we heard an old voice come in the front door. Our buddy, Too Late, showed up.  We haven‚Äôt seen him since Bennington, VT. We talked and caught up and went to bed. <br><br>Day 135 ‚ÄúBear Garden Night‚Äù<br>Miles - 17.8<br>MM - 1617.1 to 1634.9<br><br>We had a long ride to the trailhead from Weary Feet and we had some great conversation with Robert about hunting in VA basically the whole way.  During the hiking day, we had three climbs. The first of which was up to Chestnut Knob Shelter which was a cool, fully enclosed stone shelter.  After this we walked in some open balds for a while and had great views.  The next few climbs were steeper and we moved through them and headed into Bear Garden Hostel for the night. Dave and Melissa were there continuing their slackpack adventure, and Too Late showed up later in the evening.  We ate a bunch of food from the freezer and had a very comfortable night inside. <br><br>Day 136 ‚ÄúResupply at a Sunoco‚Äù<br>Miles - 17.1<br>MM - 1634.9 to 1652.0<br><br>We headed out of bear garden with Too Late back in the crew.  We planned a shorter and easier day to resupply for our push to Damascus. The hiking was pretty easy and we made it to a Sunoco station that had the snacks we needed to resupply and a bunch of food to eat while we were there. We headed up the mountain to the shelter for the night with full packs ready to finish off the highlands in VA in the coming days. <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>#appalachaintrail #atsobo #thruhike #appalachaintrail2021 #atsobo2021 #thruhike2021 #mainetogeorgia #atclassof2021"

Over the years, particularly in the last three, in my continuing trend of uprooting my life every three to six months for a thru-hike or a new job or an escape framed as a mental reset, I‚Äôve gotten pretty used to drastic lifestyle changes. Burlington has been a big transition. I‚Äôm missing smaller places. Big sunrises <br>‚Ä¢<br>Cities with lots of stoplights and corporate corner stores and more than one main road have always left me homesick for little towns with dirt roads running through them and just a few stop signs, but not too many.

Us hiker trash usually end up nodding, not needing words, knowing together this secret world.<br>‚Ä¢<br>Rad and I pushed a single-day Presidential traverse. It was miserably wet, cold, and quiet. Besides the roar of raindrops and swirling wind, it was silent on the mountain.<br>‚Ä¢<br>I had become accustomed to clouds consuming the White Mountain vistas after that week. We imagined their glory but witnessed only clouds and trees. We had no energy to talk above the wind and we dragged our pruned feet over the wet rocks. <br>‚Ä¢<br>Later, while hiking up Mt. Lafayette, we realized we were no longer shrouded in clouds. We could see more than 100 feet ahead for the first time in New Hampshire!<br>‚Ä¢<br>I about cried with relief, and all I mustered was, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt realize how miserable I‚Äôve been.‚Äù<br>‚Ä¢<br>Soon, we were buzzing with joy, vibrating and running laps around each other, taking photos and whooping excitedly. My soul warmed. We ran up to the summit to peer down on Franconia Ridge - one of the most famous views along the AT. Drifting clouds rolled over the ridge, cloaking the view and revealing it again. The fog danced and wrapped itself around ledges and little towers. Tiny people way way off in the distance disappeared into momentary voids.<br>‚Ä¢<br>One can become more grateful for five minutes of sunshine after a week rain than was ever before imaginable.

In under 12 miles, it was pretty uphill most of the way.  We got some good views up top of the valley and didn‚Äôt really take much time off hiking.  When we got to Woods Hole, my new shoes and pack arrived.  My shoes were done and my joints had started to hurt about 70 miles ago. My pack wasn‚Äôt big enough to comfortably carry my winter gear and additional food, so my new Hyperlite pack should do the trick.

We didn‚Äôt know what to expect for dinner, but the owner, Julie made an awesome Thanksgiving dinner for us.  Super thankful for her and the hostel today.

Around 8:30 we got on trail. The beginning of the day was an easy, protected climb up to a ridge line.  Once we hit the top, we could hear the wind howling on the other side of the mountain. Basically the remainder of the day was spent on the ridge line on the windy side of the mountain.  It was cold and the wind was blowing hard enough to blow my trekking poles side to side as we walked. We had exactly 0 views on the day and the ridge line was filled with PUDs. It was a day that we hustled and only took one small break to eat.

We shared stories, sang happy birthday, and considered what to carry into the Smokies and what to mail home. When the rain seemed to stop, some of us stayed and some of us hiked on. As I climbed up into the park in the rain and the dark I realized I had broken my rule. I didn‚Äôt hug everyone goodbye. You see, one should always hug their friends goodbye because they might not see them down the trail. My heart sunk.<br><br>We had never been together like this before and this group was never all together again. And that is beautiful. The impermanence of these interactions makes the moments we shared that much more meaningful.<br><br>I did see each of these hikers again and I did get my last hugs in, some with a little trail left to hike and others in celebration of all the trail that was now behind us.

One month. It feels like six. <br><br>I miss the trail. I miss the good and the bad bits. The constant pushing of my limits, mental and physical. The views-even the overcast ones-they are magical too, in their own way. Being outside, in nature, 24/7. Falling asleep and waking up to the sound of the critters in the forest. I miss the people. The common goal and support we shared with each other. The complex simplicity of trail life. <br><br>There hasn't been a day in the past month that I haven't thought about the hike. It will forever be a part of me. Lessons learned, friendships made, challenges met. The realization that anything is possible, if I am determined enough. Finding truth in the statement: The fears I do not face become my limits. <br><br>I've also struggled with 'feeling' the hike over the past month. What I have come to believe is that I had expectations that once I finished the hike I would have an overwhelming feeling of accomplishment, joy and fulfillment. Expectations are often a doozy. Instead I now realize I had those feelings almost everyday while I was on trail. Each day was an accomplishment. Hitting my miles for the day, catching a sunset/sunrise, getting that hitch into/out of town. <br><br>And then it came to an abrupt end. I am grateful that my body carried me 2193.1 miles, but I wasn't relieved it was over. Why would I feel joy at the end of something so wonderful? <br><br>Those feelings I expected do come in very small waves, most often when I look back through the photos.

Wow, the Smokies delivered though! ‚õ∞‚õ∞<br>.<br>Mid March of this year I found myself out on these same miles leading up to the Smoky Mountains on a training hike I was doing for these two thru hikes. I had connected with a friend who was just beginning his northbound AT thru, and I really was feeling all the feels. Just a month later I would set off on the CDT, and it seemed like an impossible eternity before I would walk this same section of trail, headed the other direction. Doubt was sweeping in fast. Not just at the longevity of it all, but the realization that I would probably be doing most of it alone. <br>.<br>Since the beginning of this journey, I have viewed the Smoky Mountains as something of a final checkpoint. Almost an elusive and seemingly unattainable goal ‚Ä¶ the last obstacle before the end. Catching those first views of layered mountains, endlessly folding over each other like a giant blue blanket, tears sprung unbidden to my eyes. I had made it. And though I was indeed alone, I felt as if I was in the best company in the world. <br>.<br>On the heels of that elation, the stark realization of this trip‚Äôs finality came rushing in. This WAS it. And how was I going to finish it? How can you finish it? Sitting in these beautiful but conflicting feelings in this final week ‚Ä¶ and trying to finish with peace and closure.

I‚Äôve found that there are 2 types of hikers this late in the game: the ones that are looking forward to the end and the others that don‚Äôt want the journey to be over. Most long distance hikers will tell you that they usually feel a combination of the two, but one side typically pulls harder than the other depending on individual-specific variables.<br><br>Onward fits in the latter category and we discussed the challenges of finishing the trail and re-entry into ‚Äúnormal‚Äù everyday life. For her and myself, the fear of having to come back far outweighs the anxiety and anticipation of starting a trek like this. Challenges like having to secure a source of income, maybe moving to a new place, and sometimes developing completely new social circles all the while trying to avoid the pitfalls of your old life that drove you to the trail in the first place can seem overwhelming. Most thru hikers turn their lives upside down to chase this dream and ensuring a smooth post-trail transition can help to reduce the post-trail blues. Talking about this helps me just as much or more than the hikers I talk to and I‚Äôm grateful for the opportunity to meet and speak with Onward and all of the other hikers from this year.<br><br>Congrats to Onward for making it this far and to her inevitable successful completion of this thru hike!

As we came up one of the last knobs we ran right into a bear about 30 yards from us. My first thought was it was someone‚Äôs dog in the woods, but instantly knew it was a bear. It didn‚Äôt seem overly concerned with us as we were close to some houses and it likely wanted a meal from the trash. We slowly moved past the bear and kept rolling. Our last two miles were in the dark and slow over the rocks, but we made camp and set up quickly with a warm night ahead.

The cold slowly takes over as fall morphs into winter, stripping the trees and chilling the air. It‚Äôs an intimidating reality, but the gradual shift has been a beautiful display of diversity and natural alteration. It‚Äôs been pretty wild to be immersed in each stage of these mountain‚Äôs yearly evolution. <br>.<br>Climbing from the rolling hills and farmland of the mid-Atlantic, up into Shenandoah National Park, we started to realize that fall was quickly dissipating. Leaves tumbled around us, and the forest rapidly thinned into naked, twisted branches against a cold sky. Though the magical colors we had been moving through were leaving, new views and scenes opened up as we got clearer windows to the broader world around us. Through the skeleton trees, the contours of endless mountains began to take shape, and instead of just getting expansive views once or twice a day, we were looking out at massive landscapes from within the forest. A subtle but beautiful gift of winter. <br>.<br>Despite the cold, we are holding up well, and still getting the miles done we were hoping to. Ahead lies Greyson Highlands, and the Smokies, through which we will probably hit some significant snow, and harder terrain.

Dolittle's injury, entering the American health care system, and the subsequent wrangling with insurance has been just one facet of the stress of returning to civilian life. The sudden end and non-completion of a goal that's been years in the making is just devastating. The hole in our lives where the trail had been these past months is gaping and impossible to fill. Other thru hikers will know, but it's hard to get across how much spending an extended time in the woods changes you physiologically, emotionally, and socially. How can you replace the daily endorphin rush from crushing miles and climbing mountains? How can you avoid feeling overwhelmed by yr soundtrack changing from the song of the wind in the trees to the cacophony of modern life?

We stopped at the ATC to get our pictures taken and started hiking into the clouds that remained from the rain yesterday.  We made it across the Shenandoah river and bounced between WV and VA a few times.  The terrain remained rocky, but we made pretty decent time rolling ahead to camp. We entered the rollercoaster in VA which is a series of climbs and descents that are one after the other for 13 miles or so. We had planned to get to Bears Den for the night and ran out of daylight about 3 miles out.  We hiked into the hostel in the dark which was a cool stone castle in the middle of the rollercoaster.  It was an awesome stay, for $35 we got a bed, laundry, shower, frozen pizza, ice cream, and a soda‚Ä¶.not too bad.

This was a section I did almost exactly 4 years ago, taking about 10 days to complete. My friend Sofie, who I met on the Colorado Trail, lives near Franklin and shuttled me to Springer and then Fontana. This time around, she picked us up from Tellico gap. First we walked 29 miles non-stop from Fontana to NOC, 8 am to 6 pm in the cold and rain. This probably set a new record in death marching for me but was worth it to achieve a warm, dry place for the night. My kayaking friend from Miami, Donna, picked us up from the NOC to deliver us to her beautiful cabin in the woods, where a hot meal of beef stew filled our bellies and replenished our souls. I could not have asked for a better ending to compensate for a hard day...when it's raining for days, what else you gonna do? Not hike in the rain? Not us. <br><br>We began the second day with smaller expectations. 23 miles tuned into 8 thanks to the persistent rain and multiple options to get into Franklin. Sofie hiked up the trail a bit to meet us and it was great to get to walk with her again, if only too short. That makes 2 CT tramily members that have hiked on the AT with me this year, the other being @yoyo_onthe_trail <br>We had a great stay with Arthur and Sofie in their new and amazing house and also visited my favorite trail brewery, the Lazy Hiker. Outdoor 76, a fantastic outfitter store and Sofie's previous employer, hooked me up with an AT patch and even printed the CDT and PCT logos so I could decorate my Triple Crown. Burger King provided the crown. We had fun watching all the kids strut around downtown in their Halloween costumes. I sadly went dressed as a hiker. Later we had a wonderful meal of black bean soup and cornbread... comfort food, much needed for the cold. Thanks so much to Donna and Sofie for sharing their lovely homes with us and feeding us some delicious home-cooked meals.<br>Sunday was back to business, with the clouds finally breaking mid-day to reveal the spectre of colors from Wayah bald. Similar grandness was had at Alberts Fire tower the next morning. Then on into GA, 14th, pretty uneventful for the next 3 days. The end.<br>#atsobo2021"

We ate lunch at the base of Bear Mountain and I drank a couple cokes before heading up.  We crushed the mountain southbound, which was really cool as it was almost all rock steps. There were also signs and info on all sorts of different trails and ways to maintain a trail. At the top, we relaxed for a few minutes and headed back down.  The south side of the mountain was a little less pristine and tougher hiking, but we got it done and hit our 1000 mile mark on the trail.  Once we made it to the shelter for the night, we decided to head down to a road crossing to go into a hotel. This ended up being more of an adventure than we anticipated. When we got to the road we had absolutely no service, so we couldn‚Äôt get a ride.  It was also very dark by this point to add to our challenges. I threw out my trusty thumb and in the first set of cars that drove by, a dude in a Miata stopped and asked if we needed a ride.  Obviously, 3 guys weren‚Äôt fitting in the car so I just asked for a ride to a spot with service and jumped in. He took me up the mountain and I got an Uber ordered.

Even though I've hiked through them before, as well as done several shorter hikes when I first started backpacking, there were still new things to see and do. This time I passed the 2000 mile mark on the AT and I finally got to see views from Clingmans Dome, highpoint of the AT. I was 0 for 2 on previous attempts. And I hiked the 77 miles though the park in 3 days...a section that took me 5 days in 2017. A big part of the fast push was to beat some weather and take advantage of one day of superb conditions. The first day was pretty much a wash, fogged in and mostly all climbing from Davenport Gap to a nearly full shelter at Pecks corner. It was very cold but thankfully the rain let up mid day. The next day brought frost on the ridge but clear skies. We did our longest day, 29 miles, to see as much as we could. Charlies bunion, trail magic at Newfound gap, and Clingmans dome were all on the agenda. Tourists abounded until past the dome, then all went quiet. We got to Derricks knob shelter right at dusk, relieved to find only one other person. A cold wind blew dust all over us as we slept overnight and I left early to try to beat the rain the 3rd day. I got some cool views of a red sky from Rocky Top, battling gusts of 50 mph on top. Tree branches were crashing down all around me and even the leaves stung when they whipped into my face. I climbed the rickety Shuckstack fire tower, feeling it violently sway and shudder in the wind. The views were worth the terrifying ride  Then finally on across the famous Fontana dam, a walk I'd done several times before but this time brought tears to me eye for all the good memories. The rain started and I inhaled 2.5 burritos at Fresh Ground's setup, my first full-blown, on trail cookout of trail magic after 8 thru hikes...a perfect day and series of accomplishments for such a reward. #purplerainskirts #atsobo2021"

Bacon, pancakes, eggs, potatoes and of course all the fresh ground coffee. And a beautiful lake sunrise too. We have a fast day hiking fueled from real food and we meet Fresh Grounds at a road crossing where he takes us into town to resupply and then cooks us other amazing meal of fried chicken and stir fry. And then he sets up his projector and we cuddle in the cold with hot cocoa and watch a movie projected on the van. Another day of being blessed by this trail and it's people. <br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #zebratales"

We hiked up to Bake Oven Knob, Wolf Rocks, and the Knife‚Äôs Edge and spent the majority of the day on rocks of all sizes. Our feet were really beat up so we got a late lunch at the Thunderhead Lodge restaurant and got a room at a nice BnB for the night.  We stayed at the Shanty at Blue Mountain, which was a beautiful homestead owned by a sweet lady.  We watched some football, showered, did some laundry, and played cards. <br><br>Day 81 ‚ÄúLong Day in the Rain‚Äù<br>Miles - 20.6<br>MM - 946.7 to 967.3<br><br>The humidity came back in overnight. We had a great breakfast at The Shanty of bacon, eggs, and blueberry pancakes and got a ride back to the trail around 8. It started raining on us around 10:30, and continued for about an hour and a half.  It was another flat hiking day in PA with one easy climb in the middle. We stopped at the Eckville Shelter in the middle of the day to eat lunch and started our climb to the Pinnacle.  It cleared on our way up and we had great views at the top. We made it down off the mountain and go into camp around 5:45. <br><br>Day 82 ‚ÄúSide Trip to Cabelas‚Äù<br>Miles - 14.7<br>MM - 967.3 to 982.0<br><br>The hiking was incredibly boring today aside from a short, but very steep climb out of Port Clinton. We took a side trip to Hamburg in the middle of the day to walk through Cabelas, grab some food from Micky D‚Äôs, and hit Walmart for some odds and ends. We made it into camp around 6 after messing around in town for a few hours. We met a SOBO flip flopper, Hitch at the shelter.  I recognized him from the Barn Hostel in Gorham. The thru hiking community is a pretty small group and I have remembered most of the people we met in one way or another. There were also two NOBO section hikers in camp, and one of them got lost on the way to the privy and had to call the fire department to get him back. It was an exciting night in camp to say the least!<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>#appalachaintrail #atsobo #thruhike #appalachaintrail2021 #atsobo2021 #thruhike2021 #mainetogeorgia #atclassof2021"

We then dipped back down into the valley to traverse the other side to scramble up to Dragon's Tooth; aptly named with it's cool rock structure.<br><br>These hikes can be done all as one as an epic endurance challenge, but most people treat each one separately as the equivalent of taking a day to climb Moel Famau or Scafell.

After the rain, the day is clear and cold. The cold is great for the climbs, but bone-chilling every time we stop. The leaves are still gorgeous, we can't believe we picked such a great time of year to be here. We camp outside another host's house and they feed us dinner and dessert and we meet so many amazing people. I even meet a guy who hiked the PCT and is now opening a hot dog and ice cream stand for hikers on the AT. We end the night with a hot fire and stay up til midnight talking. We plan to get up early the next day, but accidentally sleep in and rush to pack up quickly when we finally wake up and practically run a couple miles to get up to watch the sunrise on Max Patch. We make it just as the light is turning colors and enjoy a gorgeous breakfast watching the sunrise and huddling together to stay warm. We book it up and over ridgetops and have a long downhill to Standing Bear Hostel where we stop in for a quick resupply and to charge our stuff. As always, it's a long climb out of all the hostels and the cold day is much appreciated. We enter the Smoky Mountains, a much awaited part of the trail and get to a busy hut at dusk.

Homemade dinner, warm beds, and a hot shower. We even manage to break the toilet somehow (can't take thru-hikers anywhere).

Apparently, this section of trail previously involved a ten-mile road walk, so even though there are some pretty tedious, rocky ups and downs, it's better than yellow blazing and nothing that any SOBO hiker hasn't done dozens of times thru New England. Any minor inconvenience is negated by the absolutely delightfully cruisey, smooth trail over the rolling NoVA hills.

We finally pull ourselves away from the hostel to resupply at the dollar store and each grab our own Little Caesar's pizza or two. Been at least 10 years since I've had one. Either my hiker hunger is in full force or they have upped their pizza game. The next day we make pancakes from food we find in the hiker box. We wander around all the stores we can to buy all the food we don't need. But a hiker can never have too much crappy food.

These miles haven‚Äôt been coming super easily, as the trail has gotten easier it‚Äôs still very up and down and the mud is brutal.  The following day we hiked a hard day to the top of Killington Mountain. We stayed in the worst shelter we‚Äôve stayed in at Cooper Lodge. It poured rain and just about every spot on the roof leaked. We laid out some tarps and had a restless night of sleep. The next day we walked about 11 miles and stayed in Rutland, VT to dry all of our gear (especially the sleeping bags) out. As my ankle deteriorated, I had to get new shoes the next day. Luckily, Rutland had a nice shoe store and I switched to Hokas from my Altras. They gave me a lot more cushion and my ankle immediately felt better hiking. Walk and I did about 12 miles out of town after noon that day.  We stayed in a beautiful shelter called Little Rock Pond Shelter.  It was cold that night, but awesome.  We walked a long, almost 18 mile day yesterday to set up an easy hike into Manchester Center.  The mud and puds (pointless ups and downs) have been draining in Vermont.  For much of this section the trail has been extremely muddy. They‚Äôve gotten over 15 inches of rain since the beginning of July in Vermont. It has been similar to hiking in sand as you can‚Äôt get traction on anything.  We made it into town and got some much needed showers. My ankle is healing up nicely in newer shoes, it appears as though I waited too long to replace shoes with worn out midsoles; won‚Äôt be making that mistake again.  Only 56 miles left in Vermont and we all can‚Äôt wait to hit the Mass border to get away from this mud.

We were up and down from road crossings until we met Amy on the other side of our last mountain. She and Walk rented an AirBnB for Sunday and Monday and we will be zeroing.

We were pretty proud that it took us 4 days to complete. Started the roller coaster of Virginia, which proved to be much easier than all the NOBOs told us it would be as it always is. Found a sweet spot to camp and watched an epic sunset. Watched shooting stars and finally had an epically clear night sky to stargaze. The guys started their self-inflicted pushup challenge, because thru hiking isn't hard enough. The next day was more roller coaster action, getting stung by a bee while admiring the 1000 miles to Springer Mountain sign.

The border of NH and VT was on a bridge over the Connecticut River and we stopped for some pictures before moving along. Mock showed us around his hometown, or at least what touches the AT. After the road walk, he headed out and we pressed on our short day to camp.  The trail was very different in this section, with very few rocks and gradual inclines.

We hit our last hut on trail for an awesome oatmeal bar thing and some water and rolled out. It started raining on us shortly after we started up and we didn‚Äôt have much for views on top. The way down was steep for a short period. It kind of reminded me of Maine with some steep slabs of rock to traverse.  Once down, we had another mountain to tackle on the day which was an obnoxiously long up and down climb up to Mt. Wolf.  At the top, Walk and I got poured on until we made it just before the parking lot. We got through it and had over 11k feet of up and down on the day. For us, any day over 10k is pretty brutal.

Had a nice breakfast at the hut of oatmeal, eggs, and sausage. Talked with a few folks who were section hiking and northbound on the AT.  Tons of people were out doing the Pemi Loop and I spent most of breakfast talking with another hiker who hurt her ankle the day before and came into the hut late the night before. She got me thinking about tackling the 4ks in NH after this hike. After a bit too much talking and stalling on the hike, I headed out to get over Garfield, Lafayette, and down into Franconia Notch. It was cold. I sweated through my clothes by the time I made it halfway up Garfield and the wind was making it even colder.  I stopped at the shelter to warm up with some coffee and snacks as I didn‚Äôt plan on stopping for the remainder of the day. The top of Garfield was beautiful, but full of people, so I grabbed some pictures and moved on.  After a couple of miles I started the climb up Mt. Lafayette, our last 5000 ft peak until the South. Saw a bunch of NOBOs and false peaks up Lafayette. The north side of the mountain was all new to me, but I did hike the ridge last year. The views didn‚Äôt disappoint, but there were a ton of people up top and I took a few pictures and headed down to Mt. Lincoln and then down to Franconia Ridge.

Met a lot of nice people and finally started running into more southbounders. Another hurricane hit and I spent half a day walking through a river of a trail and a downpour to make it to the coolest old mansion of a hostel. I holed up with a little crew and we read and played games with our headlamps after the power went out.

The only caveat was that I couldn‚Äôt get to the trailhead until after 8:30. It was going to be hard to catch the guys with such a late start, but I‚Äôll try. I started out up the mountain and stopped at each water source along the way. I felt much better the more hydrated I was. After the initial climb, the trail was flat for about 5 miles which was a nice reprieve. At the end of the flat section I came across some cliffs near Zealand Mountain and they were gorgeous.  I got to the first hut and spent way too much time talking to a couple of NOBOs - Cowboy and Badger.  About an hour and a half later I left and started up Zealand Mountain.  After the initial incline, the uphills were fairly forgiving.  I spent much of the remainder of the day going up, culminating at the top of South Twin Mountain.  I think this was the prettiest view on the entire trail thus far, with what felt like all of the Whites in view. I spent too much time up top and decided to go into the hut that evening as I wouldn‚Äôt make the campsite before 9:30ish. I had a good dinner, rehydrated, and talked to a few hikers before bed. <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #atsobo #thruhike #appalachaintrail2021 #atsobo2021 #thruhike2021 #mainetogeorgia #hikenewhampshire"

The AT kind of wraps around many of the peaks in the Presidentials as opposed to going to the top, but we still do climb a fair amount on the way. We walked around Mt. Adams, Mt. Jefferson, and started up around Mt. Clay on the way to Mt. Washington.  The ground was almost all rocks and we were very fortunate to have such a nice day. It definitely was worth the few days off for this weather.  The humidity has been really high since we started in the Presidentials and the climbs have been killing me.  On our ascent up to Washington, the Cog Train that runs to the top goes right by the trail and those folks were all in for a treat watching me struggle to the top.  I figured they wouldn‚Äôt remember me anyway, but a lady came up to me when I was on top of Washington and said they all saw me working hard coming up the mountain.  We got some food at the concession stand at the top of the mountain and made our way back down.  Thankfully on the south side of the mountain the rocks subsided a bit.  We filled up our water at Lake of the Clouds and pressed on toward Mizpah Hut.  We passed Mt. Monroe and Mt. Eisenhower and didn‚Äôt take the side trips to the top. The hike was a slow, flat grind until Mt. Pierce which was on trail and a small climb and steep descent into camp. Once in camp, I set up to cowboy camp since it was clear and enjoyed a good nights rest after one of our harder days on trail.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #atsobo #thruhike #appalachaintrail2021 #atsobo2021 #thruhike2021 #mainetogeorgia #hikenewhampshire"

This took me a while and was probably the hardest climb we‚Äôve had to date. Katahdin was technically more difficult with tougher rock scrambles, but this was steeper than that hike.

It was very difficult and I walked most of the way down with Layers as we were all going to the same place that night. Too Late got an AirBnB for us to stay in that night in Berlin.

Temps shot back up today and boy was it warm. As I get closer to Pennsylvania, the trail gets rockier. I don't know how it can get any rockier, but somehow it does. Pennsylvania is also called Rocksylvania on the AT, so apparently it's going to get even worse. It was so hot that food sounded horrible. I had to force myself to eat throughout the day. I walked along the Delaware River and walked into Pennsylvania. Saw a bear, the third I've seen in trail. I get excited to see bears so I told a group of weekend warrior college kids in passing that I had just seen one and to be on the lookout. Bad idea. They were not so excited. I spent a little while reaffirming them that they would be fine and with as much noise as they were making he would probably be long gone by now. I've seen a bunch of smaller snakes, but finally saw a big one today. I thought it was a stick at first and almost kicked it out of the trail. Glad I didn't. Pushed my longest day yet and was glad to let me feet rest from rock stumbling when I finally stopped for the day. <br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #backpacknewyork #backpackpennsylvania #zebratales"

I feel like I haven't been dreaming much recently, I think because I usually wake up so much throughout the night when I'm camping. It was the first time in awhile that I didn't wake before my alarm went off at 6:30. I definitely needed that sleep. Our wonderful pastor host made us pancakes and coffee and we had the most delightful morning with him and his family. Seriously the most comfortable, loving, and homey hostel experience I have had. Feeling very thankful. We set off on the trail and the post-hurricane weather was thankfully a little windier than normal which really helped cut down on the humidity. A pretty morning with flowers and butterflies and a rocky afternoon. Passed by a veterans memorial for the high point in New Jersey. Laughed at a ridiculously obvious privy sign. Walked hard after a late start and made it to camp round dusk. The camp had a wonderful spring with the coldest and most refreshing water!! Now the birds are going crazy as they seem to do most nights.

I finally took a day off. Or a zero as we call it in the thru-hiking community. I was waiting on a package in the mail and there was that hurricane going on apparently, so it seemed like a good enough reason to take a break. I had the best night's sleep I have had on the entire trail. I sat outside the country store and ate breakfast on the porch and watched the little town wake up. It was so relaxing. It really made me miss living in a small town. My entire goal for the day was to walk as little as possible and eat as much as possible. I read and stretched and did some yoga and picked up a package I had my mom sent out with a new shirt and sports bra since mine were starting to disintegrate. I couldn't bear to throw away my tshirt since it was the same one I wore on my first thru hike so I sent the holey, smelly thing home. Sorry mom. I tried to eat some vegetables along with as many calories as I could get, but my body just doesn't know what to do with excess calories anymore and stuffing my face proved harder than expected. A few other hikers showed up at the hostel and what do you know, three SOBOs!!! I haven't seen any in a while so it was a pleasant surprise. My feet were looking pretty puffy by the end of the day, they just don't even know what to do when they're not walking all day.

I keep telling myself I'm gonna start buying less shit-food, but how does one say no to frosted sticky buns when you're starving? And just look at the calories in that thing! Laughed at the bathroom that had a TV in it... in a gas station of all places. Felt much more fueled hiking out with a full belly. Crossed over the Hudson River and then walked through a zoo, a very touristy park and lake, and up Bear Mountain. Walking by so many people in nice clean, white clothes who smelled good. The zoo was quite hilarious, seeing all the animals in cages that I see while hiking. I can see why there are the number of bear encounters there are when people go to a zoo and see a cute bear just laying around, not the least bit scared or threatened by people, which would never happen in the wild. It was actually pretty sad because seeing a bear in the wild is one of the most amazing things and seeing them in a cage was like seeing a pet dog. Had fun playing frogger running across a busy interstate. I forgot how fast cars drive! Hiked all the crazy and rocky up and downs today. It's fairly dry in this section, so I finally have to start planning out where I'm getting water a little more carefully. It didn't even rain today which was a nice break, although I know it's just a teaser before the hurricane hits me tomorrow or the next day.

The crew for this day was Walk, Hot Sauce, Too Late, and me. We started the morning with a short climb to the top of the Mahoosuc Arm. I twisted my ankle and ate it walking around the pond first thing in the morning, great start to the day. When we got up top we had the most amazing views of the mountains in Maine and New Hampshire. The rain from yesterday completely cleared and it was a perfect day. Mt. Washington is imposing and continues to get closer to us. We then started the descent down the Mahoosuc arm.  This was absolutely brutal, at some points the rocks we were sliding down seemed straight up and down.  It took us a while to get that done. Then we headed into the Mahoosuc Notch which is a mile of Boulder scrambling that is known as the hardest and slowest mile on the AT. It was an absolute blast. We climbed and crawled our way through boulders, caves, and rocks for an hour and a half and it was over. We all had fun and the next climb showed us just how much energy we used getting through the notch.  After that climb, we had a bunch more up and down remaining.  I took a really bad spill on one of the descents, and got very lucky my knees landed on soft ground. I did a lot more sliding down on my rear end after that one. The Goose Eye Mountains contained a lot of ladders, rock scrambling, and overall sketchy climbing and descending, but we finally made it to the shelter around 5.  We were all wrecked when we got into camp, which is a half mile from the New Hampshire border. Maine certainly won‚Äôt let us go without a fight, but this was one of the most challenging and rewarding days of hiking on the trail. <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#atsobo2021 #appalachaintrail #appalachaintrail2021 #atsobo #thruhike #thruhike2021 #hikemaine #hikenewhampshire #mainetogeorgia"

The entire mile up had waterfalls that were running quickly due to the rain before we got to the trail. A we were making our way up, it began to cloud up and rained hard on us for the remainder of the hike. At one point with some lightening and thunder. It was very windy and exposed on the backside of Old Speck and we slowly descended to the campsite for the night, which was our first AMC campsite so we had to pay to use it. Either way, after being drenched we were happy to be in the shelter early.

I am currently staying at the legendary Shaw's hiker hostel in Monson, Maine. I had planned for the 100 Mile Wilderness to take me 5-6 days, it took me 7. I was quite ambitious trying to crank out multiple 20+ mile days at the start and my body let me know that. My back broke out as if I was 14 again from the heat / moisture / and pack rubbing, my feet are sore. Aka I&nbsp;hurt.&nbsp;All of that to say, I took my foot off the gas pedal and am happy about it. Why rush ? My competitive spirit took hold of my mindset a couple of days, but for what purpose? Sure I set the goal of finishing by November 10th, but I have no real dead line. This has been a goal of mine for so long, I am going to ease my way into it a little nicer and truly appreciate the opportunity of being on this trail.&nbsp;<br><br>My favorite part of the 100 Mile Wilderness was White Cap mtn. I watched the sunset / sunrise on top of it with Katahdin in the background, and quite frankly, it was euphoric. I enjoy the physical challenge, I've found that my mind wanders all over the place throughout hiking all day. I think about people I love, places I've been, past experiences ( good and bad ). Something I try to do every morning is to practice positive self talk , and show myself self love. This makes the hard times hiking go a little easier. "" You've got this !"" Not "" Why are you out here, you can't do this "".

I can't imagine I smelled too great as I'm dripping with sweat and mud. Sat outside the store and stuffed my face with food. Found some trail magic walking out of town. Climbed a few mountains. Found a war statue. Climbed down another mountain. Got some insoles for my shoes at a gear shop. And a free beer. Really hoping these insoles solve my feet problems. I've gotten used to hiking with my feet hurting all day, but now they are keeping me up at night from the pain so that is just going to have to end. Looked down at my legs today and they were covered in bumps. Pretty sure it's a heat rash. I might be slightly dehydrated from this heat wave. Found a spot to camp in the cute town of Cheshire.

Now add in the mosquitoes - forgot about these buggers but they haven't forgotten us!<br><br>This week was made brilliant though by the lovely trail magic we had from Sue (who even drove Dolittle to the post office to get a resupply box) and her cold shandys and fruit, and by Sauerkraut and Mary Poppins, who gave us cold gatorade and crisps at a trailhead. These two finished section hiking the AT in 2013 - legends. And another shout out to the guy at the grocery store who gave us a couple cold waters and to a lovely woman called Amy who overheard our conversation at a restaurant in town last night and gave our table some money to help with our bill. The generosity of strangers has floored us. <br><br>We also got to meet back up with friends on the trail who are always a few days before or behind us üòäüçª<br><br>We're off trail for three days in Boston - Dolittle has to present her MSc thesis online and we have friends we cannot wait to see.

I always know when it is about to start pouring. It gets really dark, the wind picks up and then goes silent and all the birds stop singing. And then it goes from silent to the loudest downpour you have ever heard in seconds. You would think the forest canopy would shield some of the rain, but I was soaked and walking through a river of a trail instantly. Thunder cracked right overhead and it was so dark I could barely see the trail. Eventually it stopped, but there was no drying out of anything today. I found a shelter in the evening and a ton of other hikers. Everyone decided to camp so I have the shelter to myself, but now that the mosquitoes are back out in full force I might regret my decision. We swapped trail stories, discussed the worst dehydrated meals, and laughed as one hiker tried to stomach knock-off mac n cheese. I've never seen anything look so gross.

Then Walk and the guys picked me up from The Cabin. Walk and Amy rented an Airbnb in Bethel for a few days to visit so I have a couple days to make up my missed miles and relax before we head into the Mahoosucs and  New Hampshire.

I've decided that I'm not really hiking this trail. It's more of a stumble/falling/hopping kinda motion that I am slowly starting to grasp. Rolling my ankle, landing on my butt, catching myself from almost face planting, slamming my feet into roots and rocks is just a normal day on trail now. I came out here to challenge myself knowing this trail had all the things that I don't really like about hiking. Wet, buggy, muddy, very few views, walking in the forest all day, bad terrain, pointless ups and downs, climbs without rewards, no epic sunsets and sunrises, lots of people. But that is exactly why I'm here. How am I ever gonna get better if I don't push myself outside my comfort zone and do the hard things, the things I'm not good at? I've been out here almost a month and it's kicked my butt. There's good days and bad days. Today was a good day. I can't say I love this trail yet or that it feels like home, but it's starting to grow on me. It's already taught me a lot about myself and humbled me so hard. It's also shown me that I can push through some really hard shit and push past the pain and frustration. It's allowed me to meet so many more amazing people and given me one more reminder that people are awesome, we are all in this crazy world together, we are more alike than we are different, and all I need is a backpack and some food to live and be happy. Camping behind the local VFW hall in town tonight with a couple other hikers and stuffing my face off McDonald's dollar menu in true hiker trash fashion.<br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #backpackvermont #zebratales"

I took advantage of road and shuttle opportunities to slack-pack a 21 mile section over the Wildcat, Carter, and Moriah peaks...about 7 named peaks in all. I thought this would be an easy day given my UL pack but I was wrong once again. Climbs of 1000' in half a mile and 2000' in 1.5 miles were the order of the day. Up down up down. But the phenomenal views we had of Mt. Washington were worth it! I hiked with Toe Jam, a SOBO I met in Gorham. I'm going to blame this crazy hard and long day (hiking over 12 hrs from 0630 to 1900) on him but who are we kidding, you all know my track record for doing stupid long days. Still, he was the one who put the idea in my head. Was great to have a hiking companion for a change and the weather was good, if a bit hot...in the 90s the next few days and heat index of 99...more craziness. Finished the day eating heavy cals at the BBQ joint in town. Look at Toe Jam diving into ribs and pulled pork... he's a vegan but this is what this trail will do to you!

I pushed a 78 mile stretch in 3.5 days to get to Gorham NH and it about broke me. One day was 25 miles with over 10,300 feet of vertical gain... it's a long story you can read in the blog, culminating with heavy rain and a lightning strike on the ridge in front of me. The next day was even more life-threatening fun coming down vertical wet slab rock over and over and clambering across house-sized boulders for a mile in the Mahoosuc notch, also all very wet and slippery. I screamed with joy to pass into NH, where I was rewarded with another steep climb up a mountain and overgrown trail. I completed all of the AT in Maine (282 miles) in 14 days, so I can at least say I did my best and proved that I can survive a backpacking trip in Maine now that I'm older, wiser, and better prepared.

As is hot coffee. And a breakfast prepared for you. After coffee, yerba tea that the hostel makes and sells themselves, fruit, jam and toast, and bulgar (still no idea what it is) topped with tomatoes and feta cheese, I had all the energy in the word to run up Mt. Killington. It didn't kill me despite the name, but the clouds did kill the view. The rest of the day was spent cruising through the forest and up and down lots of little hills. A nice day to be in the forest with the high humidity. The trail joined up with the Long Trail yesterday so now I am seeing a lot more hikers who are doing that trail along with all the AT NOBOs. It's kinda comical to see the big difference between most AT NOBOs who are moving pretty quickly now that they are getting towards the end of their hike and the Long Trail NOBOs who are still just starting and some of them with insanely massive packs. I saw one guy who must have had 80 pounds of gear on his pack. I pushed 25 miles despite getting a late start coming from town and found a fellow hiker at the shelter who also hiked the PCT in 2017, the same year I did. It was so fun to laugh about that crazy year. I taped the arches of my feet this morning with the last of my leukotape and between that, some rest, and just telling myself to stop crying about my feet and just hike and forget about it, I had a pretty good day and think the feet might just be on the mend.

Bemis had a large rock top of the mountain that was neat to walk through and it rained hard for about 15 minutes prior to me getting into camp.

The views were crazy and hiking above treeline reminded us of hiking in the Whites last year (coming up in a few weeks, again).

Woke up around 10:45 hearing voices and seeing flashlights. Thought it was night hikers at first. But then more pass by and they're loud and sounding drunk. They obviously don't see my tent or don't care. I doze in and out of people going back and forth along the trail. I hear music and shouting start up in the distance. Just a backcountry Thursday night party. Eventually I tune out the noise and fall asleep. Wake up and get trucking up another mountain. All the sweat now that I'm out of the cold alpine mountains. I don't sense the humidity anymore now that I'm acclimated, but sweat pours from my forehead, nose, chin, and elbows every time I climb. I find a cool old fire lookout. I hitch a few miles into Lyme and pack out a beer and sandwich for dinner to celebrate finishing the Whites. Meet a NOBO and we get a ride back to trail with a guy who hiked the trail in '95 and wrote a dissertation on how the trail changes hikers with the main takeaway being that it restores their faith in humanity. I can't agree more. He also tells us the town of Lyme is the wealthiest town in New England. Pretty dang cute for a rich town. I climb some more and find an epic little stealth camping spot on an island between two arms of a brook. I camp with a couple NOBOs and their dog. We laugh and talk trail and life and life is good. I laugh about the fact I'm drinking a Sierra Nevada in New Hampshire, but my choices were either crap beer or California beer. Go figure. We attempt a fire which is pretty, but doesn't do much with the wet wood. Does New England ever dry out? Another night falling asleep to the wonderful sound of running water.

Ahhhhhh relief. A long downhill and then climbed Mt. Moosilauke, my last big mountain in the White Mountains. The trail slowly got less steep throughout the day as I left the Whites. Well at least I wasn't climbing straight up and down anymore. I was finally able to increase my hiking speed when I wasn't navigating the thick mud which apparently is just never ending with the crazy rains New England has had this summer. It was such a nice relief to not feel utter exhaustion all day. My feet are still absolutely destroyed from the Whites, but I am hoping that will get better as the terrain gets a little less rocky and maybe get a new pair of shoes soon. I'm hoping I just have tendonitis and not something more serious like stress fractures, but only time will tell. It was a quiet day as I get away from the touristy mountains that draw the mass of day hikers. Up until now the trail has been so technical that I have to pay attention to every step and the climbs have come nonstop so I've just been hiking and not listening to anything so that I can fully concentrate on the trail. Since I finally had a chance to breathe today and in an effort to take my mind off my feet I listened to a couple podcasts in the afternoon which was a nice change. The trees and landscape are changing along with the terrain. The mosquitos are back now that I'm out of the alpine mountains. Grrr. Found trail magic at the end of the day. Camping between a brook and a road, so hopefully the cars will stop as it gets dark and I can fall asleep to the sound of running water.<br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #girlswhohike #backpacknewhampshire&nbsp; #zebratales"

Couldn't even fall asleep until after 2 AM. What is wrong with me? Hobbled around like a drunk person every time I got up so I decided to give my feet as much rest as possible and get a late start to the trail. I even washed my clothes in the shower because I was too tired and lazy to walk across the street to the laundromat. I shoved all the calories I could into my mouth and got a ride back out. Climbed the Kinsman Moutains and slogged through mud. Soooooo much mud. Almost lost my poles about a million times when they sunk in. My legs and feet feel like they weigh a million pounds. Thankful for a sunny, dry, and warm day, such a nice change from the recent weather. Already was wishing I had eaten more food in town halfway through the day. I don't know how I can eat more food than I am, but I'm going to have to figure out a way to get more calories in. Literally felt like a zombie all day. All days on the trail are hard, but today was mentally, emotionally, and physically a tough one. You can only slip and fall and kick roots and land in mud puddles for so long before you just start to go crazy. <br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #girlswhohike #backpacknewhampshire&nbsp; #zebratales"

We had the biggest climb since Katahdin ahead of us up to North Crocker Mountain of about 3000 feet.  We didn‚Äôt climb it quickly but it seemed much more gradual than we expected. South Crocker Mountain was right after.  Both peaks were wooded and offered little for views. The descent down the Crockers was steep and took us a bit but we were in camp before 3 that afternoon.

Took a bit but we made the top, and took it easy. That climb was fueled by this ridiculously big peanut butter iced brownie from the Flagstaff general store. We didn‚Äôt go up to the peak of Sugarloaf as it was another .6 mile side trail to the top of the ski slopes on the other side. We hit the 200 mile mark right before we climbed up Spaulding Mountain. We‚Äôre making progress, but it can feel slow at times as Maine has been a tough state to put any sort of big mile days in. Spaulding Mountain also went up to just before the peak, and we passed on the side trail to the top as it was a wooded peak without views.  We descended a bit and had a nice few miles before our last climb of the day up Poplar Ridge. The day-ending climbs are becoming my least favorite, and this one was steep and slow.

We made our way down the mountains after hitting the peak of South Horn, and got picked up to go into @themaineroadhouse just outside of Stratton.

I picked up a couple of packages from the post office.  Mom killed it with the resupply and I got a new phone because my Samsung was having issues charging.

The views where clear from the top, which was wind swept and rocky. We crossed over and started going down the Arm. This is one of the steepest climbs on the AT. We descend down 1500 ft in a mile. The trail was covered with tangled roots and huge rock slabs that could be dangerous if it is wet. Luckily for us the weather held. We reached the bottom in a couple of hours. We stopped and took a rest before entering the hardest mile on the AT, the Mahoosuc Notch. <br><br>The Mahoosuc Notch is a .9 section of the AT that is known for its difficulty(some say high level of fun) due to the huge boulders and rocky terrain that you must navigate to get through the Notch.

I take off and climb up and down all the mountains. At some point I run into a guy as I'm heading up a windy climb. He tells me I should turn around and camp and wait out hiking the next section. He says it's too dangerous, the winds are too high, and it's all exposed. He tried to go and had to turn back. One thing I really hate is fear mongering. In real life, but especially on the trail. Everyone has different capabilities and experience and it's so frustrating to see hikers influence other hikers based off their experiences or comfort level. I literally have to walk away from him because he won't stop going off about the conditions. I get up above tree line and you can't see much. There's some crazy wind gusts, but it's totally doable.

My body feels like it has finally hit its max today. Energy is all gone. My feet hurt like no other. Pushing hard through the Whites has definitely put my body to the test. I make it down to the highway and try to hitch into town. No luck on a hitch. I call a shuttle and get a ride in. I find a cheap hotel since all the hostels are booked and lay out all my soaking wet gear hoping it will dry overnight. I sit in my hotel room and stuff my face with as much food as possible. I can't believe how much weight I've already lost. My feet hurt so bad. I don't know how I will ever walk again, let alone hike out tomorrow. Oh well, that's a problem for future Jenn.<br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #girlswhohike #backpacknewhampshire&nbsp; #zebratales"

Woke up to a gorgeous sky. The sun was out and I had a fun few miles trekking above tree line through the mountains. I made it to a hut sometime in the morning and stopped in to grab some water and was lucky enough to snag some leftover breakfast. The huts are all off the grid so whatever food doesn't get eaten has to get packed out so of you're lucky enough to time it right, they give the leftovers to thru-hiker. Cold eggs, sausage, and oatmeal never tasted so good. I could have stayed there all day in the cozy hut, but I kept on and made my way down a ridiculous climb down to Crawford Notch. And what do I find, not only one, but two different tents of trail magic. A grilled salmon burger, fruit and veggies, cookies, and hot coffee courtesy of the owner of @triplecrowncoffee. I stuck along way longer than I should of as we all exchanged trail stories and ate as much as I could. There's always a fine line between eating enough to fuel and going overboard and feeling horrible on a climb. I took off when one drunk NOBO who has been there all day started trying to challenge day hikers to pushup competitions. There's always that one guy! After a climb, I actually had some flat miles. I honestly didn't think I was even still on the AT, it was such a stark comparison to the trail up until now. I filled up on water and did one more big climb to end the day and found an epic cliff to camp on that has the most amazing view of all the mountains I just hiked through. It's supposed to rain tonight so I might be regretting my camping choice, but if not it will be an amazing sunrise!<br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #girlswhohike #backpacknewhampshire&nbsp; #zebratales"

Soooooo cold outside. Climbed up Wildcat Mountain and then had a crazy long descent down to Pinkham Notch. I hate steep downhills. Takes me forever. But I finally got to the bottom and grabbed hot coffee and a muffin at the visitor center while I quickly dried my gear out. Then it was all the climbing and rock hopping to make my way into The Presidentials. Climbing up Mt. Madison was insane. Every time I tried to stand up I just about got knocked off the mountain from the 70 mph winds. It took every ounce of energy to make it to the Madison Hut. My legs felt like they literally just didn't work anymore. But I went inside and chugged water, shoved all my snacks in my mouth and bought the only dessert they had left... vegan cake. It was gross, but hey it's cheap, had chocolate, and calories and really that's all that matters anymore. I contemplated stealth camping nearby since if I pushed on, I would have to go another eight miles and go up and over Mt. Washington which is one of the most dangerous mountains in the world on a windy day. But I couldn't justify stopping at only 3:30 especially on a rare non-rainy day, so I used my carb loading to my advantage and set off up another mountain. And another. And another. Finally made it to Mt. Washington which can be a ridiculously touristy place on a clear day, especially a Saturday. But with the high winds, the place was practically empty. I braced the wind and cold for a pic and a sweet view and then kept on going to find a place to camp. I made it to Lake of the Clouds hut which usually lets hikers sleep in their basement... except this year. Damn you covid. But I found a gorgeous place to stealth camp below the hut. It's going to be a cold and windy night, but the sunset made it all worth it. <br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #girlswhohike #backpacknewhampshire&nbsp; #zebratales"

My body just doesn't know what to do with beds and rest days now apparently. Wake up to the train and cars all night too. More foreign noises. But I wake feeling refreshed. All the breakfast food and waaaaay too much coffee while I wait for the weather to improve. Hit the trail around 9:30. A couple flat miles and then the climbing resumes. And the rain. I pop up on mountain after mountain. Crazy winds on top. No views today. The trail is a mud hole. I rock and root hop all day trying to avoid soaking my feet. No luck. The sun pops out for a sec to tease me. This section of trail is very touristy and has actual enclosed huts every 7 or 8 miles. They're crazy pricey so thru-hikers don't stay in them, but sometimes they'll give us leftover food if they have any after meals. I try my luck before finishing the day. No luck. Oh well. I find a place to stealth camp. The rain comes and goes all evening. Even though I'm relatively dry once I shed my hiking clothes, I can't warm up. The wind is chilling. Gonna be a cold one tonight. I already miss all my new trail friends from the hostel. Most of them stayed in town with the bad weather today. Guess I'll have to make new ones. Cold leftover pizza and knock-off oreos dipped in knock-off peanut butter for dinner.

We stopped at a shelter for lunch about a third of the way up. Once we made it to the ledges at the top we got a good look at the remaining peaks in the Bigelows, and we also had our next few mountains in front of us. We got views of the Crockers and Sugarloaf, which has a ski resort visible. We made our way down to a campsite before the climb up to Avery Peak the next morning (2000 ft up).

We have many words to describe our time in Maine (some choice swear words as well...) but the word that will be remembered is HUMBLING.<br><br>Maine has humbled us. We thought we were physically fit when we started this but the trail in Southern Maine has been unforgiving and incredibly tough. Watching your already slow mileage go down to 1 mile an hour at points has been so frustrating. This included going across the Mahoosuc range and the Mahoosuc notch, one of the most difficult miles of the entire trail (took us two hours for the 1 mile boulder scramble). <br><br>But, as the saying goes, 'the trail provides'. After a few rainy, painful days with low morale the skies cleared 15 miles into NH, our tent and gear dried out, we met a brit on the trail (trail name Rugby!) who gave us a taste of home and when we got up to a viewpoint, The Diplomat saw a fellow hiker in a Liverpool top (trail name Sauce) which lifted our spirits massively.<br><br>These pictures show our journey through our difficult week.

Late afternoon I arrive at Cooper Lodge, after really churning and burning with the expectation that I will be the first one there, however to no avail I am not the first one there and there are already people that have sought out the couple platforms in the building which the roof will not leak on, it is really a shame to see how bad the Cooper Lodge is in a state of disarray, So I find the best tent site for my non-freestanding tent. I return to the lodge and everyone is pretty much playing cards and or eating their evening dinner, I finish up and head back to my tent to turn in for the night, and once again mother nature unleashes a barrage of rain. The rain is so hard that it is actually bouncing up from the ground underneath my rain fly and into the ventilation of my tent and now I am basically on a waterbed as my inflatable mattress is keeping me from being in a total puddle of water. I make some adjustments, sop up the excess water with a small pack towel and hope that the rain will stop. Rain stops, temp drops, and it‚Äôs a brisk evening slumber. <br><br>Day 14 - this morning I wake up with the intention of getting to the top of Killington for my first Vermont 4k‚Äôer. Similar conditions to Katahdin, virtually no visibility and the wind is churning pretty good, I had two thoughts in mind, either continue down or take the gondola down and attempt to find a place to dry out all of my sopping wet gear. Within a few moments the sky unloads on us yet again, it‚Äôs actually kind of getting funny, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever been this wet ever for this long and with such daily consistency. We find a trail to the gondola and descend to it, The lift attendants must‚Äôve felt extremely bad for us because they let us get on the gondola without paying. Soaked once again, LOL. <br><br>Day 15 - I stay the day with a trail angel friend and in the actual sunshine of the day, I‚Äôm able to dry out all my gear. I return to the trail slackpack to White Rocks park.  IT ACTUALLY DOESN‚ÄôT RAIN TODAY.  And the journey continues‚Ä¶#thetrek #atsobo2021 #thruhike #trektheat"

Shortly there after I am the only one at the cabin and the skies look ominous, and before darkness falls there are now 14 people in the cabin, plenty of room and most of us are very happy we took shelter here, as Vermont shows us one hell of a thunderstorm and lightning display. <br><br>Day 11 - I meet a ton of great people here that are northbound and we all wake up relatively early and start our day. I‚Äôm heading in the opposite direction of them as I descend the mountain towards Killington. And yet again Vermont and the Appalachian Trail will take their pound of flesh each day and shortly after I crossed through Thundering Falls Boardwalk the sky prepares to unload on me. A very nice gentleman from the Green Mountain Trail crew offers me a ride on one of the dirt roads after the park and takes me to the Inn at Long Trail and I am extremely happy for his kindness as it is raining so hard you can barely see the road in front of us.

A storm is coming in. Have a pretty easy five miles down to Route 2 and go into a hostel in Gorham. My first real trail nero. The first shower in 10 days. Much needed. The smell of my socks and shoes... I can't even describe it. Resupply at Dollar General. Livin' that hikertrash life to the fullest. Trying to consume as many calories and let my feet rest as much as possible in my 24 hours off trail. Hikers trickle in throughout the day. Finally meet some more SOBOs. All the trail stories and laughs. Hostel life is the best. Hikers are the best. 30 hikers sharing one bathroom is fun. Find a Canadian beer at the gas station which pairs perfectly with a Trailer Park Boys binge. It rains off and on all day. A good day to be in town. Heading into the White Mountains tomorrow. Weather forecast shows thunderstorms. Such is the AT.<br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #girlswhohike #backpacknewhampshire&nbsp; #zebratales

Got back onto trail around 9. Easy, Walk, and I walked our longest day to date on trail. It was relatively flat and we just bounced around the rivers all day. We made it to camp to an open shelter and settled in for the night. As I was filtering water and watching the frogs in the pond battle for territory, I heard some large animals moving next to me. About 100 yards away, a moose and two calves stood eating vegetation. It was a cool experience to sit and watch them eat. ‚úÖ one goal for this trip.<br><br>Day 14 - ""Aching Ankles""<br>Miles - 13.1<br>MM - 132.4 to 145.5 <br><br>Started out with a climb up to the top of Moxie Bald Mountain and dropped right back down the other side. Both Walk and I had ankles that were bothering us today, I'm thinking from twisting them a few times in the past couple of hiking days as well as a little fatigue from nearly 18 miles the day before. We had a couple of flat miles then started the 4 mile ascent up Pleasant Pond mountain. After reaching the top, we hung out a little and then walked down to the shelter at the bottom. Another night in the shelter. Full with us and 2 NOBOs. We met another SOBO, Mike, tonight and about 10 NOBOs ready to finish.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachaintrail #appalachaintrail2021 #thruhike2021 #thruhike #at2021 #atsobo #atsobo2021 #mainetogeorgia #hikemaine #moose"

So happy the rain stopped. Although all of my stuff is still pretty wet. Putting on wet shorts, socks, and shoes is super fun üôÑ Climbed up and down all day per usual. Got to pass lots of NOBOs early on and answer all their anxious questions about ""The Notch"". Found a mountain peak this wasn't whipping with the wind and laid all my stuff out to dry. The good thing about good backpacking gear is it can usually dry out in about 5-10 minutes in direct sunlight. I was starving all day with all the climbing. I think the real hiker hunger is starting to set in where the hunger just never really goes away. Walked through so many muddy bogs today. Luckily there are wooden planks through most of them, but one misstep and you're waist deep in some of the bogs. Almost lost my trekking pole a few times. It was a muddy mess and my shoes and socks were still soaked when I finally ended the day. My feet looked like a dead man's feet. And smelled like one. It's been nine days without a shower or washing my clothes now. I'm sure I smell great. I passed from Maine into New Hampshire today. One state down! And arguably the hardest. New Hampshire is also a contender for the hardest state, specifically because of the White Mountains.

No surprise there. The sky's been hazy for awhile now. Apparently it's the smoke from some fires in Canada. Pass a sign for ""An Exceptional View"". There is no view. I sweat my butt off climbing a mountain and am greeted with an insane wind on the top. Stop for a snack and am freezing in minutes. Make it down to a trailhead around noon with trail magic. Roast beef sandwich, watermelon, homemade cookies, powerade, and good company. People are awesome. Meet a NOBO who is trying to get a ride to the hospital. He thinks he might have bruised or broke some ribs on a bad fall in the Mahoosuc Notch. It's not the first horror story I've heard about this notch. I pull myself away from the trail magic and climb another mountain. It starts raining in the afternoon. I hit the Mahoosuc Notch around 4:30, rumored as the most technical mile on trail. I've been warned not to attempt it in the rain. It's raining, but hasn't started pouring yet so I go anyways. It's scrambling, crawling, leaping, shimmying up a rocky canyon. It's kinda fun trying to guess where to go. It's a bit slippery in the rain, but I'm fairly careful. There's still ice in some of the crevasses and it's freezing when you get down low. I pass one guy in it. He doesn't seem to be enjoying himself as much. I make it out right as the rain really starts coming down. The mile took me about 45 minutes. I've heard people say it can take up to&nbsp;4 hours in horrible conditions. Ugh. I go off trail to find water and come back to hurry up and set my tent up. I can't find my trekking poles and realize I left them at the creek and run back to find them. On the way back I pass the guy and he's heading out on a side trail. I ask if he's ok. He said he's taking this side trail back to town. He says he needs a cigarette. He shuffles past. His shorts are torn down the back. Life's rough out here sometimes, man. I get my tent set up and crawl in trying not to soak everything. No luck. Oh well. I'm beat. Gonna be a chilly night up here in these rainy mountains. <br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #girlswhohike #backpackmaine&nbsp; #zebratales"

Had a quiet morning climbing up and down through the fog and the mud. It's like the hot lava game we played as kids except the lava is mud and you might loose a shoe if you step in the wrong spot. Miles are hard to come by today. Reach a road crossing in the middle of nowhere and stick my thumb out and get picked up a second later. It's always in the most unlikely places that you get a fast hitch. A guy and his son are heading to town for a few camping snacks so they drive me to the store and bring me back to the trail. Fastest resupply of my hiking career I do believe. It's hot and I'm sweaty, but I can't turn down a cup of hot coffee from town. Nothing like some caffeine and carbs to give one an instant hiking boost. The rest of the day is straight up and down every mountain. I'm exhausted as I near the end of the day. I pop out on a road and find a fellow hiker doing trail magic as he is taking some time off trail to rest his knees. A Pepsi, the most delicious apple, and a mini pie are quite a treat. I camp with some NOBOs. Turns out one of them hiked the PCT the same year I did. Probably the 6th person I have met out here with the same story. It's always fun trying to guess where we might have passed each other along the way. We spend the evening eating and talking trail woes and funny stories and they give me the lowdown on all the best (and worst) hostels and restaurants in the south. My mouth is already watering. We're camping by a running brook. Such a soothing sound to fall asleep beside. <br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #girlswhohike #backpackmaine&nbsp; #zebratales"

Lots of tossing and turning and snoring and sleeping pad noises. Woke up at 5:30 and couldn't fall back asleep despite waking up all night. No luck hitching this drizzly morning so I walk the couple miles from the shelter back to town. Spent all morning getting the new phone situated with everything I need, downloading apps, checking in with the world, trying to remember all my passwords, scout out the miles ahead. Trying to find breakfast in a ritzy lake town on a Sunday morning... no luck, grocery store breakfast it is. It pours for a few hours so I find a tiny covered spot outside the store to chill, eat, and try and chug coffee to stay warm and let the rain pass. The cashier and I are now on a first name basis after my third trip inside to caffeinate. The rain finally lets up late morning and I get a quick hitch back to trail. The trail is a mudfest and it is beyond foggy. I pass a lake and I can't see 20 feet out into the water. I meet Lorax, a NOBO who is slack-packing this section going south and we hike together most of the day. This is literally the first time I've hiked with anyone on this trail. We talk for hours and the day flies by. A friend of his wife is following them along the trail in their van so when we reach the highway they treat me to drinks and snacks and offer me a place to stay at their house in Montana when I hike the CDT. I mean if I hike the CDT üòâ After all the surplus calories I cruise through the rest of the day and find a shelter to stay at... me and every other NOBO around. The shelter is already packed and I find one of the last halfway decent tent spots. I chat up Gramps who is from Tehachapi and has section hiked the PCT. Hikers mingle, make fires, and mostly eat. All is quiet by 9 PM - hiker midnight. This is the life.<br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #girlswhohike #backpackmaine&nbsp; #zebratales"

I had too many nights putting wet shoes back on in camp, so that justifies the weight for now.

The climb up started steep and slow and leveled out before getting up top to get some views of the white cap range. Then the real climbing started. The next half mile felt like it went straight up and finished with a short rock scramble to the top. Difficult but rewarding.&nbsp; My feet were beat so we rolled into Chairback Gap Lean to and set up around 4. Hung out, ate, and Easy got a nice fire going.&nbsp;The nights are getting chillier and have been awesome sleeping.

Saw Pizza and Beer (Jeff) for likely the last time - he was a great resource and hiking buddy for the past few days.&nbsp;The afternoon was spent talking to NOBOs as they came through and picking their brains. Spent the night with Spring Break, Stoney, Snickers, and Mullet. Rained hard all night so the shelter was a great call.

We knew since we were starting on an easy pace we didn't have to rush out of camp, so we laid back down. We got up and got out of camp around 8. It was dry for a short time but the remainder of the day was rainy and colder. We had no views on White Cap Mountain. It continued to rain on us the rest of the day, we had a bunch of up and down and a long decent into the shelter. We had some good company in the shelter with some NOBOs dropping knowledge and telling stories. Easy decided he was going to yo-yo the 100 MW 11 times instead of completing the trail, lol.&nbsp; For the second night in a row we fell asleep with rain hitting the shelter roof.

Neither of us slept very sound last night. We both decide it was because we were both pretty sore from the last few days.<br><br>We break camp from Sabbath headed to Bemis Mountain Lean-to. We start out with a small climb that warms us up. The weather seems nice today. The sky is slightly overcast and the wind  is blowing a slight breeze. We find a small logging road and enjoy our first break of the day.<br><br>After a short break and short conversations with some other hikers going north, we head out. There have not been many views today. Mostly ponds and still waters. I am also always surprised at the number of bogs we pass through. The small bog bridges definitely make a difference, if not for them we would more than likely lose a shoe in the black muck.<br><br>We continued on until reaching Bemis Stream. The water is low so there is no need to take off our shoes. We glide over the rocks and find a small, shaded area to have lunch. <br><br>After lunch we start our climb up Bemis Mountain. The climb is long, steep and rocky. Once we got through the biggest part of the climb we came to a section the had many granite outcrops with little vegetation. We got some great views before arriving at the summit of Bemis Mountain Second, which is a smaller brother to Bemis Mountain.<br><br>We stopped at the Bemis Mountain Lean-to for the evening. We eat and get ready for bed. Tomorrow will be an early day. We will summit Bemis then Old Blue tomorrow and after we will go into Andover to resupply. Only 43.7 miles left in n Maine. <br><br>#appalachiantrail #appalachiantrail2021 #atclassof2021 #atflipflop2021 #almostsobo #outdoors #outside #trails #hike #backpacking #couplesthatbackpack #withguthook #hailstate #hikertrash #atsobo2021 #mainetogeorgia #nature #manofthewoods #travelbyfoot #vlog #blog #hikerofinstagram #couplesthathike #walkthisway #mountains #choosemountains #themountainsarecalling #mcdillsonthemove #maine #mountainview"

Yesterday we hiked in the rain and it sucked. Today I am thankful for sunlight. We strike out headed up Saddleback Junior. Despite its name it was not a junior climb. <br><br>We head up and over until we reach the first summit. Saddleback Junior, just like most of the summits here in Maine, is very steep when getting close to the top. Most times when summiting it is so steep it ends up with a short rock scramble. <br><br>The view from the top is great. The sky is a clear with a light blue color. The suns shines across the rest of the valley and we can see the other mountains that we will be crossing today. The Horn and Saddleback are what‚Äôs left.<br><br>We head down from Junior. We maneuver down the many rocks and roots until it flattens out for a short reprieve. We then head back up to the Horn. The Horn is around 3600 feet. What is so cool here is that when you get near the top you break tree line. This is where there is little vegetation and trees. It is mainly a path on rocks for 2.5 miles. In bad weather it could be dangerous but we were blessed with good weather. <br><br>The few miles above tree-line today was some of the most beautiful hiking I have ever. The 360¬∞ views were break-taking. We may our clothes out on the Horn and let everything dry while we have lunch. After that we gather our things and press forward down the ridge and and back up to Saddleback Mountain.<br><br>Saddleback is a 4000 ft mountain and you can definitely feel it on the climb. The climb consist of steep granite slabs m, followed by a rock scramble then a semi flat walk to the summit. The summit is phenomenal. We sit and take in the views then head down to the shelter. <br><br>#appalachiantrail #appalachiantrail2021 #atclassof2021 #atflipflop2021 #almostsobo #outdoors #outside #trails #hike #backpacking #couplesthatbackpack #withguthook #hailstate #hikertrash #atsobo2021 #mainetogeorgia #nature #manofthewoods #travelbyfoot #vlog #blog #hikerofinstagram #couplesthathike #choosemountains #thisistheway #mando #wildflower #mcdillsonthemove #maine #takelessdomore"

The next time I wake up it had been raining for an hour and showed no signs of stopping. The rain wasn‚Äôt heavy but it was steady. <br><br>After packing up camp, we sat around and talked about the immense amount of elevation gain and loss we did the day before, almost 10,000 ft combined. We enjoy each other‚Äôs company before the first of us head out. Kaci and I were last to leave. We hiked with ‚ÄúOdd Pole‚Äù most of the day. He is a SOBO we have been hiking around for a few days. At least we got to enjoy the rain with someone else.<br><br>The rain made us slow. We trudged up and down, going over roots and climbing up slabs of granite. The rocks and roots become especially slick after and during rain. It is easy to lose your footing and fall over. Falling over is a lot easier to do since we have packs on. When you get off balance you can‚Äôt stop yourself and you topple over. I fell once yesterday. Kaci fell once today. She jumped back up and was fine  but it makes us a lot more cautious. We eventually get to the shelter and we get spot inside. There are 6 people in the shelter so it should be a fun night. Our clothes and things are hung all around the front opening of the shelter. They probably won‚Äôt dry out all the way but at least they can dry out a little. <br><br>Tomorrow we go over Saddleback. We will have 2.5 miles of exposed trail above tree line. Hopefully we should have a beautiful day.

We were expecting it to rain on us pretty much all day but the weather was moving in slower than forecast. We hit the trail stepping to make our 8 miles to the shelter.<br><br>The first climbs were not too bad even though each of the Crocketts were over 4000 foot in height. After going over 2 more peaks we felt like we were doing very well with our time so when we got to our 8 mile mark we decided that we would push further in order to get ahead of the late rain, it made the day a lot bigger and more difficult. <br><br>Up and over 2 more peaks close to 4000 ft make our elevation gain and loss add up to near 9000 feet in change throughout the day. By the time we roll into camp we are tired. I didn‚Äôt film much because of the long mileage today. We eventually get to the campsite in time to beat the weather.

We are greeted at the trailhead by our first big trail magic headed south, Stratton‚Äôs Chief of Police a.k.a ‚ÄúBourbon Batman.‚Äù He grills us hotdogs and sausages, tells us hilarious stories, and gives us cold drinks. Us, along with some other hikers enjoy his company until our shuttle arrives to pick us up. Tonight and tomorrow we are staying at the Maine Roadhouse. <br><br>The Main Roadhouse is a recently remodeled, reopened hostile in Stratton, ME. The new owners Jen and Jen were the most accommodating hostel hosts could be. This hostel will, in my opinion, become a place of legend. <br><br>Jen and Jen acquired it from a friend of theirs, Sue. Sue was actually here with us and she was so interesting. She has done a lot of different things from hiking the trail to many business ventures. We had breakfast with Sue and enjoyed her many colorful stories and lively attitude. <br><br>We resupply, relax, and recover to get ready for the next part of the trail. The next section will be as difficult as anything we have done. There is also rain coming in today and tomorrow so it is gonna be a long 2 days going over the mountains soaked in cold rain.

Every town we go into I find myself tearing up and smiling my head off from how kind these folx are.<br><br>Hiking has been fun, the terrain here in New Hampshire is a little kinder than in Maine. Summiting Mt Madison in 60mph wind gusts and bullet-like wind was probably my favorite hiking I've ever done. I'll do my best to check in again soon, batteries only last so long, and service is always few and far between.

But that meant lots of time lying in my tent and my feet finally got plenty of rest and I hit the trail feeling much better today. The taping technique I used seems to be helping my inflamed Achilles and it's the first day I can walk without thinking about the pain I'm in every second. I have to slow down a lot and walk kinda funny since my ankle is pretty immobilized, but eventually I get the hang of my new stride and make it work. So thankful. The trail always provides. I just had to get knocked down and humbled a bit first. I finally finish the Hundred Mile Wilderness and make it to my first town stop in Monson around 2 PM. The cutest and tiniest town ever. A hostel full of hikers. Real food. A free beer. A much needed shower. So much laughter and trail talk. It's the best. Town days always fly by with all the chores and checking in with people back home to let them know you haven't been eatin by a bear and trying to figure out how to consume as much food as possible in the few hours you have. Smelly gear hanging around everywhere to dry, lines of shoes and backpacks. Everyone munching on their own large pizza and sorting through resupply boxes wearing loaner clothes that are mismatched and two sizes too big. It probably looks like a circus to anyone on the outside, but for hikers this is heaven. <br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #100milewilderness #girlswhohike #backpackmaine&nbsp; #zebratales"

Climbing all day. Beyond exhausted. Every time I stopped to catch my breath, my eyes would start to close... wake up I would yell to myself. A guy told me he burned 7000 calories the other day in 15 miles. And that was a day with only one mountain. I don't know how many mountains I did today... 7, 8? I doubt I'm eating more than 3000 calories a day right now, if that. No wonder by body is shutting down. To top it off my left Achilles tendon started bugging me yesterday and today it was on fire. Literally felt like my entire back of my ankle is covered in blisters, except it's not. I spent the whole day trying to figure out how to walk without aggravating it more and also not compensating with my other leg because I know that will only lead to another injury. I have to remind myself that this will pass. The beginning is always the hardest. I'm hiking in new terrain. And putting in big miles with these kind of climbs is not gonna be doable until my body gets used to it. It's so hard for me to slow down, but I'm going to have to force myself to. It's a marathon, not a sprint. Luckily it rained all day to keep it cool and keep the mosquitoes mostly away. Unfortunately it also made the rocks incredibly slippery. So many times I landed on my butt and really did not want to get back up. Tears welled in my eyes a couple times, I can't even remember the last time I cried. Just wondering why it has to be so hard. But it does have to be. Because it wouldn't be worth it if wasn't. Because I came out here knowing this would challenge me in new ways and wanting that. And it is. Took all my energy to make it 17 miles. Laying in my tent, stretching, pretending I'm a physical therapist, experimenting with taping my Achilles, the rain coming down, finally a chance to breathe and relax. Trying not to fall asleep because it's only 6 PM. Cutting out coffee at the beginning of a thru hike might not have been the best idea üòÇ<br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #100milewilderness #girlswhohike #backpackmaine  #zebratales"

Who cares. Pack up. Breakfast on the beach. Another peanut butter and whatever crumbly stuff I have tortilla wrap. Second day without coffee. Besides being sick, that's probably my longest streak in years. I miss the jolt, but I'll survive. I don't have a choice. Today I climb. All day. There are no switchbacks here. Straight up and down every mountain. I can't count how many there were today. Sometimes it's actually climbing, pulling yourself up roots and boulders. The sweat is insane. I can't imagine how bad I must smell. Good thing everyone else does too. Finally get a couple views. And can almost see the sun through the haze. It's awesome, but I sure hope every East-coaster gets a chance to see some real west coast mountains someday üòâ Normally I can bust out 10-15 miles before stopping or needing water. Not out here. Every few miles I need water and rest and food. Maybe I'm out of shape. Maybe this just really is the hardest part of the entire Appalachian Trail like everyone says. By the end of the day my feet hurt soooooooo bad. I am so excited to make it to our stealth camping spot beside the river. There are eight others camping here.&nbsp; <br>Some dude makes a fire right behind a no fires sign. He says he didn't see it. You couldn't light this place on fire if you tried. The most time I've spent with others so far on trail. We eat dinner together and talk about our lives and aches and food. Life is good. I make it to 9:30 tonight.

Please go by, please go by... no luck. Ranger pops out and I try and open my sleepy eyes. Sleepy from only 11 hours of sleep. I needed that. Threatens me with a $250 fine. He's a Baxter State Park Ranger. I'm outside his jurisdiction. Camping where I was told I could. I play it nice and innocent 'cause ain't no cop wants to be proven wrong. He ""let's me go"". Asks me if I have any experience backpacking... üòâ I pack up fast and walk a half a mile down the road where he tells me there is a breakfast joint that opens at 7. Get there at 7:03. Not open til 8 today. Eat my peanut butter, trail mix, pop tart, granola tortilla wrap. Stick around to buy some coffee when the store opens and chat up some NOBOs. Hit the trail on a caffeine high. 8 AM and it's already humid AF. The sweating basically never stops all day. Plank walks over bogs. Freaking roots and rocks everywhere. You don't hike here, you boulder/root hop throughout the trail, staring at the ground nonstop so you don't roll an ankle. Miles don't come easy. Nothing does. Mosquitos are relentless. Flies in my eyes. Go off trail for lunch just so I can jump in a cold lake. So worth it. Saw a moose. Tripped trying to get a picture and scared him. Didn't stick around for the pic. 23 miles into the day I find a sandy beach to stealth camp on. Feels like the hardest 23 miles of my life. How can my feet hurt so bad? How can I already be this hungry? How am I so tired? I feel like I've never hiked before. But the beach is pretty.

But I guess I was too excited for that. Finally crawled out of my hostel bed at 5 AM, whispered with the other hikers who were up and ready, ate a frozen breakfast sandwich, shuttle to Baxter State Park, Ranger briefed us on climbing Katadhin. In other words he told us it was supposed to thunderstorm and noone was coming up for us if we called. Sweet. Practically ran up the mountain I was so excited. So much fun scrambling up the rock faces, like a giant scavenger hunt trying to find the white blazes on the rocks. Rebar in some of the rocks to pull yourself up. Wind blowing like crazy. Almost blew me off a cliff or two. Pure adrenaline. Trail flattens out and I am finally not huffing and puffing and am instantly freezing from being covered in sweat and oh yea, rain. Left Cali at 115¬∞and fires everywhere. And it's raining here. Make it to the top. Couple pics, protein bar shoved in the mouth. Can't see a thing as I gaze out from the northern&nbsp; terminus, what should be an epic view. Five minutes later heading back down. Soaked. Ecstatic. Pass tons of hikers who turned back. This climb is no joke. Especially in a storm. Make it back to the ranger station, where I have a reservation to camp because you have to. But I feel good so I push on. 10 miles later my feet hurt like a mother and I collapse when I finally get out of the state park boundaries, where camping is allowed. I lie on the wet ground, I'm soaked in sweat and rain anyways. Set up my tent, try to stretch, eat, sip the mini whiskey bottle I forgot I had brought to drink on top of Katahdin. When you're exhausted and dehydrated whiskey is anything but refreshing. But it does help to fall asleep by 8:30 and sleep soundly for most of the night.<br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #100milewilderness #girlswhohike #backpackmaine  #zebratales"

Everyone at camp was moving about the same pace too. We all know we have a hard day in front of us. Today we are going into the Bigelow Range and that means summiting 4 peaks: Little Bigelow, Avery Peak, West Bigelow, and South Horn. <br><br>Little Bigelow was relatively easy. We stayed half way up the climb last night at the lean-to so it eased a little of the burden. Upon Little Bigelow we see the two 4000 ft mountains that we will have to cross, Avery Peak and West Bigelow. <br> <br>The climb up Avery is strenuous and slow. The trail seems to go straight up at times and we have to maneuver around huge boulders and roots. The climb is worth the energy because at the top we get a 360¬∞ view of the surrounding landscape. It is absolutely beautiful and mesmerizing. We eat lunch at the top and continue on.<br><br>West Bigelow was not as much of a climb but it still had a beautiful summit with breathtaking views. We crossed over West Bigelow then headed down the ridge. The wind was blowing us back and forth on the open summit. We eventually made it down and started our ascent up South Horn. <br><br>South Horn was kind of gentle until about .3 from the summit, then it got steep. We crested the Horn and were able to see the shelter .5 miles down. We headed down to the shelter as fast as our sore feet could carry us. <br><br>We made it to the shelter and got a really nice camp spot. We even have service tonight so we plan to try and post a little I think.<br><br>#appalachiantrail #appalachiantrail2021 #atclassof2021 #atflipflop2021 #almostsobo #outdooors #outside #trails #hike #backpacking #couplesthatbackpack #withguthook #hailstate #hikertrash #atsobo2021 #mainetogeorgia #nature #manofthewoods #travelbyfoot #vlog #blog #hikerofinstagram #couplesthathike #walkthisway #thisistheway #mando #wildflower #mcdillsonthemove #maine"

Most of the time 4th of July is spent with family and friends eating grilled food and splashing in a pool. We could swim though, it would just be it colder.<br><br>The morning hike has been good. A few ascents and descents followed by flat terrain. We stopped for lunch at Flagstaff Campsite. There is a beach here but it is a little chilly to swim. We are only going a few miles further and then chill for the day. We are resting up for our new few days, which will be pretty tough.<br><br>We got to camp early today because of the low mileage day. We built a fire and stayed warm. There are a number of other SOBO hikers at the lean-to so we decided to tent camp. I cooked early and we are in bed early because we want to get up really early to start hiking.<br><br>Last night we heard fireworks and I am hoping to hear them again. It hasn‚Äôt seemed like it was a holiday today, it just felt like another day of hiking. We head to Stratton in the few days and we have to find somewhere to stay. We don‚Äôt want to spend a huge amount of money at a hostel so we are weighing our options. We will have to decide by tomorrow.

I‚Äôm all registered online üôèüòä I‚Äôve researched for countless hours on the best gear for my preferences. <br><br>I grew up near the AT (Grottoes, VA) and spent a lot of time in the outdoors hiking & camping with my family.

I picked up a travel nursing assignment in Roanoke, VA because I felt overwhelming stress and like I did not belong in that city. I felt like a sore thumb.<br><br>For some reason, I feel a hole in the soul. I‚Äôve tried everything under the sun to fill this ‚Äòhole in the soul‚Äô and I‚Äôm finally in a spot to do some serious soul searching. I want to go off the grid and feel more connected with nature. I want to find a deeper meaning and fulfillment within myself. For some reason, I feel this is perfect. I have a spot of financial stability to take time off & travel alone. <br><br>When I think of the times I felt the most free, I think of running in the fields in my hometown. And being in the woods. Nothing but a fire, a sleeping bag, and the river. Camping. These are the memories I love the most and long to create more of. When I was stressed as a child, I ran off and put up a hammock in the woods and spent the night there. <br><br> I hope this journey can help me find my peace, and bring me back to a place where I feel belonging and understanding of who I am supposed to be. <br><br> #AT2021 #atsobo2021 #appalachiantrailsouthbound #appalachiantrail #athiker #atsouthbound #mainetogeorgia #walkaboutoutfitter #appalachiantrail2021 #southboundat #soboappalachianhiker #athiker2021 #2021at #hiker #appalachianmountains"
