It was socked in up at 5,000 feet and cleared as we made our way down. Amy was coming down to visit Walk and slack us for a couple days so we made it down the mountain and walked by the VA Creeper Trail for a while before Amy picked us up and we went back to the house for the night. The AirBnB was a cool little cabin in Damascus. We relaxed and got ready for a big day coming. <br><br>Day 140 ‚ÄúTennessee‚Äù<br>Miles - 27.2<br>MM - 1716.8 to 1744.0<br><br>First thing in the morning, we set out to get some slackpacking miles in.  We had a hill to get up and over before we walked through Damascus. On the way out of Damascus, we had a decent climb back to elevation. We crossed into TN about 2/3 of the way through the climb, which ended the longest state on the trail. VA was beautiful and a grind to get through. The rest of the day we cruised to an open field that we ended on the south side of. This was my longest hiking day on trail to this point in time. On our way down, we had a beautiful sunset and once we got to the van, I drove back to the house and we resupplied for the coming days. <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>#appalachaintrail #atsobo #thruhike #appalachaintrail2021 #atsobo2021 #thruhike2021 #mainetogeorgia #atclassof2021

Never have I been so stripped down to the barest of human conditions, nor felt my raw emotions in a more unalloyed, visceral fashion. You brought me through the highest joys, and the lowest lows ‚Ä¶ now I‚Äôm faced with the after. <br><br>This insane but beautiful jolt back into what I thought was ‚Äúnormal,‚Äù the after of a thru hike can be as tumultuous as the journey itself. A lot of people talk about "post-trail depression" in the context of thru hiking, and in the aftermath of the physiological and psychological changes that occur on trail ‚Ä¶ it makes sense. Trekking sun up to sun down for 8.5 months, your mind becomes accustomed to the constant surge of endorphins, and this unique ‚Äúhigh‚Äù becomes your norm. Suddenly stripped of the opportunity to reach that daily high, thru hikers are often thrown back into a world of walls, timelines, couches and computers at the end. Sitting down to lunch with a friend fresh after my AT finish, he asked me ‚Äúhow can you top that? I mean, how do you stimulate yourself more?‚Äù And I guess if stimulation is the goal ‚Ä¶ depression in the aftermath of a thru is a logical spiral. <br><br>But if the pursuit of greater stimulation is the goal, not only will most of your life be a battle with the law of diminishing returns, but even the greatest trail will fail to quench your needs. Something @wowiwalk and I endlessly talked about on the AT is the importance, and necessity, of being able to find joy, satisfaction and beauty no matter the circumstances or setting on trail ‚Ä¶ and in life. If euphoric mountain-top moments are the goal of a thru hike, most of your trip will be miserable, and if life-changing journeys or experiences are the only time you find beauty and joy on this earth, you‚Äôll live with constant disquiet.<br><br>This is not to say that post-trail depression is a myth. But I‚Äôm striving not to let the lasting impact of this experience be diminished by the constant dissatisfaction of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs next.‚Äù Sit in your accomplishments. Relish in the wild beauty you just witnessed, and learn where to find it after the fact. Seek peace, and you will enter your next journey, whatever it may be, with unbridled anticipation.

We walked by a closed visitors center, and ate lunch at a really nice shelter in the sun.  It was a bit warmer during the day.  We hiked the last 3 or 4 miles in the dark, and the last hill was a bit of a butt kicker, but we made camp around 7. <br><br>Day 138 ‚ÄúGrayson Highlands‚Äù<br>Miles - 20.2<br>MM - 1678.0 to 1698.2<br><br>First thing in the morning, we started up the remainder of Hurricane Mountain. After that climb and descent, we walked gradually uphill to an open field above 5,000 feet.  This was the first time we‚Äôve been above 5k since Mt. Lafayette in NH. We cruised in some open fields and finally into Grayson Highlands.  We stayed above 5k for the majority of the day and enjoyed some of the best views in Virginia. The other highlight of the Grayson Highlands are the wild ponies, which we saw all day as well. We came down past Mt. Rogers, the highest peak in VA, at about dark and set up camp on the South side of a parking lot. We had a lot of activity in the area overnight.  Starting around 10ish the coyotes were howling and it was extremely loud. We also had a lot of people stopping in the parking lot by us. I had a horrible night of sleep, but enjoyed the sounds of the night. <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>#appalachaintrail #atsobo #thruhike #appalachaintrail2021 #atsobo2021 #thruhike2021 #mainetogeorgia #atclassof2021

There was really nothing of note during our hiking day aside from the final climb that got rocky towards the top. We had a long ride back to the hostel and had a great conversation with Julie, the owner.  We had spaghetti for dinner and after dinner talked with two other SOBOs who were in a tough spot in their hike.  Dave broke his shoulder in a fall and they were trying to figure out how to potentially slackpack to the end.  In the middle of talking after dinner, we heard an old voice come in the front door. Our buddy, Too Late, showed up.  We haven‚Äôt seen him since Bennington, VT. We talked and caught up and went to bed. <br><br>Day 135 ‚ÄúBear Garden Night‚Äù<br>Miles - 17.8<br>MM - 1617.1 to 1634.9<br><br>We had a long ride to the trailhead from Weary Feet and we had some great conversation with Robert about hunting in VA basically the whole way.  During the hiking day, we had three climbs. The first of which was up to Chestnut Knob Shelter which was a cool, fully enclosed stone shelter.  After this we walked in some open balds for a while and had great views.  The next few climbs were steeper and we moved through them and headed into Bear Garden Hostel for the night. Dave and Melissa were there continuing their slackpack adventure, and Too Late showed up later in the evening.  We ate a bunch of food from the freezer and had a very comfortable night inside. <br><br>Day 136 ‚ÄúResupply at a Sunoco‚Äù<br>Miles - 17.1<br>MM - 1634.9 to 1652.0<br><br>We headed out of bear garden with Too Late back in the crew.  We planned a shorter and easier day to resupply for our push to Damascus. The hiking was pretty easy and we made it to a Sunoco station that had the snacks we needed to resupply and a bunch of food to eat while we were there. We headed up the mountain to the shelter for the night with full packs ready to finish off the highlands in VA in the coming days. <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>#appalachaintrail #atsobo #thruhike #appalachaintrail2021 #atsobo2021 #thruhike2021 #mainetogeorgia #atclassof2021

Over the years, particularly in the last three, in my continuing trend of uprooting my life every three to six months for a thru-hike or a new job or an escape framed as a mental reset, I‚Äôve gotten pretty used to drastic lifestyle changes. Burlington has been a big transition. I‚Äôm missing smaller places. Big sunrises <br>‚Ä¢<br>Cities with lots of stoplights and corporate corner stores and more than one main road have always left me homesick for little towns with dirt roads running through them and just a few stop signs, but not too many. You‚Äôve only got to drive nine minutes to a trailhead that‚Äôs a gateway to a type of desert backcountry you can‚Äôt find most other places.<br>‚Ä¢<br>The kind of place you‚Äôre always excited to see a sunrise peeking over the horizon and illuminating your favorite hill or lake or juniper tree just outside your front door or from the trunk of your car where the pink sand drifts with timelessness and it find its way into every possible pore on your body. It won‚Äôt leave like it‚Äôs trying to keep you remembering that one time you watched a rainbow laughing, and there were fireworks inside your fingertips and you were so in love for three months.

Us hiker trash usually end up nodding, not needing words, knowing together this secret world.<br>‚Ä¢<br>Rad and I pushed a single-day Presidential traverse. It was miserably wet, cold, and quiet. Besides the roar of raindrops and swirling wind, it was silent on the mountain.<br>‚Ä¢<br>I had become accustomed to clouds consuming the White Mountain vistas after that week. We imagined their glory but witnessed only clouds and trees. We had no energy to talk above the wind and we dragged our pruned feet over the wet rocks. <br>‚Ä¢<br>Later, while hiking up Mt. Lafayette, we realized we were no longer shrouded in clouds. We could see more than 100 feet ahead for the first time in New Hampshire!<br>‚Ä¢<br>I about cried with relief, and all I mustered was, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt realize how miserable I‚Äôve been.‚Äù<br>‚Ä¢<br>Soon, we were buzzing with joy, vibrating and running laps around each other, taking photos and whooping excitedly. My soul warmed. We ran up to the summit to peer down on Franconia Ridge - one of the most famous views along the AT. Drifting clouds rolled over the ridge, cloaking the view and revealing it again. The fog danced and wrapped itself around ledges and little towers. Tiny people way way off in the distance disappeared into momentary voids.<br>‚Ä¢<br>One can become more grateful for five minutes of sunshine after a week rain than was ever before imaginable. I can‚Äôt put emotion into this; it‚Äôs impossible. If you know it, you know it.

In under 12 miles, it was pretty uphill most of the way.  We got some good views up top of the valley and didn‚Äôt really take much time off hiking.  When we got to Woods Hole, my new shoes and pack arrived.  My shoes were done and my joints had started to hurt about 70 miles ago. My pack wasn‚Äôt big enough to comfortably carry my winter gear and additional food, so my new Hyperlite pack should do the trick. We relaxed at Woods Hole and ate a bunch of food and leftovers for dinner. <br><br>Day 133 ‚ÄúThanksgiving‚Äù<br>Miles - 15.2<br>MM - 1567.7 to 1582.9<br><br>Walk and I rolled out from Woods Hole around 8 and proceeded to book it down the trail pretty quickly. A quick few hills and the whole day was pretty and flat. Aside from a rocky descent, it may have been the easiest day we‚Äôve had since southern PA.  We made it to Weary Feet Hostel around 2. We didn‚Äôt know what to expect for dinner, but the owner, Julie made an awesome Thanksgiving dinner for us.  Super thankful for her and the hostel today. I sat around and talked with some other hikers after dinner and relaxed the rest of the evening. <br><br>Day 133 ‚ÄúWind Sucks‚Äù<br>Miles - 18.4<br>MM - 1582.9 to 1601.3<br><br>Black Friday, we got up and had breakfast at the hostel.  Around 8:30 we got on trail. The beginning of the day was an easy, protected climb up to a ridge line.  Once we hit the top, we could hear the wind howling on the other side of the mountain. Basically the remainder of the day was spent on the ridge line on the windy side of the mountain.  It was cold and the wind was blowing hard enough to blow my trekking poles side to side as we walked. We had exactly 0 views on the day and the ridge line was filled with PUDs. It was a day that we hustled and only took one small break to eat.  We got picked up around 3 and went back to the hostel for the night.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>#appalachaintrail #atsobo #thruhike #appalachaintrail2021 #atsobo2021 #thruhike2021 #mainetogeorgia #atclassof2021

It is no surprise that I fell in love with every single hiker in this photo. Oh, how we laughed.<br><br>I hope that this day stays with me forever. We had been warned that this hostel was lacking, but what it was lacking I still cannot tell. It served me well. Rain tapped on the tin roof while we washed down frozen pizzas with cold drinks. We shared stories, sang happy birthday, and considered what to carry into the Smokies and what to mail home. When the rain seemed to stop, some of us stayed and some of us hiked on. As I climbed up into the park in the rain and the dark I realized I had broken my rule. I didn‚Äôt hug everyone goodbye. You see, one should always hug their friends goodbye because they might not see them down the trail. My heart sunk.<br><br>We had never been together like this before and this group was never all together again. And that is beautiful. The impermanence of these interactions makes the moments we shared that much more meaningful.<br><br>I did see each of these hikers again and I did get my last hugs in, some with a little trail left to hike and others in celebration of all the trail that was now behind us. Those hugs were both well wishes and gratitudes.

One month. It feels like six. <br><br>I miss the trail. I miss the good and the bad bits. The constant pushing of my limits, mental and physical. The views-even the overcast ones-they are magical too, in their own way. Being outside, in nature, 24/7. Falling asleep and waking up to the sound of the critters in the forest. I miss the people. The common goal and support we shared with each other. The complex simplicity of trail life. <br><br>There hasn't been a day in the past month that I haven't thought about the hike. It will forever be a part of me. Lessons learned, friendships made, challenges met. The realization that anything is possible, if I am determined enough. Finding truth in the statement: The fears I do not face become my limits. <br><br>I've also struggled with 'feeling' the hike over the past month. What I have come to believe is that I had expectations that once I finished the hike I would have an overwhelming feeling of accomplishment, joy and fulfillment. Expectations are often a doozy. Instead I now realize I had those feelings almost everyday while I was on trail. Each day was an accomplishment. Hitting my miles for the day, catching a sunset/sunrise, getting that hitch into/out of town. <br><br>And then it came to an abrupt end. I am grateful that my body carried me 2193.1 miles, but I wasn't relieved it was over. Why would I feel joy at the end of something so wonderful? <br><br>Those feelings I expected do come in very small waves, most often when I look back through the photos. It's then that I can feel a small sliver of the almost incomprehensible magnitude of the hike. <br><br>Here are a few pictures of those things I miss the most. <br><br>ü•æ‚õ∞üéíüèï‚úåÔ∏è<br><br>#thetrek #thruhike #AT2021 #trektheAT #leavenotrace #ATclassof2021 #appalachiantrail #moremountainsplease #optoutside #getoutdoors #hikerlife #atcspotlight #atsobo #atsobo2021 #atflipflop #atflipflop2021 #withguthook #goingfarout #adventurerecovery #hikingtheglobe #reflectiongram #afewofmyfavoritethings

I've been putting off posting this as it feels like this is really the end to the best chapter of my life, thus far. The past 5 and a half months on the AT was the most fulfilling and longest feeling time in my adult life and I really don't want that to end. But all things must end to make room for new adventures and journeys.<br><br>I don't know how to feel currently; Maine and New Hampshire feel like they were yesterday, yet forever ago. I do know I'm very thankful for all of the people who supported my journey and were with me along the way. <br><br>Mom & Dad - thanks for sending packages, supplies, and gear when I needed it on trail. Your support was huge and everything would have been much tougher without the support at home. <br><br>@robbiep.yayouknowme , @watzjohn , @em_watz14 - a special thanks from Coco for taking awesome care of her while I was gone, even though she now begs for food worse than before.... <br><br>@arepman - thank you so much for coming and visiting along the way, the AirBnBs, the resupplies, and all of the support for our little group on our path. <br><br>All the people and acquaintances I met and hiked with along the way - thank you for making this journey what it was. Everyone says the people make the trail, and I realized very early on during my hike that talking and getting to know people was my favorite part of my hike. You meet so many people from different circles and different points in their life on trail, and getting to spend time with different folks is something I'll always cherish and attempt to bring into daily, off-trail life. <br><br>Now it's onto the next chapter, back to work and tax season, and planning the next adventure. Luckily, I still have daily recaps from VA-GA to post to hold me over. <br><br>Thank you to everyone who has followed along this journey, hopefully one of many to come. <br><br>-The Mayor <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachaintrail #atsobo #thruhike #appalachaintrail2021 #atsobo2021 #thruhike2021 #mainetogeorgia #atclassof2021

Plus, my grandmother would not appreciate me having a good beer buzz early in the morning.

I filled the 2 1/2 weeks back home with visits and meals and all the catch ups thinking I was good. But, the reality is that first week off trail I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to do much of anything and ended up canceling most of my plans, which made the second week and a half extra busy. <br><br>The readjustment back into society was not easy and I‚Äôm still not quite there. It‚Äôs similar to when I finished Peace Corps, but it‚Äôs not just mental it‚Äôs physical too this time. I‚Äôm being as gentle as I can with myself. I know how important self care is. <br><br>Not only am I in an ‚Äòin between‚Äô but I also have family members on both sides of the pond who are not in great health. Not being able to be in both places is hard. Everything adds up and I feel the weight. <br><br>I‚Äôm in quarantine here in England and with the holiday‚Äôs I‚Äôm having to isolate for longer than normal since the mail is still closed here. As soon as I get that official negative test result back I‚Äôm going to try to go for a run, which is all I can think about. My body is craving it. I‚Äôm restless and feel like I could run a marathon, but I‚Äôm not sure my body is going to even allow a few miles. <br><br>If I‚Äôm not capable of that run, I‚Äôll be taking a loooong walk.

Dropped off that mountain and started a gradual climb up the next to Wind Rock. At the top, Wind Rock was aptly named and it was pretty cold.  We got a nice, cold view off of Wind Rock and set up our shuttle into Angels Rest. Once we got down the mountain we got our ride into Pearisburg and got some warm showers and headed out for an awesome Mexican dinner. We were stuffed when we got back and enjoyed our warm beds for the night. <br><br>Day 131 ‚ÄúFrozen Morning‚Äù<br>Miles - 19.8<br>MM - 1536.1 to 1555.9<br><br>After our first night at Angels Rest, we went out to slack about 20 miles. It was cold first thing in the morning - down around 20 degrees with wind. The first part of our day was a climb out of the gap, so we got sweaty right away.  At the top, we walked the ridge the remainder of the day.  On the ridge we saw one hunter who was out and that was it for the day.  Everything was frozen at the top, including the sweat in our beards.  As the day went on, it thawed out a bit, but never got out of the high 30s. We grabbed a couple nice views up top of a grassy bald and headed down to the parking lot we‚Äôd get picked up in. We relaxed a bit and had Chinese for dinner.  Sailor Jack, a 2021 NOBO, stayed with us in the bunk room, and we exchanged stories from the trail for a good bit of the night. <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>#appalachaintrail #atsobo #thruhike #appalachaintrail2021 #atsobo2021 #thruhike2021 #mainetogeorgia #atclassof2021

Tomorrow night I finish up your Triple Crown on top of Springer Mountain, and the emotions truly are crashing in. I remember hearing about you as a kid, and going on runs after rugby practice, thinking, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll hike you one day!‚Äù on all the uphills. I couldn‚Äôt imagine what it would take, but I was training nonetheless. I‚Äôve been dreaming about you for longer than I can remember. I guess it‚Äôs been my longest standing dream to experience each of your three gems ‚Ä¶ and a seemingly impossible one to carry out. ‚Äâ<br>‚Äâ<br>Sitting here at the end of it all, I‚Äôm experiencing the weight of realizing one‚Äôs earliest dreams. This moment that has played in my mind in hundreds of different fantastical forms is actually here, simultaneously a reality just as it ends. Like a bookend to a shelf of stories stretching to the horizon of my mind, the finality of it all strikes me harder than I anticipated. How can I finish something like this? How do I walk these last miles with closure? ‚Äâ<br>‚Äâ<br>There‚Äôs much to say, but I‚Äôm finding it hard to sum up. Difficult to describe a feeling that is constantly molding and shifting in this final moment. Gratefulness, sadness, elation, melancholy, motivation ‚Ä¶ thank you for them all. Thank you for teaching me strength. Thank you for teaching me weakness. Thank you for the gift of community, and that of pure isolation. Thank you for teaching me to find beauty everywhere, and for taking me to the most beautiful places I could ever imagine. Thank you for the late night grinds rolling into camp on empty, and the sunrise ridge walks filling me with energy. Thank you for the uphill plods in the blazing sun, and the downhill tramps through waste-deep snow. Thank you for the rain. Thank you for the sun. Thank you for the rawness of every moment, and the space to feel them. Thank you. ‚Äâ<br>‚Äâ<br>Though this feels like a bookend, I know it isn‚Äôt. Even though the dream may look different moving forward, it‚Äôs still there, and I‚Äôm excited to see how it manifests itself. So, for now, goodbye. Continue to change other‚Äôs worlds like you‚Äôve changed mine, and when life allows, hopefully I‚Äôll find you right where I left you.

It was taken during the first week of the hike and when I look at it I can feel all the emotions I felt when that picture was taken. <br><br>We were trail babies in that photo. Green to thru-hiking, excited with anticipation, and full of nerves. <br><br>It‚Äôs hard for me to put into words just how much of an amazing team we make, but I‚Äôll try. <br><br>We could set up/break down camp together without speaking a word. We knew when to give each other space, or a hug. We could speak to each other in the presence of others without peeping a sound. <br><br>We gave each other balance. <br><br>There were three hikes really, Snacks‚Äô hike, my hike, and then there was our hike. <br><br>Before I left for the trek, and as I prepared, I got wrapped up in the ‚Äòultralight/ultrafast‚Äô mentality to thru-hiking, there is so much hype it‚Äôs easy to do, but when I met Snacks that changed‚Äîfor the better, in my opinion. <br><br>I‚Äôd been limiting my miles at first as many do to avoid overuse injury. A few weeks in, I told Snacks it was time to turn up the pace and he said to me, ‚ÄòLast one to Katahdin wins Zipsss‚Äô. <br><br>And that was it. <br><br>A switch flipped in my brain and in that moment I made a decision to slow down. Someone recently pointed out that I was taking my ‚Äònormie‚Äô life mentality with me. Faster, stronger, quickly-quickly, tick the box and move onto the next adventure.<br><br>We already were late starters, stepping on trail May 1st, months behind the early Spring ‚Äòbubble‚Äô of hikers. Slowing down ultimately created a most unconventional thru-hike: NOBO then SOBO then NOBO again.

Surreal to have made it back down to these mountains I‚Äôve called home for years. Surreal ‚Ä¶ and sad, as the finish line is now that much closer. This journey is rapidly coming to a close, and I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm ready. Wow, the Smokies delivered though! ‚õ∞‚õ∞<br>.<br>Mid March of this year I found myself out on these same miles leading up to the Smoky Mountains on a training hike I was doing for these two thru hikes. I had connected with a friend who was just beginning his northbound AT thru, and I really was feeling all the feels. Just a month later I would set off on the CDT, and it seemed like an impossible eternity before I would walk this same section of trail, headed the other direction. Doubt was sweeping in fast. Not just at the longevity of it all, but the realization that I would probably be doing most of it alone. <br>.<br>Since the beginning of this journey, I have viewed the Smoky Mountains as something of a final checkpoint. Almost an elusive and seemingly unattainable goal ‚Ä¶ the last obstacle before the end. Catching those first views of layered mountains, endlessly folding over each other like a giant blue blanket, tears sprung unbidden to my eyes. I had made it. And though I was indeed alone, I felt as if I was in the best company in the world. <br>.<br>On the heels of that elation, the stark realization of this trip‚Äôs finality came rushing in. This WAS it. And how was I going to finish it? How can you finish it? Sitting in these beautiful but conflicting feelings in this final week ‚Ä¶ and trying to finish with peace and closure. What a wonderful paradox. <br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #at #atsobo2021 #gsmnp #smokymountains #continentaldividetrail #cdt #cdtclassof2021 #cdt2021 #atclassof2021 #at2021 #embracethebrutality #withguthook #goingfarout #sonyalpha #mexicotocanada #thruhike #backpacking #livewild

We had some coffee with what we could thaw out and hit the trail.  We had a long climb up Brush Mountain and got that done first thing.  We saw a few hunters and on the other side of the mountain, we stopped to eat and thaw out some more water in the sun.  When we tried to filter some water, both of our filters were frozen up making them unusable. We decided to call one of the hostels we passed to see if we could get a ride to a Walmart to get new filters.  Luckily, Sprocket at 4 Pines could take us.  We headed into Salem, which didn‚Äôt have any filters.  Our second stop in Roanoke had them, so we were good to go.  By the time we got the filters it was late in the afternoon, so we decided to stay at 4 Pines which was a cool hostel in a 3 bay garage.  It was toasty warm inside and we enjoyed the evening talking and relaxing. <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>#appalachaintrail #atsobo #thruhike #appalachaintrail2021 #atsobo2021 #thruhike2021 #mainetogeorgia #atclassof2021

The views were incredible and we bounced around on the cliffs for about a half mile before dropping off the mountain.  One thing I kind of forgot about until now was the way the wind moves leaves once they‚Äôve fallen and we‚Äôve been walking through some areas of thigh deep leaves.  This slows the pace as you cannot see what is below your feet.  After dropping down, we started to make our way to Mcafee Knob, which is one of the most photographed spots on the trail.

In total silence we scream our appreciation to the sinking sun, drenching the vermillion trees in even deeper red. These are the days, and we are wealthy beyond imagination. <br>.<br>As Winter settles in for good and Fall takes its exit, I thought it‚Äôd be appropriate to throw together a few of my favorite shots from those euphoric weeks spent in the Gold Tunnel with Wow. Though the beauty still persists, there‚Äôs nothing quite like these mountains in full color. Would also love to celebrate @wowiwalk, who just wrapped up the trail himself yesterday, fulfilling his 90 day goal! So stoked for you brother, an accomplishment of a lifetime.

After the awful cold day yesterday, today was warmer and beautiful.  The entire day we crisscrossed the Blue Ridge Parkway and had amazing views. Today was one of those days that you love being on trail. It was perfect weather, great views, and enough up and down to make you work, but not destroy your body.  Amy came to pick us up and we didn‚Äôt realize the road was closed, so we got to walk a bonus mile at the end of the day. We went to a different AirBnB in Catawba which was an awesome little cabin. We settled in and I made dinner for the three of us. <br><br>Day 125 ‚Äú2/3 of the Way to Springer‚Äù<br>Miles - 7.8<br>MM - 1455.0 to 1462.8<br><br>Walk and I got on trail early in the morning ready to get a few miles in and take some time to relax in the afternoon. The hike itself was fairly uneventful until we were about a mile from our pickup spot, where we hit the 2/3 marker on the trail.  Our first third of the trail took 76 days to hike, second third took 50 days, we‚Äôll see how long the last third takes‚Ä¶. When we got to the car, we stopped for some groceries and headed to the AirBnB to relax in the afternoon and evening. <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>#appalachaintrail #atsobo #thruhike #appalachaintrail2021 #atsobo2021 #thruhike2021 #mainetogeorgia #atclassof2021

The blurred together post-sunset suffer-fest will take up a large portion of this experience. I‚Äôll remember being hungry and lonely at times, aching body parts, and a homesick heart in the Shenandoah. <br>‚Ä¢<br>Mostly though, I will remember the magic that comes from Three months of walking in tune with myself. From walking with my friend, from watching the earth rotate daily, from all the trail angels who invited us into their homes, fed us, and nourished us. <br>‚Ä¢<br>I will remember rain for days and slurring my words at 1 AM on the phone, two more miles to go, stumbling and sleepy. The starlit sky shouting me onward. <br>‚Ä¢<br>I‚Äôll remember the romance and the new friends and the love of my life closest people, almost all of whom are far away right now. I‚Äôll remember frozen burritos and mid-afternoon getting twisted tea tipsy at lunch for another two-hour town stop vibe session. I won‚Äôt remember the views in the whites - there were none. I will remember twinkling city lights and too old shoes and laughing until I‚Äôm crying. I‚Äôll remember crying.<br>‚Ä¢<br>I‚Äôll remember the sunsets, how many I watched as we spun into the night, plotting along sweaty and cold and grateful. <br>‚Ä¢<br>Maybe I‚Äôll think the trail is like this one. Brief. Brilliant. They never last, sunsets. And I guess that‚Äôs what makes them so special. I‚Äôve watched a lot of sunsets this year. They come and they go, but the ones shared with friends, the ones that burned this brightly, are unforgettable. <br>‚Ä¢<br>Sometimes they‚Äôre worth sitting and watching. Sometimes, in the last fleeting moments, the magnificence calls you to sprint through the tall grass to see if you can catch it. <br>‚Ä¢<br>#appalachiantrail #thruhike #thetrek #atsobo2021

November 24th I split up from my tramily and hiked 6 miles past them to set myself up for success atop Blood Mountain. November 25th, Thanksgiving, I woke up to pee as the sky seemed brighter than it has been. I took down my food and checked the time: 4:20am (nice). Instead of going back to bed I ran the math. I could be done on Thanksgiving, the day I had said I'd be aiming for since I started in Maine. <br><br>29 miles later I caught the sunset at Springer, called some of the people I love who have supported me on this trip and told them I was done, and set up my tent for the last time. <br><br>#atsobo2021 #atsobo #appalachiantrail #atclassof2021 #hikertrash #hike #outdoors #thruhike #hikegeorgia #thruhiker #springermountain #trailtears

The warmth of the last few days have been a welcomed respite from the bitter cold paired with short days.

It was another long day of climbs out of a gap and a descent back into a second gap. This is going to be the way of VA.

It was brutal cold. We passed the Guillotine first thing and had some views on top of Apple Orchard Mountain. Other than that, we had nothing the remainder of the day.  It was brutal cold, to the point where my buff over my face froze. We got done and quickly got into the car. A hot shower was a luxury in the evening. <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>#appalachaintrail #atsobo #thruhike #appalachaintrail2021 #atsobo2021 #thruhike2021 #mainetogeorgia #atclassof2021

We joke we‚Äôre married. Walking nearly 1800 miles, step by step together, has been one of the best things about this trek. We have become each other‚Äôs friends, supports, lifelines. We have developed daily rituals and crafted intentional space that has allowed us to form an extraordinary bond. <br>‚Ä¢<br>After a magical day in Grayson Highlands, we hiked late like usual and had a cold and dewy night in our tents. There was silence between us; we had both ‚Äúgone dark, ‚Äúour way of telling each other we were going to take some quiet space. <br>‚Ä¢<br>On the walk into Damascus the following morning, Rad told me he needed to shift his priorities, that the night hiking was getting to him, that he needed to have the space to slow down if he wanted to and savor the end of his triple crown. <br>‚Ä¢<br>A couple of days later, We sat down and recorded some final interviews, sang a song together, and I hiked on, winding my way up through Rhododendron tunnels and switchbacks alone. <br>‚Ä¢<br>The last week has been the most emotional time on this journey‚Äîso much change in such a short period. I am losing my hiking partner and looking down the barrel of a lonely finish. There is sadness in leaving, but there is joy in honoring my heart. <br>‚Ä¢<br>Hiking with you has been fantastic; I‚Äôm so grateful to have met you three years ago and that the force of the universe brought us back together to have this magical time on the trail. Thanks for pushing me to grow and learn, challenging me to soften my edges, for being a mentor and a friend, and for celebrating our needs and wants, and goals. Happy trails, brother.

How do you sit in a moment and experience it ‚Ä¶ truly experience it ‚Ä¶ while constantly pushing forward on a journey like this?<br>. <br>A thru hike really is about recognizing that paradox, and finding the balance between the magnitude of the goal, and the immersion of the experience. We are all out here for a vast variety of reasons. To test ourselves, physically and mentally. To see how far we can go, when our body and mind tells us to quit. To experience isolation, and simultaneously a deep sense of community. To dwell in the wilderness, and walk through God‚Äôs endless beauty day after day. But primarily we are out here for joy, and to be true to ourselves. <br>.<br>Going into this journey, I knew there would be a tension between the pace I was hoping to set to accomplish my goal, and the inevitable desire to soak in every last morsel of beauty. Unlike a weekend jaunt into the mountains, a thru hike demands a sense of urgency and constant movement, with the changing of seasons, and sheer longevity of the objective, presenting serious obstacles. Over these months I feel a peace about the balance I was able to strike between getting the miles in, and absorbing the natural wonder around me. <br>.<br>Pushing over 30 miles a day for most of the AT allowed us to follow the warmth south, and experience the glory of Fall for weeks. I wouldn‚Äôt change a thing. However, coming to the end of these two thru hikes, and the conclusion of my Triple Crown, I find myself needing to sit in these final moments. Needing to truly absorb it. Needing to chase joy. <br>.<br>@wowiwalk and I have become brothers over these months, pushing each other through the pain, and rejoicing together in the beauty. There is an indescribable connection forged through adversity that we have gotten to share. Though I would love to experience each terminus with him, we have different goals here at the end, and respect each other enough to honor those. With deep appreciation and sadness we said our goodbyes near the Tennessee state line, and pushed on. Much love to you dude, I can‚Äôt thank you enough for the memories shared over these wild months.ü§òFinish with peace.

I completed my Appalachian Trail thru-hike! Yey!! This year, it was 2190 miles and I did the 8.8 mile Approach Trail to Amicalola Falls State Park for the pretty arch. I started June 6th in Maine and ended November 27th in Georgia! <br><br>It's surreal that I actually finished. I don't feel like I hiked for through 14 states this year. I didn't suffer like my last two 1000 mile section hikes of this trail. I ate enough calories, was well rested, and took time off for injuries/ bad weather. I did do a 29 miles on my last day to make it feel like more an accomplishment.<br><br>Thank you so much @justin_adam_may for supporting my hike so deeply! I was always comfortable and well fed. The last 1000+ miles of the trail I had the luxury to sleep in our warm van bed every night, to have pre-filtered water, to have refrigerated food, and to only carry a small day bag on my hikes. He literally drove every day to meet me further down the trail 15-30miles, did my food resupplies in town, and took care of Kiba when I didn't take him. <br><br>#appalachiantrailsobo #appalachaintrail #appalachaintrail2021 #at #at2021 #atsobo #atsobo2021 #hikemore #hike #springermountain #amicalolafalls #amicalolafallsstatepark  #vanlife

I‚Äôve found that there are 2 types of hikers this late in the game: the ones that are looking forward to the end and the others that don‚Äôt want the journey to be over. Most long distance hikers will tell you that they usually feel a combination of the two, but one side typically pulls harder than the other depending on individual-specific variables.<br><br>Onward fits in the latter category and we discussed the challenges of finishing the trail and re-entry into ‚Äúnormal‚Äù everyday life. For her and myself, the fear of having to come back far outweighs the anxiety and anticipation of starting a trek like this. Challenges like having to secure a source of income, maybe moving to a new place, and sometimes developing completely new social circles all the while trying to avoid the pitfalls of your old life that drove you to the trail in the first place can seem overwhelming. Most thru hikers turn their lives upside down to chase this dream and ensuring a smooth post-trail transition can help to reduce the post-trail blues. Talking about this helps me just as much or more than the hikers I talk to and I‚Äôm grateful for the opportunity to meet and speak with Onward and all of the other hikers from this year.<br><br>Congrats to Onward for making it this far and to her inevitable successful completion of this thru hike!

Was still tired after sleeping all night and didn‚Äôt feel like hiking.  Got going slowly and proceeded to get my butt kicked by small climbs. This section of VA after Shenandoah has been very up and down elevation wise. I spent some time thinking about why my attitude was shifting and my thoughts were lack of calories and needing some easier days. We made it to a shelter and started to look at options to head into town for a bed and some decent food. We decided to call it a day at a gap about 12 miles in.  We got picked up and headed into Lexington for an afternoon off. We got some food and relaxed for the evening. <br><br>Day 120 ‚ÄúMost Amazing AirBnB‚Äù<br>Miles - 12.3<br>MM - 1375.5 to 1387.8<br><br>After our night in town, Amy came down to visit and took us to trail late in the morning after I rested (and ate) off my bad mood.  We planned a short day to give our bodies a quick break. The hiking was pretty easy and more downhill than up. Amy came and got us on some brutal dirt road.  When we got to the AirBnB, it was amazingly unique. The house had a modern look to it in the middle of nowhere VA. The art and layout were one of a kind. We settled in, enjoyed some hot showers, and crashed for the night. <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>#appalachaintrail #atsobo #thruhike #appalachaintrail2021 #atsobo2021 #thruhike2021 #mainetogeorgia #atclassof2021

Here are some lovely photos from my hike through the Great Smoky Mountains National Park during my thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail this year.<br><br>Ahead of going in you need to buy a permit on their website. For thru-hikers it's $20 and you don't need to designate your intended camp spots. If you're just backpacking the park you'll need to plan in advance where you'll stay. Check out their website if you want to learn more! The shelters are rather large. In non-COVID life, they had tarps up to act as the 4th walls and block the wind. All of the ones I've see have fireplaces too. <br><br>The picture with "2000" written out in sticks designated the 2000 mile mark for me on my hike! The whole trail is about 2197 miles this year!<br><br>I met a nice man in the park who hiked in 1993 and was named Earplugs. He spent 5 days snowed in a shelter in the park and thought earplugs for a helicopter ride were food. <br><br>#appalachiantrailsobo #appalachaintrail #appalachaintrail2021 #at #at2021 #atsobo #atsobo2021 #hikemore #hike #TennesseeTrails #smokymountains  #smokynationalpark #greatsmokynationalpark

Blazing sun, clear skies and friendly, roaming ponies greeted us as we climbed up into the beautiful, rolling hills and crags of this singular stretch of trail.

We had a few small hills and a slow descent into the gap to get into town.  When we got into town, we stopped at the post office and got a bunch of boxes. Followed that up with a stop for pizza which ended up being enormous slices.  We resupplied and relaxed in a hotel room for the evening. <br><br>Day 117 ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs Someone‚Äôs Dog‚Ä¶., That‚Äôs a Bear‚Äù<br>Miles - 17.4<br>MM - 1328.7 to 1346.1<br><br>We ran a few morning errands in Waynesboro and made it back on trail around 10:30.  The day was much warmer than we‚Äôve had the past few weeks and the terrain was smooth for the first bit of the hike. We stopped at a great shelter for lunch and we‚Äôre just worn out and not moving quickly. We had some of the easiest climbs I can remember right after and walked into the evening.  As we came up one of the last knobs we ran right into a bear about 30 yards from us. My first thought was it was someone‚Äôs dog in the woods, but instantly knew it was a bear. It didn‚Äôt seem overly concerned with us as we were close to some houses and it likely wanted a meal from the trash. We slowly moved past the bear and kept rolling. Our last two miles were in the dark and slow over the rocks, but we made camp and set up quickly with a warm night ahead. This was my first night in the Altaplex and it fits much better than my duplex did. Excited to catch some more nights in the tent. <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>#appalachaintrail #atsobo #thruhike #appalachaintrail2021 #atsobo2021 #thruhike2021 #mainetogeorgia #atclassof2021

"There are a lot harder things to do than thru-hiking together," as if it's nothing. What a great woman! And you know behind every great woman, is a good-hearted man like Crawl.

The cold slowly takes over as fall morphs into winter, stripping the trees and chilling the air. It‚Äôs an intimidating reality, but the gradual shift has been a beautiful display of diversity and natural alteration. It‚Äôs been pretty wild to be immersed in each stage of these mountain‚Äôs yearly evolution. <br>.<br>Climbing from the rolling hills and farmland of the mid-Atlantic, up into Shenandoah National Park, we started to realize that fall was quickly dissipating. Leaves tumbled around us, and the forest rapidly thinned into naked, twisted branches against a cold sky. Though the magical colors we had been moving through were leaving, new views and scenes opened up as we got clearer windows to the broader world around us. Through the skeleton trees, the contours of endless mountains began to take shape, and instead of just getting expansive views once or twice a day, we were looking out at massive landscapes from within the forest. A subtle but beautiful gift of winter. <br>.<br>Despite the cold, we are holding up well, and still getting the miles done we were hoping to. Ahead lies Greyson Highlands, and the Smokies, through which we will probably hit some significant snow, and harder terrain. It‚Äôs getting real, but we‚Äôre keeping spirits high, and stoked for this next adventure! 18 days from the end of this journey, if we are to hit our 90 day goal, and one question continues to play through our mind: ‚Äúcan we keep this up through what‚Äôs to come??‚Äù The AT continues to amaze and challenge us. <br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #at #atsobo2021 #continentaldividetrail #cdt #cdtclassof2021 #cdt2021 #atclassof2021 #at2021 #embracethebrutality #withguthook #goingfarout #sonyalpha #mexicotocanada #thruhike #backpacking #livewild

I had been wanting to do a sunrise on Max Patch since I first heard about this spot years ago. Unfortunately our mileage for the day didn‚Äôt allow for a sunrise, and I didn‚Äôt want to kill time just to make it happen (it‚Äôs cold out here!) As we got to the parking lot after going over the mountain, we met Biscuit doing trail magic and ended up staying for‚Ä¶ a few hours, and then camped with her too. After we ate the best  quesadillas I‚Äôve had ever had, she drove us back up to Max Patch and we ran up the mountain with wine in hand to catch the sunset. It was even better than I could have imagined! And I didn‚Äôt feel bad about not going the extra 4 planned miles for the day. Ditch the plan and go with the flow, because these experiences are what the trail is all about.

Time on a clock doesn‚Äôt really matter out here, more of a gauge than anything else. The sun came up and the guys in camp got the fire rolling, which helped us thaw out a little more quickly.  We ate quickly and rolled intent on getting our first 26 mile day in. We cruised the first part of the day and stopped at the shelter in the middle of the day for lunch. We did real well holding 3 mph throughout the day.  We also hit 1300 miles somewhere in the middle of the day. The last few climbs into camp slowed a bit, but we felt good and got into camp before dark. We talked a bunch with the section hikers in camp and turned in after a bit.  I had a hard time sleeping since I was housing Mio energy throughout the day, but eventually I drifted off. <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>#appalachaintrail #atsobo #thruhike #appalachaintrail2021 #atsobo2021 #thruhike2021 #mainetogeorgia #atclassof2021

It ended with Damascus,the last VA town going south and location of Trail Days. <br><br>For AT thru-hikers the Virigina section is said to be the "Green Tunnel", the longest state on the trail and the reason for many northbound hikers end their hike early. I didn't feel any of that! @justin_adam_may Trail support via our van made my hike my most relaxed yet! He drove me into towns when I wanted food, met me at road crossings for lunch, and helped when I was exhausted.

The views in Shenandoah have been amazing and they kept coming. Every viewpoint was spectacular. We walked quickly to the stony man parking lot to part with Joel for the trip. Walk and I made it to Skyland Resort and had lunch and waited for Easy. When he showed up, we decided to head back to open arms to avoid the cold night. Once we got back we got some pizza and crashed fairly early. <br><br>Day 113 ‚ÄúWe Lose Easy‚Äù<br>Miles - 17.3<br>MM - 1261.6 to 1278.9<br><br>When we got up in the morning, Easy had a hard time getting out of bed and told us to press on without him today. We encouraged him to get to a doctor and have his ankle looked at. While he was doing that Walk and I continued South.  Since we were slackpacking, the hostel gave us some smaller packs for the day. I got this awesome unicorn pack and rocked that all day. We hustled during our hike as we set out to get a little over 22 miles done in 7 hrs.  It was cold to start and the water on the rocks was frozen into icicles. We had a nice view or two and saw some deer as we moved along, but for the most part, it was an easy green (brown, orange, and yellow) tunnel day. We got a text that our ride back to town would be early so we had to cut off early. When we got back, we got the news that Easy had a severely sprained ankle and needed some time off trail to heal. We were all pretty bummed, but ate dinner and got ready to leave the hostel for good in the morning. <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>#appalachaintrail #atsobo #thruhike #appalachaintrail2021 #atsobo2021 #thruhike2021 #mainetogeorgia #atclassof2021

Dolittle's injury, entering the American health care system, and the subsequent wrangling with insurance has been just one facet of the stress of returning to civilian life. The sudden end and non-completion of a goal that's been years in the making is just devastating. The hole in our lives where the trail had been these past months is gaping and impossible to fill. Other thru hikers will know, but it's hard to get across how much spending an extended time in the woods changes you physiologically, emotionally, and socially. How can you replace the daily endorphin rush from crushing miles and climbing mountains? How can you avoid feeling overwhelmed by yr soundtrack changing from the song of the wind in the trees to the cacophony of modern life? Waking up in one place, falling asleep in another; every day with new challenges to overcome. The community, the people & names in log books. The simple joy of an existence revolved around moving forward in space and time; running south to try to outrun winter.<br><br>We needed a chance to check in with each other and stop a descent into the post-trail blues. <br><br>Philly had always been a city I'd  wanted to hit up.

We saw a bunch of wildlife today. I kicked up a bear on the way down the mountain into Front Royal.  It made a ton of noise as it ran off.  We also saw a nice buck inside the Smithsonian conservation area right before we got into town.  The Mountain Home and Cabbin were right off trail and we got settled in for the night before heading into town for Mexican and to resupply. <br><br>Day 110 ‚ÄúRainy and Cold Start in Shenandoah‚Äù<br>Miles - 13.4 <br>MM - 1221.1 to 1234.5<br><br>We left the hostel around 9:30 to get on trail. We were slow because we planned a short day and it was a cold and rainy day. About a quarter mile into the day, Easy‚Äôs ankle starting hurting him real bad and he turned back to stay another day at the hostel to rest his ankle. Walk and I started our rainy and cold ascent into the mountains. We didn‚Äôt stop during our hike. It was a brisk 40 degrees and rained steady on us until about 3 PM, about when we made it to the shelter.  We got out of our wet clothes, set up, and ate.  We were in our bags around 4:30 and asleep by 6.  It dropped into the mid 20s that evening and was pretty cold outside, but comfortable in my quilt.  It was easily our coldest day and night on trail. <br><br>Day 111 ‚ÄúJoel Hikes Along with the Boys‚Äù<br>Miles - 14.3<br>MM - 1234.5 to 1248.8<br><br>Walk and I started to thaw out from last night around 7ish. We were slow to exit our sleeping bags and slower to get on trail for the day.  As soon as the wet and cold clothes from the day before went on, we got rolling.  We met our buddy Joel in a parking lot about 2 miles from the start of our day and got to hiking. The Shenandoah section has felt very uphill for us SOBOs and the trend continued. We stopped at the wayside to grab some real food and decided to head into Luray for the night to warm up and let Easy catch up. We had some beautiful views of the valley and eventually made it to the parking lot and got picked up.  We had dinner at a little grill in town and relaxed at the Open Arms Hostel, which was a great stay.

We discovered that our sleep systems are great in this weather and prefer to stay in our tent on cold nights rather than shelters because it keeps us warmer. The recent time change has also made a big difference in our schedule and now we get up at 4:30am to make sure we are done with our hike before sun down. Getting out of our sleeping bags in the mornings gets much harder in these cold days but we know the end is near and we must keep pushing through it in order to make it home before Christmas! ü•æüèî‚ùÑÔ∏èü•∂üèï<br>#chewsoutdoors #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains  #atsobo2021 #appalachiantrailthruhike #atclassof2021 #optoutside

We stopped at the ATC to get our pictures taken and started hiking into the clouds that remained from the rain yesterday.  We made it across the Shenandoah river and bounced between WV and VA a few times.  The terrain remained rocky, but we made pretty decent time rolling ahead to camp. We entered the rollercoaster in VA which is a series of climbs and descents that are one after the other for 13 miles or so. We had planned to get to Bears Den for the night and ran out of daylight about 3 miles out.  We hiked into the hostel in the dark which was a cool stone castle in the middle of the rollercoaster.  It was an awesome stay, for $35 we got a bed, laundry, shower, frozen pizza, ice cream, and a soda‚Ä¶.not too bad. We settled in for the night and enjoyed our time inside. <br><br>Day 108 ‚ÄúVA Rollercoaster‚Äù<br>Miles - 18.3<br>MM - 1187.6 to 1205.9<br><br>We got up at Bears Den and Easy made some pancakes for breakfast. We had the majority of the rollercoaster and some more miles after to go.  The rollercoaster was not super tough, just more tedious how you are up and right back down for 10 miles without views. The highlight of the day was getting under 1000 miles to Springer Mountain and the end of our trip.  It felt great, but reminded us we‚Äôre still a long way from the end. <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>#appalachaintrail #atsobo #thruhike #appalachaintrail2021 #atsobo2021 #thruhike2021 #mainetogeorgia #atclassof2021

There seem to be a bunch of SOBOs around us again as we met a bunch of new folks today. The hiking itself was uneventful as far as views and such go.

It was a grind, but we made it into town around 5 and ran into AYCE who we haven‚Äôt seen since the middle of Maine. We caught up and headed back to the van where Amy had some dinner for us which was awesome.

We seem to be hiking just fast enough to reach the end of peak foliage in one section, before plunging into new areas just as they start to change colors. A pretty magical and unique way to experience an AT thru hike, and I‚Äôm grateful we somehow timed it as perfectly as we did. <br>.<br>@wowiwalk and I are over 1,300 miles in now, and as we work through the undulating mountains of Shenandoah NP, the first significant bites of Winter fill the air. Yellow orange leaves tumble around us all day, as the skeleton trees slowly take shape, and frost crunches under our feet during early morning starts. Our beautifully prolonged Fall does have an end, and though that brings a certain sadness, the cold season ahead offers new scenes to behold, and challenges to overcome. We‚Äôre here for it, and ready for this new, wild chapter. <br>.<br>Song: ‚ÄúThe Long Walk‚Äù by Jamie Norwood <br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #at #atsobo2021 #continentaldividetrail #cdt #cdtclassof2021 #cdt2021 #atclassof2021 #at2021 #fall #embracethebrutality #withguthook #goingfarout #sonyalpha #mexicotocanada #thruhike #backpacking #livewild

Slow enough that we only made 4 miles by 11 and got to a tavern that was open for lunch. We grabbed a burger and moved on after.  The rest of the day was pretty flat and easy, and we got about 15 miles in after noon.  We got into camp and set up while it got warmer out in the evening as a front moved in.  This was our last night in NJ and we had a great setup in a wide open campsite. <br><br>Day 102 ‚ÄúWalked Home from Maine‚Äù<br>Miles - 13.8<br>MM - 883.4 to 897.2<br><br>It rained all night and I got some water in my tent for the second night in a row. My duplex is just not long enough to keep me 100% dry and as it keeps getting colder, I‚Äôve got to dry dry when I‚Äôm in the tent. I spent a fair amount of time in the morning thinking about what tent I should get to wrap up this trail with. The last bit of Jersey was stupid rocky, but we moved well through it even though we were socked in a cloud all day. As we cross the 80 bridge into PA l, the magnitude of the hike sort of started to set in.  I walked home from North Central Maine. It‚Äôs a hell of an accomplishment, but I‚Äôve still got Georgia on my mind. We drove my truck home to take a day off. Grabbed a ton of Wendy‚Äôs and rolled home. I stopped at my parents‚Äô to eat dinner and at my sisters‚Äô to get my dog. After visiting, I went back to Walk‚Äôs to sleep for the night. <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>#appalachaintrail #atsobo #thruhike #appalachaintrail2021 #atsobo2021 #thruhike2021 #mainetogeorgia #atclassof2021

I hit the NJ state line after a few miles and was up on rock balds for a good bit of the morning.  The hiking was pretty tough and rocky. I went down the stairway to heaven and headed into the farmer‚Äôs market for some grub.  I met Easy and Walk there and the band got back together.  We grabbed some hot dogs for lunch from a stand and headed back out. We hiked a couple flat spots and went into Unionville for the evening. We stayed in a park near the community center. We also grabbed dinner from a Tavern in town and had a good time eating and jamming to tunes on the jukebox. <br><br>Day 100 ‚ÄúFirst Cold Snap‚Äù<br>Miles - 20.1<br>MM - 845.3 to 865.4<br><br>We woke up and got some sandwiches from the general store in Unionville and started on our way out of town. It was the coldest day of hiking we have had on trail. We hit the high point in NJ in the morning and stopped at the state park office to grab a soda. Or the most part, we kept moving all day so we didn‚Äôt get too cold.  As we approached camp we saw that the shelter and tent sites were packed with groups of people.  It was also starting to rain so we got set up quick. The temperature dropped quickly and it ended up being a cold and raw night in our tents. <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>#appalachaintrail #atsobo #thruhike #appalachaintrail2021 #atsobo2021 #thruhike2021 #mainetogeorgia #atclassof2021

This was a section I did almost exactly 4 years ago, taking about 10 days to complete. My friend Sofie, who I met on the Colorado Trail, lives near Franklin and shuttled me to Springer and then Fontana. This time around, she picked us up from Tellico gap. First we walked 29 miles non-stop from Fontana to NOC, 8 am to 6 pm in the cold and rain. This probably set a new record in death marching for me but was worth it to achieve a warm, dry place for the night. My kayaking friend from Miami, Donna, picked us up from the NOC to deliver us to her beautiful cabin in the woods, where a hot meal of beef stew filled our bellies and replenished our souls. I could not have asked for a better ending to compensate for a hard day...when it's raining for days, what else you gonna do? Not hike in the rain? Not us. <br><br>We began the second day with smaller expectations. 23 miles tuned into 8 thanks to the persistent rain and multiple options to get into Franklin. Sofie hiked up the trail a bit to meet us and it was great to get to walk with her again, if only too short. That makes 2 CT tramily members that have hiked on the AT with me this year, the other being @yoyo_onthe_trail <br>We had a great stay with Arthur and Sofie in their new and amazing house and also visited my favorite trail brewery, the Lazy Hiker. Outdoor 76, a fantastic outfitter store and Sofie's previous employer, hooked me up with an AT patch and even printed the CDT and PCT logos so I could decorate my Triple Crown. Burger King provided the crown. We had fun watching all the kids strut around downtown in their Halloween costumes. I sadly went dressed as a hiker. Later we had a wonderful meal of black bean soup and cornbread... comfort food, much needed for the cold. Thanks so much to Donna and Sofie for sharing their lovely homes with us and feeding us some delicious home-cooked meals.<br>Sunday was back to business, with the clouds finally breaking mid-day to reveal the spectre of colors from Wayah bald. Similar grandness was had at Alberts Fire tower the next morning. Then on into GA, 14th, pretty uneventful for the next 3 days. The end.<br>#atsobo2021

I had two amazing breakfast sandwiches and resupplied for a couple of days. We hiked hard during the day and got to the bridge over the Hudson, which was neat to walk across.  We ate lunch at the base of Bear Mountain and I drank a couple cokes before heading up.  We crushed the mountain southbound, which was really cool as it was almost all rock steps. There were also signs and info on all sorts of different trails and ways to maintain a trail. At the top, we relaxed for a few minutes and headed back down.  The south side of the mountain was a little less pristine and tougher hiking, but we got it done and hit our 1000 mile mark on the trail.  Once we made it to the shelter for the night, we decided to head down to a road crossing to go into a hotel. This ended up being more of an adventure than we anticipated. When we got to the road we had absolutely no service, so we couldn‚Äôt get a ride.  It was also very dark by this point to add to our challenges. I threw out my trusty thumb and in the first set of cars that drove by, a dude in a Miata stopped and asked if we needed a ride.  Obviously, 3 guys weren‚Äôt fitting in the car so I just asked for a ride to a spot with service and jumped in. He took me up the mountain and I got an Uber ordered.  The Uber took almost an hour to get us, but we got into the hotel around 8:30 and relaxed. <br><br>Day 97 ‚ÄúMigraine Day on Trail‚Äù<br>Miles - 7.9<br>MM - 798.5 to 806.4<br><br>I woke up in the hotel with a horrible headache and told Walk and Easy to go ahead and get on trail without me. I took all the time I could resting and grabbed an Uber to trail. I was good for a short bit on trail, but my headache returned and made it hard to focus on anything else.  In the afternoon, I decided to go back into town and do my best to rest it off in a dark hotel room. <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>#appalachaintrail #atsobo #thruhike #appalachaintrail2021 #atsobo2021 #thruhike2021 #mainetogeorgia #atclassof2021

I'll go back to those pics soon. But since my Springer Summit photos sucked (it was cold, rainy, and I was by myself so I didn't stick around to celebrate), here are a few shots from the Amicolola Falls approach trail. This for me was more of a finish than Springer. It was still rather subdued but allowed for a peaceful moment with the sign...Maine to Georgia. The way it's supposed to be all my SOBO friends. I reached Georgia on my 100th day, so that was cool. Wish I could have done the whole trail in 100 days but my excessive zeros got in the way. I don't have the energy to reflect on the whole experience right now but will try to post some thoughts and highlights later. But here's one that came to mind: I started and ended the AT in the fog and rain, as so many do. These points were arbitrary because it was all that was in-between that mattered. #purplerainskirts #atsobo2021

We headed to Delaware Water Gap to leave my truck there and Amy took Walk, Easy, and me back to the train station north of Pawling, NY. We stopped on the way through Pawling and grabbed some subs and tacos before starting our short hike around 5 PM.  It took about 25 minutes and the sky got black for a thunderstorm. It rained on us for the last two miles into the shelter and all night while we slept.  We settled in and got a good night of sleep. <br><br>Day 94 ‚ÄúRPH Grub‚Äù<br>Miles - 16.8<br>MM - 744.4 to 761.2<br><br>With having a little less than 17 miles planned, we got out of camp super late, around 8:45. The day had a few nice views and was fairly rocky.  We had a lot of small ups and downs to walk through but nothing too difficult. We go into camp a little after 4 PM and ordered pizza to the shelter. It is starting to drop in temperature and we played a couple games of crazy 8s and went to bed early. <br><br>Day 95 ‚ÄúMexican Food at Graymoor‚Äù<br>Miles - 18.8<br>MM - 761.2 to 780.0<br><br>Heading out from a great night at RPH, we had a steady and easy climb up to Shenandoah Mountain, which had some great views at the top.  We relaxed for a minute and then pushed hard hiking throughout the day. It was a pretty flat and groovy day with some small climbs and rocks, and we made it into camp before dark. Camp was at Graymoor Spiritual Life Center‚Äôs baseball field.  We grabbed a quick Uber to a local Mexican restaurant and had a really good dinner. <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>#appalachaintrail #atsobo #thruhike #appalachaintrail2021 #atsobo2021 #thruhike2021 #mainetogeorgia #atclassof2021

I hitch back to Winding Stair Gap and am walking by 2pm.... in the rain.<br><br>On the way to Carter Gap shelter I meet and walk with Pinestake, a 73yr man on the last leg of the AT and his triple crown.  We talk about other trails - GET, Hayduke, ODT, PNT - and our experiences on them or plans to do them.  Cool dude. <br><br>Pinestake stops early for the night and I continue on to the shelter, arriving just before dark, setting up with four other thru-hikers including Khatapault, who I met earlier on the trail in Maine before she flipped. <br><br>Its only 25mi to Around the Bend hostel so I sleep in, leaving when it's light enough to keep my headlamp stowed.  At Deep Gap there is Trail Magic! Little Foot, HoJo - 2012 Nobo's - and their 8mo old are waiting at the parking lot and I am their first customer.  We sit and talk trail while I eat homemade banana bread and other treats.  I leave 1.5 hours later, hoping the 5 hikers behind me come in soon.<br><br>Along the way I meet Sugar, a lost bear hunting dog.  Two nobo section hikers found her and are taking her back to the owner.  She is so sweet, loving the attention and the beef jerky I give her.  I am not sure I could have given her back. <br><br>At the hostel there are four more thru-hikers including Sundae.  We met at Shaw's in Maine early August, sitting around a campfire.  Khat, now Sundae, its fun to meet others you've crossed paths with at the beginning again so close to the end.  69mi to go and I'm now in Georgia.<br><br>#atsobo <br>#atsobo2021

Even though I've hiked through them before, as well as done several shorter hikes when I first started backpacking, there were still new things to see and do. This time I passed the 2000 mile mark on the AT and I finally got to see views from Clingmans Dome, highpoint of the AT. I was 0 for 2 on previous attempts. And I hiked the 77 miles though the park in 3 days...a section that took me 5 days in 2017. A big part of the fast push was to beat some weather and take advantage of one day of superb conditions. The first day was pretty much a wash, fogged in and mostly all climbing from Davenport Gap to a nearly full shelter at Pecks corner. It was very cold but thankfully the rain let up mid day. The next day brought frost on the ridge but clear skies. We did our longest day, 29 miles, to see as much as we could. Charlies bunion, trail magic at Newfound gap, and Clingmans dome were all on the agenda. Tourists abounded until past the dome, then all went quiet. We got to Derricks knob shelter right at dusk, relieved to find only one other person. A cold wind blew dust all over us as we slept overnight and I left early to try to beat the rain the 3rd day. I got some cool views of a red sky from Rocky Top, battling gusts of 50 mph on top. Tree branches were crashing down all around me and even the leaves stung when they whipped into my face. I climbed the rickety Shuckstack fire tower, feeling it violently sway and shudder in the wind. The views were worth the terrifying ride  Then finally on across the famous Fontana dam, a walk I'd done several times before but this time brought tears to me eye for all the good memories. The rain started and I inhaled 2.5 burritos at Fresh Ground's setup, my first full-blown, on trail cookout of trail magic after 8 thru hikes...a perfect day and series of accomplishments for such a reward. #purplerainskirts #atsobo2021

The day is one of the coldest, windiest, and wettest on the trail. The only way to stay warm is to keep moving. We luck out and are able to get a cabin in Neels Gap at the last minute. There was never a day we needed a warm place to stay more. The cutest and cuddliest cabin with a fireplace. And a stuffed otter. The best night of sleep. We wake to rain again, but push on for another wet day. But we stay warm and positive and find a sweet shelter all to ourselves for the last night on trail. We reminisce about the trail and tuck in for a cold night. <br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #zebratales

The leaves and views are breathtaking as ever. We pass into Georgia: our last state on the trail. We push a big day and make a last minute decision to hitch into Haiwasse to hit up a local brewery. Our ride lets us know that he has a loaded gun and will use it if he feels threatens. First time I've heard that one. Welcome to Georgia. We gorge on delicious Mexican food and spend the evening trying to warm up standing around the outdoor heaters. We get a ride back to trail late and set up our tents in the dark. The next day we wake to a misty morning, but have a beautiful day when the sun pops out. It's a lot of climbing, but we push hard and hitch into Helen in the afternoon. The end is near and we are taking every opportunity to make the most of every day of the trail. And Helen just happens to have an Oktoberfest going on. My mom has points at a hotel and hooks us up with a room. Thanks Mom. We spend the evening walking around town and enjoying all the Oktoberfest festivities. Everyone is dressed up and we join in the dancing and entertainment. We find a local joint at the end of the night and sing karaoke and have the time of our lives. <br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #zebratales

The day is full of the most beautiful views. We have a host in Franklin to stay with and we spend a relaxing evening playing with her cats and dogs and eating a delicious beef stew and watching Hocus Pocus to get in the Halloween spirit. The next day we slack pack an easy 12 miles and climb a sweet lookout tower that is cloaked in fog. We pass another milemarker. Only 100 miles left. Another night in a bed with our host and more homecooked food. So thankful for a warm place, a bed, and hot food on a rainy day.<br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #zebratales

Later it started raining but I made it to Standing Bear hostel for a dry roof over my head for the night. Next stop Great Smokey Mountains National Park. #purplerainskirts #atsobo2021

I have gone beyond hiker hunger to Ludicrous* hunger.  By Springer I may get to Plaid.*<br><br>The rain that I woke to eases and I start walking, quickly climbing a high narrow ridge ... and it is beautiful.  The mist mingles with the fall colors,  sometimes muting, sometimes saturating the autumn hues.  The fog is isolating, removing distractions, focusing attention to the thin winding path forward.  I think to fully experience this section it has to be walked twice, once with clear skies and commanding views<br> and once as it is now.  But always in the fall and always SOBO :)<br><br>After reaching the peak the trail tread improves, the grades reduce and the rain restarts.  2 out of 3 isn't bad.  Fueled by town food I cruise, passing the shelter at 23mi, my original planned endpoint, and walk the additional 4.5 to Winding Stair Gap and hitch to Franklin, ordering my first meal by 7.<br><br>Endnote: I came across bear hunters and their dogs on the AT at Telico Gap. There is one less bear in the woods.  I didn't add it to the text above as it interrupted the flow, the mood.  One of the hunters said this is their 9th bear this season.  I've walked 2000+ miles and only have seen three.  Four if you count dead ones <br><br>*Spaceballs<br><br>#atsobo<br>#atsobo2021

The climb out of 325 was easy and gradual, but once we needed water at Peters Mountain Shelter, it was anything but easy. The trail to the spring behind the shelter dropped down hard for .2 miles, reminding us of Maine.  Once we got our water and ate some food, we kept moving. The initial descent into Duncannon was super rocky and tough, but once we got through those scrambles, it was easy switchbacks the rest of the way. The last few miles were a road walk through the town of Duncannon.  We were done fairly early and made our way back to Drew‚Äôs to relax for the night. <br><br>Day 91 ‚ÄúNero Day to Relax‚Äù<br>Miles - 13.3<br>MM - 1044.5 to 1057.8<br><br>Easy and I set out early to get a quick 13 miles in and relax as we knew we had a longer day and a travel day upcoming.  Drew was going to hike the whole day with us until traffic was atrocious and we didn‚Äôt get to the trailhead until 9 AM.  He hiked up the mountain to Hawk Rock with us. We enjoyed the view above the clouds and got some much needed sun up there.  After he left, Easy and I moved really quickly to hike through some more of the rocky PA green tunnel.  After our hike, I went to visit some family and friends in Hanover. We stayed with my parents to make our drive easier in the morning. <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>#appalachaintrail #atsobo #thruhike #appalachaintrail2021 #atsobo2021 #thruhike2021 #mainetogeorgia #atclassof2021

In this section we went over The Priest Mt. which is our first 4,000ft mountain since New Hampshire.

Its cold and clear, moonlight illuminating the shelter. And the wind has been blowing all night drying the path forward. And my socks. Yes, dry socks!  Finally I will get to see some this national park I have been walking in.<br><br>The sunrise is going to be gorgeous and I rush up the mountain hoping to get to a bald and capture the color.  But since entering the Smokies, the trail has gotten tougher, steeper, more rocky and I don't make it in time.  At the top I pull out my Peak Finder app and scan the horizon looking at names and elevations.  So many "balds" and "knobs" and "domes" yet to cross.<br><br>On the way to Fontana Dam I take the side trip to Shuckstack tower - worth it.  then head to the marina store for resupply to NOC spending 1.5 hours there charging stuff and gorging on frozen burritos.  I leave for the shelter still hungry.<br><br>At Cable Gap Shelter I am greeted by 8 section hikers hanging around the fire. I quickly setup my tent and join them.  Talk of the fire is tomorrow's weather. Per my NOAA app:  rain and 30+ mph sustained winds with  50-60mph gusts. I booked a bunk at NOC and plan to get there before the worst of it hits. <br><br>When I get service in the morning the updated forecast is light rain and reduced winds compared to yesterday.  The sky does not fall and I walk the 22.5 to NOC and am ordering a beer just before 2pm.  Let the feast begin.  I think maybe I should have walked on instead of staying.  But then I look at the menu again and think about dinner instead.<br><br>#atsobo<br>#atsobo2021

Today was another terribly boring day with minimal views and flat, rocky hiking.  We did see some big black snakes today, though. We got out of camp in the morning super late, and walked quickly to the shelter. We got in, ordered pizza and milkshakes, and played cards a bit before heading to bed.  Tomorrow starts our week or so of being home and slackpacking the remainder of PA.<br><br>Day 84 ‚ÄúEasy‚Äôs Dad Comes to Visit‚Äù<br>Miles - 11.4<br>MM - 997.1 to 1008.5<br><br>We hiked a short day from 501 to Swatara Gap and Easy‚Äôs dad flew in to see him, so he picked us up.  He got a hotel in Carlisle, so I had Drew come pick me up and I went to his house. My truck had a flat tire so we drove Drew‚Äôs car to get my computer from Aaron and Court‚Äôs, stopped at my parents‚Äô for dinner, and picked up my dog from Emily‚Äôs. We went back to Drew‚Äôs and had AAA come out to fill up my tire.  The slackpacking in PA begins tomorrow. <br><br>Day 85 ‚ÄúDrew Hikes Along‚Äù<br>Miles - 17.4<br>MM - 1008.5 to 1025.9 <br><br>We had a long day planned and went to the hotel to grab breakfast. Drew hiked along with us. The most exciting part of the day was getting through the beaver dam.  Otherwise, it was a flat and rocky day in the PA green tunnel.  When we got to the finish, I went with Drew back to his house to stay. We played some Rocket League that night and hung out before crashing for the night. <br><br>Day 86 ‚ÄúBoiling Springs Flat Hike with Company‚Äù<br>Miles - 11.6<br>MM - 1057.8 to 1069.4 <br><br>Easy‚Äôs Dad and Amy walked with the group of us through the flat section in Boiling Springs. We walked through some cornfields, roads, and pastures. Otherwise it was an easy and boring day.  Thankfully we had company.  We ate at Cafe 101 after and the food was great.  I went down to Aaron and Court‚Äôs to hang out and see their kids that evening.  We also decided to zero the next day to recover and enjoy early Thanksgiving at the Repman Ranch.

At the SB kitchen,  I score two MH meals from some section hikers getting off trail so I am set to Fontana Dam. <br><br>Shortly after entering the Smoky Mtn National Park the forecasted precip comes early and I walk most of the way to the shelter in rain and mist.  Its good to get in late as the 6 section hikers already have a fire going.  I do my part, break a few longer branches, then jury rig a drying rack from trekking poles and everyone loads their socks to dry. <br><br>I wake and slip out into the cold before anyone else stirs.  As I climb through the mist and fog to the high point of the AT, Clingmans Dome, ice formed on the tree tops breaks and falls to the ground.  Something is always falling from the trees on this trail: Now ice, before that acorns, before that walnuts. The highpoint is crowded, but at least the weather clears for awhile and the views are decent. <br><br>Along the way to tonight's destination, Derrick Knob Shelter, I pass the 2000mi mark. Getting close. At the shelter I meet a crew of 8 on an REI trip, 2 guides and 6 clients.  One of the guides is a AT NOBO finisher from 2019 and two of the clients are from CLE so the evening is full of fun conversation,  some box wine, and I even score a Pad Thai BC Pantry meal - my favorite of all time.  Good day.<br><br>#atsobo<br>#atsobo2021

Feels like we are saying goodbye to a new member of the family. It feels so good to hike with real food in my stomach instead of hiker food, aka sugar. I fly up and down steep mountain climbs and make it to the NOC mid-afternoon where we sip a few beers and stuff our faces while watching tourists drive by on Harleys, kids dressed up in costumes painting pumpkins, and kayakers doing flips and spins in the river. We hang out as long as possible and when the sun starts to sink behind the mountains we start the climb. It's always a climb out. But the late start is so worth it to catch the sunrise on a ridgetop. We find a group of section hikers huddled around a fire when it gets dark, but decide to push on in hopes of an epic camping spot. We blast music in the last miles of the day to motivate us and find the most epic camping spot ever. A totally exposed lookout tower with a 360 view. The moon pops up and it is the brightest and biggest moon I have ever seen. The ultimate star gazing. The cold threatens to be a rough night, but the views win out and we cowboy camp on top of the lookout anyways.<br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #zebratales

It's a freezing cold day of walking. A few sips of leftover whiskey helps take the edge off the westher. Thankful for the uphills just to warm up. The sky finally clears in the afternoon and walking across Fontana Dam is glorious. As I'm crossing the dam, a van pulls up and asks if I'm a SOBO. The owner is the infamous Fresh Grounds who has found us to do trail magic. He makes fresh burgers, fries, and burritos for us. Fresh Grounds owns a non-profit and spends over half his year finding thru-hikers to follow around for a few days at a time and feed. Such a blessing after a rough day. There is a shelter nearby with a bathroom with a hot shower. Such a treat. Fresh Grounds feeds us breakfast the next morning too. Bacon, pancakes, eggs, potatoes and of course all the fresh ground coffee. And a beautiful lake sunrise too. We have a fast day hiking fueled from real food and we meet Fresh Grounds at a road crossing where he takes us into town to resupply and then cooks us other amazing meal of fried chicken and stir fry. And then he sets up his projector and we cuddle in the cold with hot cocoa and watch a movie projected on the van. Another day of being blessed by this trail and it's people. <br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #zebratales

Its brilliance lasts for such a relatively short time, but that brevity really defines its magnificence. ‚Å£<br>‚Å£<br>One of the joys of a late season SOBO on the AT is that you get to sit in that glorious sunset for weeks. Following the warmth south, we have the opportunity to experience fall colors as they also slowly work their way towards Georgia. We started seeing noticeable change in southern Maine and northern New Hampshire, as the green canopy exploded in a stunning array of reds and oranges. By the end of Vermont it seemed like we were pretty much in winter ‚Ä¶ the fall had ended and the trees were just skeletons against a gloomy, gray sky. Not going to lie, it was quite depressing, and I felt like winter had arrived prematurely. While I wasn‚Äôt stoked to see all the leaves gone, winter does offer a certain appeal, as you can then see loads of views through the bare trees that are completely unnoticeable during the summer and fall. But it wasn‚Äôt over quite yet. ‚Å£<br>‚Å£<br>Resigned to our fate we pushed on through the cold, grey landscapes, until, almost immediately after crossing the state line, Massachusetts threw us back into a world of green and yellow. In the span of a couple days, the forest transitioned from near total decay, back to lush, vibrant life. We had caught up to Fall. The foliage continued to thicken as we rushed through the relatively easy terrain, cajoled forward by the stark reality of winter we had just escaped, hearts rejuvenated by the colors once more popping around us. ‚Å£<br>‚Å£<br>While the biting chill will eventually catch us, we are relishing in these magical scenes while we can, and soaking up the last gifts of autumn. Living in, and deeply enjoying, the present, despite an unknown and often foreboding future, has been an integral tool against negativity and doubt during this journey. Learning how to enter that mindset is a continual exercise, but I‚Äôm thankful for the process. The AT is unreal and I‚Äôm beyond grateful for it.

We hiked up to Bake Oven Knob, Wolf Rocks, and the Knife‚Äôs Edge and spent the majority of the day on rocks of all sizes. Our feet were really beat up so we got a late lunch at the Thunderhead Lodge restaurant and got a room at a nice BnB for the night.  We stayed at the Shanty at Blue Mountain, which was a beautiful homestead owned by a sweet lady.  We watched some football, showered, did some laundry, and played cards. <br><br>Day 81 ‚ÄúLong Day in the Rain‚Äù<br>Miles - 20.6<br>MM - 946.7 to 967.3<br><br>The humidity came back in overnight. We had a great breakfast at The Shanty of bacon, eggs, and blueberry pancakes and got a ride back to the trail around 8. It started raining on us around 10:30, and continued for about an hour and a half.  It was another flat hiking day in PA with one easy climb in the middle. We stopped at the Eckville Shelter in the middle of the day to eat lunch and started our climb to the Pinnacle.  It cleared on our way up and we had great views at the top. We made it down off the mountain and go into camp around 5:45. <br><br>Day 82 ‚ÄúSide Trip to Cabelas‚Äù<br>Miles - 14.7<br>MM - 967.3 to 982.0<br><br>The hiking was incredibly boring today aside from a short, but very steep climb out of Port Clinton. We took a side trip to Hamburg in the middle of the day to walk through Cabelas, grab some food from Micky D‚Äôs, and hit Walmart for some odds and ends. We made it into camp around 6 after messing around in town for a few hours. We met a SOBO flip flopper, Hitch at the shelter.  I recognized him from the Barn Hostel in Gorham. The thru hiking community is a pretty small group and I have remembered most of the people we met in one way or another. There were also two NOBO section hikers in camp, and one of them got lost on the way to the privy and had to call the fire department to get him back. It was an exciting night in camp to say the least!<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>#appalachaintrail #atsobo #thruhike #appalachaintrail2021 #atsobo2021 #thruhike2021 #mainetogeorgia #atclassof2021

It involves a 31-mile traverse of the stunning glacial ridgelines that make up the Eastern Continental Divide. It's a bit more rugged than other parts of VA, but boy was it worth it. We touched lucky with some awesome late Autumn sunshine that made the forest colours really vibrant and accentuated the contours of the ridges to make psychedelic looking geometric waves.<br><br>The best part of hiking it Southbound is that you really get a sense of perspective of where you're going. Picture 3 shows Catawba Valley from Tinker Cliffs. We traverse the ridgeline to the left to catch sunrise over McAfee Knob, which illuminated the Blue Ridge Mountains we crossed last week. We then dipped back down into the valley to traverse the other side to scramble up to Dragon's Tooth; aptly named with it's cool rock structure.<br><br>These hikes can be done all as one as an epic endurance challenge, but most people treat each one separately as the equivalent of taking a day to climb Moel Famau or Scafell. For thru hikers, it's just another couple of days in the majesty of this awesome state. Besides The Whites in NH, these were some of the most epic climbs we've done in a while.<br><br>More to come as we head into the Highlands of southern VA and down into Tennessee and North Carolina.

Suicidal and self harming, I was consumed by a monster depression. Hospital visits, psych wards. Programs. Pain and shame had talons in me. I started my journey of recovery with the help of my family. I am so grateful and privileged to have them be able to support me and keep me safe from myself. I didn‚Äôt want to hurt. I yearned for peace. Craved it. But I thought I didn‚Äôt deserve it.<br>‚Ä¢<br>At some point, after a lot of external encouragement and love, I decided to go to work and change my story. And so I fought to survive myself, painfully at times, and allowed other in to help me. And things changed. <br>‚Ä¢<br>Eventually I found my way to the trail. In the last three years, thru hiking has given me so much. Power in my story. Confidence. Patience. Acceptance. Perspective. Perseverance. Community. Healing. Victory.<br>‚Ä¢<br>A while ago I was talking to someone about the hardest thing they had ever done. The most challenging physical and mental feat of their life.

But then I thought ‚ÄòI used to want to kill myself‚Äô and if I can get through that I can get through anything.‚Äù<br>‚Ä¢<br>One of the hardest things about this journey is the grind of it. The pre-dawn wake up and then getting to camp in the dark. Every day feels like two. And it‚Äôs so beautiful still. It feels magical and disordered. This is how it will happen. In the dark and cold and snow and sleet and hail. But it will also happen in the light and the sun and the warmth of a new morning. Light always comes back. The darkness always fades.

Sunday I leave before the stores open stopping at the first shelter to make coffee at a picnic table with a group of women section hikers.  The usual questions ensue: How far are you walking per day, how do you afford this, how old are you?  I answer, even the last one, and one  jokingly asks for my ID telling me "Hey engineer, your math must be wrong.". We talk some more then I leave, feeling very flattered.<br><br>Later a group of 6 section hikers stop me asking me about my pack and if I am day hiking.  They ask how far I am going today and are surprised its almost 3X what they are walking.  I explain hiker legs, pack weight and they could do the same if their part time job - walking trails - was the same as mine.  They leave feeling better about their walk.<br><br>Next is random trail magic at a trailhead: water and homemade cookies. Later,  around 3pm, I get a text from Fresh Grounds, a famous AT trail angel. He asks for my location.  1.5 hours later I am at a road crossing eating freshly made brats and a veggie stir fry.  I feel honored as he knew I was likely the only thru-hiker he would meet at this spot.  He knew I was aiming to catch sunset on Snowbird Peak and pushes me down trail with two more brats for dinner.  As I leave, two section hikers show up and Fresh Grounds starts cooking for them.  Thanks Zebra for connecting us!<br><br>I make it to the peak for a gorgeous sunset then continue another 4mi in the dark.

All the ridgetop walking and beautiful views. We take our time and enjoy every new viewpoint. End the day at a packed shelter with a bunch of chatty section hikers so we find a spot to comboy camp on a pad of pine needles and watch the practically full moon fill the night sky. A cold night in the elements, but the briskness is refreshing on my face as I synch up my quilt as tight as can be. The sun pokes through the trees in the morning to wake us. We have a quick 3 miles down to the road where we encounter all the tourists. It's peak "leaf week" out here and everyone is out to take pictures of the changing colors. Three tour buses in the parking lot. We luckily score a ride into Gatlinburg despite all the weird looks from the tourist's cars as we are hitching and find even more of a tourist mess in town. We can't help but laugh as we walk through the strange attraction of the city. We resupply and eat and get a ride back from a sweet young couple on their honeymoon. We hit the trail and climb up to the highest point on the AT: Clingmans Dome. More tourists. We cheers each other and are the life of the party. We push on into the afternoon and run into friends we haven't seen since the beginning. We hit the 2000 mile mark at sunset. It's a night hike into the shelter and a late dinner. Another amazing day on the trail.<br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #zebratales

Tennessee is great. There are huge mountains with grand views, amazing Trail Angels, hostels galore, and cute animals at every one. We stuffed our faces with the biggest and best breakfast ever, stuffed my pack with a surplus of section hikers' leftovers, and hauled it all up Roan mountain to camp at 6205', highest camp on trail so far. There I shared my bounty with a poor old hound dog that sniffed out a sucker for sad puppy dog faces. The full moon danced the night away with the wind and fog while I huddled in my tent to stay warm ( I did). The next day we busted out 33 miles to make it to the Nolichucky river and rafting resort. There we got bunks for $15 each, effectively renting the whole bunkhouse since we were the only ones in it. This place had a SAUNA and a fireplace, where we relaxed after a hard-earned day, listening to the rain pound the roof. Earlier in the day we had reunions with Marlene Simpson and Bob Peoples, Trail angeling and maintaining. What saints these 2 are. So lucky to have met them...twice! #atsobo2021 #purplerainadventureskirts #purplerainskirts

After the rain, the day is clear and cold. The cold is great for the climbs, but bone-chilling every time we stop. The leaves are still gorgeous, we can't believe we picked such a great time of year to be here. We camp outside another host's house and they feed us dinner and dessert and we meet so many amazing people. I even meet a guy who hiked the PCT and is now opening a hot dog and ice cream stand for hikers on the AT. We end the night with a hot fire and stay up til midnight talking. We plan to get up early the next day, but accidentally sleep in and rush to pack up quickly when we finally wake up and practically run a couple miles to get up to watch the sunrise on Max Patch. We make it just as the light is turning colors and enjoy a gorgeous breakfast watching the sunrise and huddling together to stay warm. We book it up and over ridgetops and have a long downhill to Standing Bear Hostel where we stop in for a quick resupply and to charge our stuff. As always, it's a long climb out of all the hostels and the cold day is much appreciated. We enter the Smoky Mountains, a much awaited part of the trail and get to a busy hut at dusk. Lots of section hikers. We answer all the fun thru-hiker questions and enjoy a cold night of old men snoring. <br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #zebratales

One of the best camping spots on trail. We chug coffee because we're almost out of food and then we do a quick morning hike into town where we spend a wonderful evening with a local host. Homemade dinner, warm beds, and a hot shower. We even manage to break the toilet somehow (can't take thru-hikers anywhere). Eggs and sausages for breakfast and then we spend the day slack packing in a downpour. We run the trails to stay warm and end up in the town of Hot Springs in no time where we try to get warm by restaurant and beer hopping around town. Back to our hosts for a much needed hot shower and more amazing homemade food and a great night with some amazing people. <br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #zebratales

Then, sometime after midnight, a single gunshot.  Probably one less bear in the woods I am walking in.<br><br>I am up early walking to sunrise on Big Bald.  The moon is full, bright but most of the light is blocked by the trees. In the desert on such a night, one could walk without headlamp through the monochrome landscape.  But not here. I miss the desert.<br><br>Sunrise almost didn't happen.  Clouds and mist blowing over Big Bald were rushing east to block the great yellow orb.  But the sun won and the scene was brilliant. <br><br>After an hour watching the clouds and sun play, I continue trekking south.  At Sam's Gap I meet two dayhikers from Omaha.  They had read about the AT and hungry hikers and were excited to meet one.  They brought extra fruit and Kind Bars in hope of handing them out.  I was honored to be their first trail angeled hiker. <br><br>There is a fire waiting at Jerry's Cabin Shelter when I get there. Sobo's Brightside, Jukebox and Jesse-2-Time have been there for awhile.

Can you drink too much coffee?<br><br>The TN trail is much the same as VA: Overall good tread, gently graded switchbacks, lots of water.  Its cruisy and fun.  Especially today as the route follows  a river full of cascades and a large falls.  At the Mountain Falls shelter I see No Box and two section hikers.  I cook dinner there, eating by a fire.  I am tempted to stay but continue to my planned site next to a falls.  The cascading water drowns out all other sound and it becomes so quiet. Sleep comes easy.<br><br>I wake earlier than normal and set out for the Mountain Harbor B&B. <br>Descending into the the valley where the B&B is located, I follow the path of the settled cold air. It is frigid.  I push my pace to stay warm making the 9mi before 8am, just in time for the "best breakfast on the AT". After 3rds I would argue maybe the best breakfast ever.  Between bites I meet 6 more Sobo's and Flip-Floppers.  The standout being Jesse-2-Time, a calm friendly Brittany Spaniel.<br><br>Sated, I top off my food to get to Erwin and hike on.  The trail climbs sharply up to the Hump Mtn balds passing through high treeless grasslands and gorgeous views of where I have been and what's ahead.  To the south the profile of Mt. Mitchell stands out.<br><br>At 6270ft elevation, I pass the highest and likely coldest shelter on the trail: Roan High Knob.  Camp tonight is 5+ mi further, 2000 vertical feet lower and much warmer. <br><br>Eating breakfast I am serenaded by a chorus of coyotes.  A first on this trail.  The trail passes through the Emerald Forest, a large stand of pines.  Between the trees, I see nothing but tent sites; beautiful, pine duff floor tent sites.  So soft to sleep on.  I want to take a nap.<br><br>Along the way to Erwin and Uncle Johnny's hostel I meet Marlene the trail angel.  Sobo trail magic is always a surprise and so unexpected.  And I am her only hiker today. Town can wait.  We sit and talk for almost an hour, about the trail, her motivation to trail angel, my motivation to walk<br><br>I get to the hostel before 7pm.

Trail still wonderfully maintained and loads of rewarding viewpoints. This section saw us going through several wilderness areas including the Priest and James River Face and parts of the George Washington and Jefferson National Forests. The leaves haven't peaked yet but each day is more beautiful then the last - golds, deep reds and purples where there was previously a green tunnel. We crossed the James River by the town of Glasgow and spent a night in a shelter in the town centre complete with hot showers - another amazing Virginia trail town providing for the hiking community.<br><br>This section has also allowed us to meet some amazing local folks - shuttles drivers, day hikers, RV campers. Its apparent to us how strong the hiking community is in this state and how fiercely proud some are about that.

The NE PA rocks hit us almost immediately. The miles prior to and after Wind Gap have to be some of the worst in PA for the rocks. On our climb up out of Wind Gap, Walk and Easy both lost the trail and ended up on the wrong side of the mountain. After we got everyone back together, we pressed on. Walk took a hard fall on some rocks and gave both Easy and me a pretty significant scare, so we decided to quit early on the day to make sure he was alright and relax a bit before some harder days to come.  We played some cards and talked with the other folks in camp. <br><br>Day 79 ‚ÄúLehigh Gap‚Äù<br>Miles - 16.9<br>MM - 917.1 to 934.0<br><br>Today was super flat, but very rocky.  The rocks slowed our pace a bit, but we still made good time. The highlight of the day was the rock scramble down into Lehigh Gap.  The views were incredible and we loved this little piece of Maine and NH in Pennsylvania.  Doing this a second time with those states under my belt made it feel much easier.  Easy and I went into town to resupply and grab some food and met Walk at the next shelter for the night. We met two other SOBOs there, Krueger and Brodie. <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>#appalachaintrail #atsobo #thruhike #appalachaintrail2021 #atsobo2021 #thruhike2021 #mainetogeorgia #atclassof2021

I pop my umbrella and continue on.  At a viewpoint I stop and face east to watch a race between the sun and the clouds.  If the sun crests the horizon first, it will be a brief but truly brilliant sunrise.  The clouds win and the sky goes dark.  Still it was worth the wait to capture what could have been. <br><br>At lunch I stop at a shelter to get out of the wet and find Puddles hanging out waiting for the weather to pass.  We catch up while eating.  Soon after the shelter fills with section hikers seeking refuge from the downpour. <br><br>Eventually the rain relents and I start walking again.  The clouds break, the sun shines through.  It almost feels like the day resets.<br><br>I walk the 30 to the  Boots Off Hostel, grab a tent spot, shower and pizza where I meet No Box and chat to almost hiker midnight.

Had two S.E.C.s from the gas station and headed over to the trailhead. I walked those miles pretty quickly and near the end I passed into NY for the final time since the trail bounced between the NY and CT border a few times.  I got back into town and got some awesome subs from the deli behind our hotel room and relaxed the rest of the day. <br><br>Day 77 ‚ÄúMoving down to PA‚Äù<br>Miles - 6.4<br>MM - 897.0 to 903.4<br><br>We got up in Pawling, NY ready to head out and we talked a bit about when we‚Äôd be home based on our schedule.  We decided to flip down to Delaware Water Gap, the beginning of PA, to be home a little sooner (and closer to the middle of our trip). Our plan is to finish off PA and go back and do NY/NJ right after we hit the MD border. The spontaneity was exciting as we boarded a train to Grand Central Station in NYC.  Even cooler, Easy had never been to NYC. We walked from Grand Central to the Port Authority bus terminal and caught a bus to Delaware Water Gap. Once we arrived, we walked into town, grabbed some good BBQ, and headed up the trail.  We climbed a small mountain and made it into camp around 6.  That was a long and fun day, and we are HOME. <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>#appalachaintrail #atsobo #thruhike #appalachaintrail2021 #atsobo2021 #thruhike2021 #mainetogeorgia #atclassof2021

The next day is more steep climbs, with some more epic views. And some chocolate trail magic. The south has been tresting us well. We hang out on Big Butt Rock for a bit and sing Sir Mixalot and torture ourselves talking about all the food we are craving. We push on past an empty shelter, taking a chance we might find a stealth camp on an exposed ridge. We don't find a stealth spot, but we do find one of the most gorgeous sunsets ever and a long evening of star gazing, cloud watching, and moon watching. We cowboy camp right on the trail.

The alpacas Winnie and Moonshine ham it up and get most of the attention while Fiona, well she was just her a-hole self. The others just stare and chew their cud.<br> <br>Sometimes it's hard to leave a place and this is one -alpacas, lap cats, good coffee - but eventually I head back to the trail.  The path passes through a pasture where I am greeted by Cow #44.  The others clear the way but #44 approaches, sniffs me, then licks my hand. I suspect she may have gotten treats from other hikers.  I would offer a Clif Bar but did not want a head butt in return. <br><br>I catch up with my hostel mates for lunch at the Mt Rogers Rec Area HQ then continue on, making dinner at Trimpi Shelter then stealth camp several miles south on a high ridge.<br><br>I wake, pack and head south to Grayson Highlands.  Along the way I catch up with Puddles.  She tells me of her bear encounter at Hurricane Shelter last night.  A bear woke another hiker sleeping in the shelter, caressing his leg through the sleeping bag.  Maybe the hiker was snoring?  The hikers in the shelter wake and start yelling and the bear wanders off and starts banging on the bear box before going away.  Another good reason to stealth camp in seldom used spots.<br><br>Just before Grayson Highlands there is trail magic.  Drifter and The Hun, '21 Nobo finishers, are there to magic Renaissance.  Anvil, Puddles and I are all beneficiaries.  Now off to see the ponies. <br><br>I have seen pictures of people surrounded by ponies while walking through Grayson but that is not today.  All good because the high grasslands and rock outcroppings provide excellent views of the fall colors I have been walking under. <br><br>In light of the recent bear encounter and the fact there are many  tenting in and around the shelter, I again cook there and walk on, stealth camping at the edge of a high meadow. <br><br>#atsobo<br>#atsobo2021

I am out of food and need to get to town.<br><br>The rain stops and fog lifts as the trail descends to the road that will take me to town.  The first car picks me up and carries me to second breakfast at the only diner in Pearisburg where I find Defcon and her partner. We all sit and talk trail and consume a truckload of calories.  I resupply, stick out my thumb and immediately score a ride back to the trailhead.  Easiest two hitches ever. <br><br>I walk another 11mi to Woods Hole Hostel before the next wave of rain, find a bunk, then chill in what is so far my favorite hostel on the trail.  Communal dinner and breakfast, 4 friendly dogs and 2 cats to pet, all in a beautiful setting, this is a place I will come back to.  Can't say enough good things about Neville and the vibe she has created at her place.<br><br>In the morning I delay my walk back to trail waiting for the rain to slow, eventually leaving before 10, umbrella deployed.  I walk with Hot Sauce until Trent's Grocery where we both get food from the grill.  Hot Sauce is staying at another hostel nearby but I am continuing.  Leaving Woods Hole I had 80 miles to my  next stop, an alpaca farm, and 2-1/2 days to get there. <br><br>Tonights camp is on a high ridge and I can see stars for the first time in awhile.<br><br>#atsobo <br>#atsobo2021

It allows me to break up the overwhelming sum of miles into mentally manageable chunks, and provides soul-rejuvenating milestones aside from the ultimate finish line. Not only that, but they‚Äôve helped me view these journeys as more than just completing a trail, or standing on a finish monument. It‚Äôs all the little moments in between that constitute the overwhelming beauty of a trek this long, and give value to the time we spend out here, even if we ‚Äúfail‚Äù to make it the entire way. I guess they provide a beautiful sense of peace in the moment, and train your mind to look towards what is happening right now, instead of what may happen in the future.

It allows me to break up the overwhelming sum of miles into mentally manageable chunks, and provides soul-rejuvenating milestones aside from the ultimate finish line. Not only that, but they‚Äôve helped me view these journeys as more than just completing a trail, or standing on a finish monument. It‚Äôs all the little moments in between that constitute the overwhelming beauty of a trek this long, and give value to the time we spend out here, even if we ‚Äúfail‚Äù to make it the entire way. I guess they provide a beautiful sense of peace in the moment, and train your mind to look towards what is happening right now, instead of what may happen in the future. So here‚Äôs to the micro-goals reached ‚Ä¶ whatever those may be.ü§ò<br>.<br>Pushing into Vermont with new stoke, as now the trail gets MUCH more manageable, and we aren‚Äôt just hopping over rocks or scaling slabs all day. To finish on time we‚Äôre going to have to crank through the mid-Atlantic, and already the terrain has allowed us to push the miles we were hoping for. This state is also affectionately known as ‚ÄúVermud‚Äù though, so it‚Äôs not without its challenges lol. Come what may, we‚Äôre moving on with full hearts!<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #at #atsobo2021 #newhampshire #vermont #whitemountains #continentaldividetrail #cdt #cdtclassof2021 #cdt2021 #atclassof2021 #at2021 #embracethebrutality #withguthook #sonyalpha #mexicotocanada #thruhike #backpacking #livewild

The wind threatens to blow us off a dam that we have to cross, but we survive. We walk around a gorgeous lake and make it to Boots Off Hostel mid morning where we chow down, resupply, and dry our soaked gear out when the sun finally comes out. We finally pull ourselves away and have a gorgeous and hard day climbing up through the hills and passing an epic waterfall along the way. We make it to a shelter at dusk and luck out having it all to ourselves. The next day threatens thunderstorms, but we only end up with a little rain. It's a fast 19 miles into Roan where we just happen to end up at Station 19E hostel on karaoke night. All the locals come out, there's a dancing cow, a grim reaper on stilts, and we sing and dance the night away. <br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #backpacktennessee #zebratales

Now that we are down to the last month on trail, we are trying to slow down and make the journey last as long as we can. We finally finish our jaunt through Virginia, the longest state on the AT, and ring in Tennessee in true hiker trash fashion. We have an easy 10 mile day to a shelter, getting dumped on for a bit along the way. We work our butts off to get a fire going with wet wood and enjoy a warm night and some dollar store box wine to go with our ramen and potatoes. The rain threatens all night, mostly just making a lot of noise on the shelter's tin roof and doesn't really start until we are ready to hike in the morning. We have all the ups and downs today as we cruise a ridgetop and make it through the day mostly dry. We have been lucky enough to have the shelters mostly to ourselves recently but are surprised to find a packed shelter where we plan to camp for the night. We pop down the ridge instead and find a much less windy spot to camp and eat before the night fog and rain comes in.<br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #backpacktennessee #zebratales

I'm too mesmerized to take pictures. Smash and I spend the whole day tromping through the Grayson Highlands with all the tourists. Wild ponies. Views for days. Rocks to climb. The rain hits at the end of the day and we book it to a shelter and find Sunshine, Longshot, and Pappi and an epic fire. The next morning is wet and we hit the Virginia Creeper Trail which we walk into Damascus. It's a beautiful morning walk along the river. All of our friends end up at the hostel and we finally have a decent size bubble of SOBOs. I buy new shoes (my fourth and hopefully last pair of the trail) and do the usual Dollar General resupply. Payback is a bitch and I get iced with a 22 oz. Smirnoff Ice ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è We throw our old shoes into the hostel shoe tree and spend the afternoon sipping beers, eating, and playing games. Pappi treats all of us to dinner at the local diner and we finish the night off watching a movie on the hostel's projector.

Nice to have someone break the webs.<br><br>The trail climbs into a cloud on the way up to the Dragon's Tooth, the third jewel in Virginia's AT Triple Crown.  Today it is shrouded in fog.<br><br>Have to say I am liking the VA trails. In general the tread is less rocky and the switchbacks well graded allowing for bigger miles even in the shrinking hours of daylight. <br><br>The trail passes through pasture and by the Keffer Oak, the largest on the southern half of the AT.  Old, gnarled, and full of stories, it looed like it needed a hug.<br><br>I get to Laurel Creek Shelter and find a single tent setup behind the structure but no one inside.  Yes! Rain threatens so I am happy to get under a roof and to not pack out a wet tent in the morning.<br><br>It starts just after 4AM, pinging on the steel roof, sometimes a drizzle, sometimes heavier.  This will be the pattern all day with a few breaks in between. <br><br>The wet trail makes for quiet walking and I sneak up on my first bear on the trail.  Initially walking away, it turns and starts back down the trail.  I start to pull my phone from the pouch but in this moment the Velcro closure is deafening as it realeases.  The bear stops, sniffs the air and sees me 25 meters away and scampers off in the woods. <br><br>Camp tonight is with Oracle, another Sobo, at the Rice Field Shelter.  Heavy mist moves in before sunset followed by on and off rain.  I am again happy for a roof and a dry tent to pack out tomorrow.<br><br>#atsobo<br>#atsobo2021

We trade the owners our leftover uncooked potatoes for fresh eggs. We hit the trail and have a beautiful morning walk. Until we stumble upon a Mexican restaurant. Definitely a must-stop. We resupply at Dollar General, trading Little Debbies to optimize our sugar options and pack some Yuenglings out before heading out. We trade the rocky trail for a bit for a beautiful fall road walk and end up at one of the coolest shelters on the AT thus far. We order pizza just because we can get it delivered and slip into food comas when it gets dark. A chill day follows. We take our time enjoying the forest. I chase cows. A friendly day hiker gives me a caramel apple. So many people at the campsite for the night as we get closer to the Graceland Highlands. <br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #backpackvirginia #zebratales

Longshot makes an epic fire to keep us warm over our Top Ramen dinners. We pass some interesting fairy villiages today. Always something interesting going on in the south. The guys take off early the next morning and I have the camp to myself in the morning. A cool morning to walk up to Chesnut Knob where we are greeted with the most entertaining shelter artwork and a gorgeous view. We wander through glorious ridgetop fields and dark rhododendron tunnels. We laugh and scheme and daydream and have way too much fun. We find a hostel right on trail and six of us cram into a tiny 100 year old house. No TV. No wifi. We manage to laugh our hearts out anyways. We pick pounds of potatoes and eat to our heart's delight. And sleep soundly in the quiet old country cabin. <br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #backpackvirginia #zebratales

Rocking the trail. I just want to also say what a crap platform Facebook has become. Along this journey, I've been locked out of my account 5 times for "suspicious activity." Just for posting pictures of my hike. Something in the faceless algorithms has not liked my geographic movement from one place to another. That or some troll is maliciously tagging my posts as spam...once this happens FB automatically assumes your account has been hacked and there's no way to contest the spam allegation. It's ridiculous and has been a huge waste of my time. I put my energies into my own personal blog and wish I could bypass FB and insta entirely. The hiker groups are the only useful thing about Facebook anymore. The rest is toxic garbage. Thanks for listening to my rant. Sometimes I think we'd all be better off if Facebook went down permanently... #atsobo2021

We are walking through mangrove tunnels every day now and I can't believe how jungly Virginia is. We make a last minute change of plans and push on to Woods Hole Hostel, because we have heard it is possibly the best hostel in trail. It does not disappoint. A delicious dinner, a group meditation, a fire, games, the comfiest bunk, an epic sunrise in the morning, home roasted coffee, a healthy and scrumptious breakfast, the friendliest cats and dogs, and the sweetest people. We never want to leave. But eventually we do and walk through more mangroves and find a fun waterfall to jump into. We find a random boondockie cafe store and grub down and pack out a couple beers before heading to a shelter for the night with another epic fire, lots of laughs and stories, and a new game we come up with called Gross or Not Gross, where we vote on whether all the hiker things we do are indeed gross or somehow deemed normal.<br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #backpackvirginia #zebratales

We finally make it to the shelter and find Mashed Potato who I am stoked to see after a few days apart. We make an epic fire inside our stone hut and snuggle up to its warmth and comfort. The best night of sleep I have had on trail in awhile. The next day is cruising through more beautifulness and I get into town in the afternoon.

There were some more gargantuan climbs in this stretch but I'm on a roll, not mountains, rain or bobcats gonna slow me down. That's right, I saw a little bobcat on trail and even got a blurry picture of it. I left at noon on Saturday and still made 23 miles! Wasn't paying attention and marched into a 10 mile waterless stretch with half a liter...So kind of had to do some extra miles. Camped alongside the broad James River, where Great horned and eastern screech owls called all night over the white noise of a nearby highway. 11 miles of climbing up and over 4225' Apple Orchard Mtn...took all morning but was a nice haul. No apples but found some chicken of the woods mushrooms. Also safely passed through the Guillotine. Took the Best blue blaze yet late afternoon to a campground that served up a chicken sandwich, peach milkshake, and Devil's Backbone lager. Wow what a spur of the moment and unexpected treat! I paid penance to the trail gods for my deviation later. 1.5 miles from my planned shelter, thunder boomed and rain hailed down from the sky. I marched in the darkness, rain, and flashes of electric death for the last mile of the day. Forgive me for I have sinned...but it was still worth it. I cheated purgatory with my umbrella and a shelter roof for the night. #purplerainskirts #atsobo2021

On the walk into the brewery I noticed a dining area reserved for dog owners and request a table there. Score! I get seated next to a large Bernadoodle.  Really -  does everything crossed with a standard poodle turn out awesome? <br><br>I get an easy hitch back to trail and am walking southward by 3:45.  I see a tempting blue blaze that cuts out 4 trail miles along the Three Ridges but stay the course on the red line.  Tomorrow I will confess my trail sins at the Priest and I don't want to add this one to the list. Camp tonight is at Harper's Creek Shelter  with Showman and Lifeguard.<br><br>In the pitch black morning, a large hornet crashes into my tent screen, attracted to my headlamp.  I turn it off and the hornet finds my stove and sparks fly as its wings ignite.  I turn my headlamp on and another hornet hits my tent, the vibrating wings as loud as a small drone.  I must be close to a nest  These things are big and I wonder if the sting matches the size. Not wanting to find out, I prep everything in the tent then turn my lanp off and pack up in the dark and sneak out. <br><br>The trail climbs up to the The Priest, the first 4k+ mountain since Killington in VT.  A short side trail leads to The Priest Shelter where hikers  confess their trail sins into the shelter log book.  I pen my sins into the logbook for the Priest and all the hikers in my wake to read.<br><br>Camp tonight is with Infomercial and Old Army at the Brown Mtn Creek Shelter.  Absolution from my trail sins brings restful sleep as I elevate my feet on my food bag. <br><br>#atsobo<br>#atsobo2021

As previously mentioned, we chose to walk north after a week of rest and day hikes from Dolittle's parents' house in northern VA while the Diplomat healed an injury.<br><br>The best part about our northbound week was running into loads of southbound hikers we hadn't seen for months - shout out to All There, Poles, Magnolia, Tropical, Solo, Mr. Clean, Froggy, Tipper and their crew. Also shout out to Tarzan and crew, nice to meet you guys! We got to run back into some of our friends we had been hiking with on our last day in PA as well - such a treat to see Dad Jokes, Stand Up and Scunch again :)<br><br>We completed the 41ish miles of Maryland which included historical civil war sites and a beautiful sunset on Annapolis Rocks. We stayed and walked through some of the prettiest shelters we have seen on the trail so far and met some great day and section hikers. We then crossed the Mason Dixon line on the trail into PA. Southern PA didn't disappoint with well maintained trails and a few little challenging sections. <br><br>Back to Harpers Ferry, WV this weekend to spend time with family and visit the AT Conservancy in town. Tomorrow we start to head southbound again from where we left off South at Front Royal to continue all the way to Georgia! We've got some miles to complete in PA/NJ after we finish but we'll cross that bridge in December - we may not end up with the complete 2193 miles but we'll be pretty damn close! üòä<br><br>#atclassof2021 #atsobo2021

We both feel rejuvenated from the past week's miles, even more so from the chance to walk North and see some old faces we hadn't seen in hundreds of miles, and other new faces we may see further down the line.

Sages Ravine was right after I crossed into CT, and that as well as Bear Mountain were both gorgeous as well. The second half of the day had some serious Maine vibes and I loved it.

My simultaneous entering and exiting photos kind of sum up my experience. The park flew by. Or rather, I flew through it in 3.5 days, 105 miles. I've done 150 miles in 5 days. I hiked my longest day on the AT yesterday: 35 miles. I've just been in a groove, having a great time and enjoying both the trail and some road walking in order to take in the views. The weather has been perfect and I couldn't have asked for a better experience. I will definitely come back again, maybe take things a little slower. I'm on a short break in Waynesboro to resupply then onto Lexington VA to visit a CDT trail friend, Open @bry.anwalsh  The AT is an awesome trail. So lucky to be out here. #purplerainskirts #atsobo2021

The rain has finally stopped, the weather is cooler and glorious and breezy, and we have good water sources in a dry section thanks to the recent downpour. We are more than energized with all the excess calories and breeze through a beautiful day of ridge top walking and enjoy a break on Tinker Cliffs. We spend a while at the iconic McAfee Knob, probably one of the most photographed spots on the AT, and enjoy the epic views. It's a cold night by the time we make it to camp and we wake to one of the coldest mornings thus far on trail. It's all the rocky climbing today, but climbing up the Dragon's Tooth Cliffs makes it all worth it. It's so nice to be in the sun for a change. I push on by myself at the end of the day to stealth camp on a rocky ridge and catch a pretty sunset view. <br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #backpackvirginia #zebratales

But we only have 11 miles into town, so rain is the least of our worries. First stop in town: food. The first Mexican food I've had in over two months. My heart is happy. Then it's a hysterical resupply. We all end up buying a ridiculous amount of sugar. One of the guys has a NOBO friend in town and she lets all six of us crash at her house, use her car, and basically take over her one bedroom apartment. We are so thankful because the rain kicks into full force throughout the day. A few of us zero the next day too as the rain keeps on. It's two days of stuffing our faces and lots of games and shenanigans. We have all been threatening to ice each other for a few weeks. I finally get a chance and there is nothing more glorifying. Happy Feet makes us a homemade lasagna dinner. Sunshine outdoes himself with fresh tiramisu.

I get to the road to hitch into Front Royal, it is twilight. Hard to hitch in the dark but within 15 minutes I get dropped off at Mom's Country Kitchen for second breakfast.<br><br>I resupply at the local market, make a sign to hitch back to the trail and soon I am walking again. That was easy. <br><br>Along the way I meet a few more Sobo's: Viewmaster, walking the Shenadoah section with her mom, then Doppler, who is doing the same with her partner Gumby.  While walking with Doppler and Gumby, the subject of beer comes up and soon after 2021 Nobo finisher Slim Shady recognizes us as Sobo hikertrash and offers us beer from his parked van.  As I write this post the day after,  I am sitting high up on the edge of a cliff thinking about beer.  Let's see what happens.<br><br>The storm that came through while I was  zeroing in Harper's Ferry caused a lot of trail debris and a few blowdowns.  Since Harper's Ferry, I am constantly flicking branches off the trail using my poles, occasionally stopping to pick up larger branches, throwing them off trail.  It is a good habit I picked up from Twig.  But, think about if all us thru-hikers started doing the same.  There is almost always someone a few hours ahead or behind. Except for big stuff, the trail would be quickly cleaned and stay that way till the next storm, unlike silk blazing where the spiders reset the trail daily. <br><br>And regarding the big stuff, the blowdowns, the overgrowth, the washouts: As Borderline (the 501 Shelter caretaker) noted, the biggest trail magic out here comes from the volunteers (and faeries) that build and maintain the trails and shelters.  Without them, the trails would be impassable.  No trail = no magic.<br><br>Camp tonight is in woods.<br><br>#atsobo<br>#atsobo2021<br>#phooning

In fact I can't tell much difference between South PA, MD, WV, or this named section of trail in VA.  Also, based on the height of the sign, I am fairly certain the "crew" are dwarves and the Trailboss is Snow White's trailname.<br><br>More importantly, this run of awesome shelters in these four states continues.

There were next to no climbs heading into town, but we did have some nice views.  I started to chafe  really badly with the heat and humidity the past few days. I‚Äôll need to go into town and work on some treatment.  When we got to the bottom of the mountain, we had a mile and a half of flat walking around some cornfields.  This section had the worst mosquitos we‚Äôve seen on trail.  I was killing about 20 a minute as they landed on me.  We finally made it to the road and got a ride into town where we‚Äôre going to sleep for the night and head back out tomorrow. <br><br>Day 71 ‚ÄúChafing Zero #2‚Äù<br>Miles - 0<br>MM - 669.2<br><br>After spending the evening taking care of my chafing issues (still have big thighs homies), I decided it would be best to rest and heal another day. We had breakfast with Hot Sauce, his mom, and aunt and said farewell to him as he heads south to finish his flip flop hike. We‚Äôve been rocking together since Andover, Maine and it has been a blast. I ran some errands after walk and easy left for the trail. I exchanged my darn tough socks at a shoe store in town, and got a few things from Walgreens that should help my chafing. Most of all, I‚Äôm now carrying some baby wipes to get the salt off of my skin at night.  I then set out on my adventure to catch the bus in town and head to the outlet mall to get some new compression shorts. After missing 2 busses (and wasting a few hours) I got on a bus and went up to the outlets. I got new compressions that are two sizes smaller than what I had on, so hopefully that helps too.  I resupplied at the grocery store, took the bus back to the hotel and relaxed the rest of the night. <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>#appalachaintrail #atsobo #thruhike #appalachaintrail2021 #atsobo2021 #thruhike2021 #mainetogeorgia #atclassof2021

One week ago, we were at our lowest ebb. I was struggling with an infected wound on my shoulder causing all sorts of knock-on effects on my posture with a bag that wasn't providing the support I needed. Our collective faith in the purpose of this journey was very much tested by this alongside the constant barrage of heat and humidity, swarms of mosquitos, and God-awful terrain. It's fair to say that our introspective moments mostly involved staring into a spiralling abyss of self-doubt. Fast forward a week and papa's got a brand new bag & we're skipping along the trail singing John Denver's ode to West Virginia (that's actually mostly about plain old Virginia). <br><br>Shaking up the routine to break the mental tedium has very much been a tried and trusted technique for each of us. Change of mileage; change of direction; changes of scenery. These can all lead to positive perspective changes and a newfound sense of purpose. All interspersed with doctor's orders amounts of rest and good dollops of home comforts üç¶üç∑ü•ë<br><br>Over three days, we covered the 50-odd miles from Harpers Ferry, WV to Front Royal, VA on the doorstep of our beloved Shenandoah. We were helped out by generous family (shoutout to Doolittle's folks & aunt Peggy & uncle Bill!) in the area to slackpack this section, which involved the notorious 13.5 mile stretch called the Roller-coaster. Apparently, this section of trail previously involved a ten-mile road walk, so even though there are some pretty tedious, rocky ups and downs, it's better than yellow blazing and nothing that any SOBO hiker hasn't done dozens of times thru New England. Any minor inconvenience is negated by the absolutely delightfully cruisey, smooth trail over the rolling NoVA hills. We were able to stop and smell the paw paw, which gives the woods an aroma of a bottle of red natty wine, appreciate the wildlife (a funky orb weaver spider as we head into October's spooky spider season üï∏Ô∏è) while cranking out 20+ miles in just over 7hrs. SOBOs behind us - this may be the promised land! ‚Äì The Diplomat <br><br>#atclassof2021 #atsobo2021 #virginiaisforlovers

We didn‚Äôt realize it until about 8 AM that the Cheshire post office closed at 11:30 that morning. We ate breakfast quickly and started out quickly down the mountain.  We pretty much ran downhill the entire way and made it into town around 11.  Amy was coming up so we hung out in Cheshire until she came and got us. We got into the motel and grabbed showers. We had a late Applebee‚Äôs lunch and tailgated outside the motel for the Penn State game against Auburn. We played Uno and watched the game until we went to bed.

We had a drawn out climb to start the day and after, it was an easy flowing day with easy ups and downs and flat sections throughout. When we got to Dalton on trail, we stopped at a sub shop to waste some time.  The subs were massive and I packed the second half out for dinner.  The shelter we planned on staying at was only 3 miles out of town, so despite our best efforts to waste time, we got to the shelter around 2:30. We ate and played crazy 8s for a while before turning in early.

Almost immediately we were ankle deep in mud and water.  We stopped at an older shelter for lunch where I ate my leftover chili‚Äôs. Much of my afternoon was spent listening to some audiobooks and trampling through the mud before getting into camp.  The mud in Vermont has made even easy terrain feel very difficult. We are all happy to be leaving tomorrow. We stayed in a small shelter with a couple and enjoyed a warmer evening. <br><br>Day 64 ‚ÄúMassachusetts‚Äù<br>Miles - 13.2<br>MM - 590.7 to 603.9<br><br>We stayed in camp later than usual talking with the couple we shared the shelter with the night before. Quickly after leaving we hit the Massachusetts/Vermont border, and the trail changed significantly. There is still mud, but certainly not to the ridiculous extent that Vermont had. We stopped at the grocery store in North Adams to get lunch before starting our climb up Mt. Greylock. This is our last 2500 ft. climb before we get to southern Virginia, so we took it nice and easy.  The first peak we hit had decent views, but after, we were in the clouds for the remainder of the climb.  We also hit 600 miles on trail at the first peak. It‚Äôs weird, I still don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôve done anything at this point and the enormity of 600 miles hasn‚Äôt sunk in. When we got to the top, the boys decided to stay at the lodge on top and we settled in for a night inside.  We are heading into Dalton tomorrow for a day off.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>#appalachaintrail #atsobo #thruhike #appalachaintrail2021 #atsobo2021 #thruhike2021 #mainetogeorgia #atclassof2021

Pen Mar Park is 21mi ahead with a large pavilion that has great sunset views where one can cowboy camp in... and order pizza. I am running low on food. <br><br>On the way to Pen Mar is the border with Maryland, the Mason-Dixon line and apparently I am angry when I take the selfie.  Arriving at Pen Mar before 5pm, there is a big shin dig complete with a vendor selling tenderloin sandwiches.  No need to wait for pizza, I order three. <br><br>Since the park is busy, we move on to the next shelter 5+ mi away.  High Rock Ledges is along the way off a short blue blaze trail.  One can drive to the ledges and it is a popular hangout / party spot.  And like many easily accessible natural places in this area, it has been violated: Covered in layers of spray painted profane graffiti, the ledges are packed, The lot  full of cars, two parked relatively close blasting two very different types of music. Beer bottles clanking as they are thrown into a pile after being chugged. Time to move on.<br><br>Its getting dark when we get to the Raven Rock shelter.  I assess the lone occupant and rate the snore potential as "very high" and go off to set up my tent among other tenters and hammockers including fellow Sobo Birdfeed. Twig rolls the dice and stays in the shelter. <br><br>#atsobo <br>#atsobo2021

But mornings with everyone piling into the shelter to eat are always entertaining. We slowly, one by one hit the trail and have a nice drizzly walk. Lots of climbing today and a few views when we pop out on the road. It's hawk migration season and we run into a huge group of bird watchers. Apparently it's too foggy today to see too many, but the day before there were hundreds swarming this area. I get a bottle of water from one of the bird watchers and we road walk for a bit to take on the views and avoid all the stupid and pointless ups and downs of the trail. It's another night in a shelter where we meet up with a couple more hikers who are SOBO flip floppers. The rain threatens, but stays away and we read signs in the shelter about the hornets who are apparently attracted to white headlamp light. Might be an interesting night. <br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #backpackvirginia #zebratales

There's nowhere to get breakfast in town so we hang around the shelter chugging all the coffee and piling all the donuts we can in. We finally pull ourselves away from our new home and hitch back to trail being serenaded with Mexican polka music the whole way. We have a big climb to start the day as we always do out of town and my clean smelling clothes are drenched in sweat in no time. The terrain reminds me of back home. We are in a super dry section and I am quite dehydrated by the end of the day. But we stop to see a sweet sunset before heading to find water and camp for the night anyways. Eating by headlamp again. Leftover pizza for dinner. Rain drizzle starts sometime in the night and a bat wakes us when it gets stuck in our shelter and keeps flying into walls. <br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #backpackvirginia #zebratales

I have 11 miles to go and then have to hitch into town to get to the post office before it closes at 10:30 AM. 10:30, yes that seems a good time to close for the day right ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I forgot how much I love hiking before the sun comes up. And watching the sun come up while walking. Being above the clouds. I stop so many times to take in the morning views and then it takes a while to get a ride into town, hitching from a fast-moving road. But a van-lifer picks me up and I get to the post office just in time. Thanks to my Dad for shipping my stove and some new shoe insoles out to me. Now that it's starting to get cold and after watching all the guys cook every day, I decided cold-soaking season was over. I also got a loaner tent as I am shipping mine back to @zpacks to get the zipper repaired. Love great gear companies! There's a free shelter in town and I lounge around and take the best hot, outdoor shower of my life. When the boys finally roll in, we hit up the only restaurant in town and stuff ourselves and spend the afternoon playing cards and doing all the town chores. I love tiny towns where everything is within walking distance. We contemplate all the ways we are going to start up businesses and take over the town. We settle on an undercover hiker bar since the town has none. S'mores and a fire to cap out the night and a warm night in the shelter all to ourselves. <br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #backpackvirginia #zebratales

All in all 53.6 miles in one day, with full gear. Oh and I even got to use an electric bike to finally get my official AT tag. Georgia here I come. So something great today.

Other highlights included free camping at a drive-in movie theater and crossing Bear Mountain bridge. We also had our first day of 'slack packing' thanks to Dolittle's sibling. This is when you get to leave your pack and do the miles with a light day pack - we got dropped at one trailhead and picked up down the trail later that day, and got a shower and bed after! We never took advantage of slacking opportunies in other states but really keen to do more üòä<br><br>With the good comes the bad, with the ups come the down. We had a tough week for a few other reasons which has led to us needing to take time off trail (will detail in another post) which was exacerbated by relentless heat and humidity and an unseasonal explosion of mosquitos because of all the recent rain then heat. Add to this some very poor trail management in the state - no wild camping allowed and shelters/designated campsites were long distances apart making planning difficult. Also huge distances without water and multiple shelters/camps with no water access.<br><br>The fall colours are started to arrive, the weather should start to get cooler soon and we're looking forward to getting SOUTH! - Dolittle<br><br>#atclassof2021 #atsobo2021 #veganthruhiker

It was a super easy day hiking, elevation wise, but the mud made it much harder. The mud in Vermont is pretty incredible and is constant.  You walk through ankle deep mud pretty much all day every day. We got to camp and washed off a bit before going to sleep early in the shelter at Stratton Pond. We hit the quarter mark on the trail. It‚Äôs a weird feeling, we‚Äôve walked so many miles and still feel like we‚Äôve done nothing.  That may change as we work south and start to knock out states more quickly.

The climb was a smooth and easy 1500 feet. The remainder of the day was a series of up and downs through mud and rocks before culminating in a climb up Glastenbury Mountain.  I redlined too quickly at the start of the mountain and the climb took longer than expected.  After, I ran downhill into camp for the night.  The shelter was full of folks on the Long Trail, so I set up my tent quickly and ate.  My new shoes ripped the skin off the back of my left ankle, so I‚Äôll have some stuff to figure out when we go into Bennington tomorrow.  I got an awful night of sleep on the sloped hill that my tent was pitched on and it rained a good bit of the night, soaking everything.

I was happy we were heading into town to dry off. We got down the mountain and had to wait a bit to get a ride, so we hung out and dried our gear out from the night before. We went into town, resupplied and enjoyed some town food. <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>#appalachaintrail #atsobo #thruhike #appalachaintrail2021 #atsobo2021 #thruhike2021 #mainetogeorgia

It's a new log book so we are the first sinners. The mist creeps in and we throw our stuff into the shelter right as the downpour starts. We collect rain water off the roof. The last couple lost boys roll in soaked in the dark. The shelter is a mess of food and wet gear. We hang our clothes to dry knowing they will still be wet in the morning.

The best Chinese buffet I have ever had. And the best deal for $10. The rest of the day is naps, beers, and cards. We finally pull ourselves away from the hostel to resupply at the dollar store and each grab our own Little Caesar's pizza or two. Been at least 10 years since I've had one. Either my hiker hunger is in full force or they have upped their pizza game. The next day we make pancakes from food we find in the hiker box. We wander around all the stores we can to buy all the food we don't need. But a hiker can never have too much crappy food. We play cards and day drink and finally pull ourselves away from the hostel to do a few trail miles. We find a sweet shelter and it's more cards and sugar until bed.

I am so so happy.  The Kind of Outdoorsy hostel in Duncannon has Darn Tough sock exchange.  This afternoon I will be walking on the clouds that are new socks. <br><br>But first I need to get there.  The trail stays fairly high on a ridge until the final miles into Duncannan where it drops sharply before crossing the Susquehanna River just before Duncannon. <br><br>Near Peter's Mountain Rd, just across the hiker pedestrian bridge, is a cooler with Trail Magic from Heartstrings.  Twig, Picky and I met Heartstrings south of Great Barrington in Mass., eating lunch with her at a shelter.  I leave a note for her, drink a Pepsi and fill up my water bottle.  Thanks Heartstrings!<br><br>On to Duncannon where Christmas is waiting.  The cork handles on my Black Diamond trekking poles started falling off while on the AT.  I contacted BD and they sent me new upper pole sections at no cost.  Thanks Black Diamond! Great trekking poles and better customer service! <br><br>In additon to poles, I have new earbuds, a new hat, and new socks.  Thank you Darn Tough.  I won't wear any other socks. <br><br>Just a note, my two pair of Darn Tough socks were far from new when I started the AT.  I wore one pair on the GET and hundreds of CO and UT miles prior to starting the AT.  It is fitting this pair succumbed to the trail in the 802 while sloshing through Vermud, where Darn Toughs are made. <br><br>#atsobo <br>#atsobo2021<br>#blackdiamond<br>#blackdiamondequipment<br>#darntough <br>#darntoughsocks

Thats a few miles shorter than planned.....but pizza. But shower. Target changed I slow the pace.  Along the way I stop at Hertline Campsite and Creek, walking a blue blaze to a concrete dammed  blue water pond with a rope swing.  Had to try that. But first lunch.  Dont worry Mom, I waited an hour before swimming.<br><br>The 501 Shelter is crowded by SOBO standards: 7 hikers.  4 Sobo's, 2 Nobo's, and one section hiker.  Pizza and milkshakes are consumed and leftovers saved for breakfast. <br><br>I leave the 501 around 0715 in a hurry and I dont know why. Duncannon is 47mi away and I will be there in 2 days whether I hurry or not.  Need to slow down a bit. <br><br>Early in the walk I check Guthooks and confirm I was still in PA. Where did the rocks go?  3mi in I cross the 1000mi mark.  Only 1193 to go. <br><br>13mi in I meet Jinx who is giving us Sobo's some Trail Magic love including root beer floats!, fruit, watermelon, brownies.... The root beer float was so unexpected on the trail and so good. We talk for about 45min and then I leave again in a hurry.  And I don't know why.  Duncannon is only 34mi away. <br><br>I walk another 18 and set my tent up high on a ridge in a stand of pines with a beautiful soft pine duff floor.  Pine duff: the Posturpedic of tentsites. The breeze keeps the temps cool, the mozzies hiding and  the duff made the sleep quality high. <br><br>I did see my first tick today, a Lone Star. It was crawling on my pack.  Instead of Lyme, or a red meat allergy, wouldn't be cool if a tick bite could cure stuff.  Maybe my lactose intolerance so I could participate in the half-gallon ice cream challenge coming up at the Pine Grove Furnace Gen. Store in a few days.<br><br>#atsobo2021 <br>#atsobo

Ate pizza delivered to the 501 shelter and cooled off with a cold shower. The trail provides, albeit in odd ways sometimes. #atsobo2021

The rest of CT was mostly alright with some cool views of falls along the Housatonic River, which the trail mostly follows, and we got to see a covered bridge, which I'm weirdly obsessed with. I got some wicked bad shoulder chafe that turned my shoulder black, but a weekend of showering and not lugging my tortoise shell around has improved the situation greatly. Hiking with pals and hitting up little hiker friendly country stores for brewskis ensured a lorra lorra laughs. <br><br>And just like that, we bid adieu to New England.

Road walking proves much harder than the trail, but it's worth it. The AT used to run where the Skyline Rd. runs through the whole park until it became a National Park. Apparently we haven't bought enough honey buns to afford the good views. We find a stealth spot and of course spend dinner talking about food. It's our favorite topic of convo. We're neroing into town tomorrow for our first shower in 10 days. Probably needed. <br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #backpackvirginia #zebratales

Hike hard and fast in the morning. Make it to a wayside for lunch. Stay as long as possible. Hike hard and fast to camp for the night. Eat as many honey buns as possible. Drink all the beers. We find a lodge in the evening. A friend of one of our group brings us trail magic. We devour food. We still order pizza too. We run into the "last NOBO". He's drunker than drunk. No wonder he's last. We freeze in the ridgetop wind, our bodies unable to handle cold when they're not moving. We find live music and the best people watching. We almost get away with the best stealth spot ever, but instead end up sprinting away in hysterical laughter after almost getting caught. We find a better and slightly more legal stealth spot and sleep great. We splurge for lodge breakfast. We laugh at how small normal food portions are. We pet horses. We see endless number of deer that are not the least bit scared of us. We watch a gorgeous sunset and serenade day hikers with T. Swift. I don't know if we could have any more fun. We find a shelter just at dark and eat by headlamp and risk the shelter mice for a chance to not set our tents up. <br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #backpackvirginia #zebratales

Had a fast morning walk into town where we stopped at a hostel to do laundry, raid their hiker box, and load up on pizza and ice cream. Back on the trail in the afternoon for a climb into the Shenandoah Mountains. Had an unexpected sprinkle and then got hit with another insane downpour right when we got to camp. Finally getting back up in elevation and it definitely feels colder. Next day we hit our first wayside. Now that we are walking through a touristy national park we hit a wayside (small convenience store) basically every day. Hiker heaven. So much food. Hunger pains go away finally. It's windy. We're walking on ridges. We have views. I buy cards and we play at our shelter before bed. Two more of our SOBO friends catch us. We're back to a group of six.

My shoes were wearing down and my left ankle has been very sore for the last few days. We did 14ish miles out of town to the Stony Brook Shelter. These miles haven‚Äôt been coming super easily, as the trail has gotten easier it‚Äôs still very up and down and the mud is brutal.  The following day we hiked a hard day to the top of Killington Mountain. We stayed in the worst shelter we‚Äôve stayed in at Cooper Lodge. It poured rain and just about every spot on the roof leaked. We laid out some tarps and had a restless night of sleep. The next day we walked about 11 miles and stayed in Rutland, VT to dry all of our gear (especially the sleeping bags) out. As my ankle deteriorated, I had to get new shoes the next day. Luckily, Rutland had a nice shoe store and I switched to Hokas from my Altras. They gave me a lot more cushion and my ankle immediately felt better hiking. Walk and I did about 12 miles out of town after noon that day.  We stayed in a beautiful shelter called Little Rock Pond Shelter.  It was cold that night, but awesome.  We walked a long, almost 18 mile day yesterday to set up an easy hike into Manchester Center.  The mud and puds (pointless ups and downs) have been draining in Vermont.  For much of this section the trail has been extremely muddy. They‚Äôve gotten over 15 inches of rain since the beginning of July in Vermont. It has been similar to hiking in sand as you can‚Äôt get traction on anything.  We made it into town and got some much needed showers. My ankle is healing up nicely in newer shoes, it appears as though I waited too long to replace shoes with worn out midsoles; won‚Äôt be making that mistake again.  Only 56 miles left in Vermont and we all can‚Äôt wait to hit the Mass border to get away from this mud. For the next few days, we are mud people. <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>#appalachaintrail #atsobo #thruhike #appalachaintrail2021 #atsobo2021 #thruhike2021 #mainetogeorgia

The hills weren‚Äôt big or long, but it was up and down all day. The one beautiful part of Vermont is that the trail no longer goes straight up hills, instead it kind of wraps around the hill going to the top. Also, the huge rocks all but disappeared. We were up and down from road crossings until we met Amy on the other side of our last mountain. She and Walk rented an AirBnB for Sunday and Monday and we will be zeroing.  We had an awesome dinner of burgers and hotdogs cooked by Hot Sauce and Easy. We watched Joe Dirt and crashed for the night. A few of these pictures are from the following days as well. Vermont has started to run together. <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>#appalachaintrail #atsobo #thruhike #appalachaintrail2021 #atsobo2021 #thruhike2021 #mainetogeorgia

I should have raided the hostel hiker box as soon as I got to town.  At least I raided it before leaving.<br><br>On trail at 1030 I am immediately immersed in the trail rocks of Rocksylvania.  Small to medium rocks litter the trail requiring 100% concentration to keep from stubbing, twisting, wedging....and a myriad of other 'ings to your feet, ankles and shoes .  The large rocks I can hop, jump and skip over.  But not these.  Also ratlesnakes.  Twig camped next to a small timber rattler two nights ago and now I am a bit more vigilant.<br><br>GBITs pulls through and I end my day at Leroy A Smith shelter with dry feet and no mosquitoes.  This walking all day with dry feet may be a first on this trail.<br><br>At the shelter I meet the last NOBO.  Late Night started at Springer 46 days ago so he may have a chance to make it to Baxter before it closes, 15 OCT. The feat is impressive if he pulls it off but at what cost.  I like my town time and hanging with other hikers more than I like just cranking out miles.<br><br>Late Night wakes at 0330 and starts packing.  I sleep in and leave at my usual time: 0600.  The goal today is 31.5mi including a stop at the Thunderhead Lodge for dinner and then a 1.7mi walk to camp. <br><br>Along the way I meet Soma.  This guy made the Lite AF fanny pack I am wearing.  We sit and talk while I eat lunch. Soma is an excellent ambassador for a great company.  Glad we crossed paths. <br><br>Later I eat at the Thunderhead Lodge.  The waitstaff was accommodating and sit me next to an outlet for charging my electronics.  The food was great, the local Hawk coffee stout even better, and the bartender fun to talk to. Highly recommended.  I make it to camp and finish setting up using my headlamp. Goals met.<br><br>#atsobo<br>#atsobo2021<br>#liteaf <br>#thunderheadlodge

We hit it super lucky and had already planned to stay at Bascom Lodge on the top of the mountain that first evening as a treat (ahem, and much needed shower!).

The trail was of course awful for days after (see prev video!).<br><br>But besides the terrain, MA was magical. Beautiful views, fields and bucolic scenes. The trail actually intersects a few small towns and we had the joy of meeting the lovely Tom, whose house is in Dalton along the AT. He has been a trail angel for 40 years, allowing hikers to camp in his backyard. He even made us a cup of coffee in the morning!<br><br>We stumbled upon a farm stand along the trail with a fridge in it filled with cold drinks and snacks with a list of prices, honor system style.<br><br>We're feeling strong now - definitely have 'trail legs' and the motions of hiking are becoming robot-like, in a good way. Its a huge mental boost as well to be on this section of the trail with fellow SOBO friends we have made.

Crossed the I80 bridge, 3rd time on a long trail I've come to this interstate. Once it was near Donner pass CA, another time at Rawlins WY. Now here at the Delaware Water Gap. Goodby NJ, it was truly a pleasure. The rocks await. Some other milestones. It had been 17 days and 5 states (Vermont) since I last machine washed my clothes and 9 days and 3 states since a hot shower. DWG provided a much needed break. Let's rumble PA. #atsobo2021

Its been fun but the run is almost over.  The Sandwich Lobby outside Branchville, NJ is the last stop. <br><br>A storm is coming - its the AT, a storm is always coming - and maybe I can make the AMC Mohican Center, 26mi ahead, before it breaks and hide in a bunk room. The trail is cruisier in this section and I make it before 4pm.  The caretaker at the AMC is experimenting on new sandwich recipes and tries one out on me for free! I must have bought the deli-run bonus pack.<br><br>The storm is delayed so I continue on and will take my chances on the ridge into Delaware Water Gap.  It hits around 8, high winds, thunder and lightning, and lots of rain.  But I am dry and warm with only a few thousands of an inch of DCF fabric between me and the elements. <br><br>In the morning I pack my wet tent and walk the 8mi to town and my next state, hoping the mosquitoes are stopped at the border.  I am looking forward to a nero and all the food, including dinner at Sango Kura, PA's only sake brewery.  But chores first, it has been 15 days and 7 states since my clothes have seen a real washing machine. <br><br>#atsobo<br>#atsobo2021>

After a breakfast of pancakes, bacon, and eggs we hit the road. Stopped by the ATC again to get all our halfway pics taken and be official SOBOs. Had a warm, but enjoyable day cruising first through West Virginia and then into Virginia. Some hikers do the 4 State Challenge which is where you walk 42 miles to hit 4 different states in one day. We were pretty proud that it took us 4 days to complete. Started the roller coaster of Virginia, which proved to be much easier than all the NOBOs told us it would be as it always is. Found a sweet spot to camp and watched an epic sunset. Watched shooting stars and finally had an epically clear night sky to stargaze. The guys started their self-inflicted pushup challenge, because thru hiking isn't hard enough. The next day was more roller coaster action, getting stung by a bee while admiring the 1000 miles to Springer Mountain sign. Ate a papa for the first time, some neat fruit that grows out here and found some pretty fields to walk through. <br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #backpackwestvirginia #backpackvirginia #zebratales

After we bought our Amtrak tickets the train ended up being 4 hours delayed so we got a shuttle instead. Riding in a Tesla was way more fun anyways. Walked around all the monuments and statues, did all the people watching, ate oysters on the wharf and found a fun dive bar. Almost lost my 3rd phone of the trail after leaving it on the metro, but lucked out after a very nice human found it. Of course we were already back at the hostel by that point. So back to DC I went the next day to retrieve the phone. And then we spent the rest of the day walking around Harpers Ferry and eating and trying to be as hikertrashy as possible. We checked out the ATC to get our halfway pics taken, but of course they were closed. Ended the night with a real meal that the hostel workers made for us. BBQ chicken never tasted so good. Learned a super fun new card game called Yuker and finally enjoyed a little time off our feet. A great couple zero days, despite walking an insane amount of miles for "rest days".<br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #zebratales

Got a hitch into town to resupply on a crazy busy highway which is always a fun challenge! Went to a Sheetz for the first time. The west coast really needs to get on this chain trend. Had another hitch out of town with the cutest dog. Night hikes over some crazy rocky terrain and found the mass of labor day weekend warriors. Eating dinner by headlamp is the new norm now. Had a hot day the next day walking into Harpers Ferry, but got to see a bunch of cool historical spots. And all the day hikers. Found a fun hostel to stay at, played endless massive jenga games, drank beers and only had to wait 3 hours for our pizza delivery. <br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #backpackmaryland #zebratales

It seems like half of NYC is here and all of them purposely grilling or barbecuing so that the delicious scents waft directly over us as we pass through.  My hiker hunger has reached ludicrous speed. <br><br>Bear Mtn rises 1120 feet above the park and includes 1310 steps over 1.7mi.  As we begin the climb Twig looks back, grins, and says "Grand Canyon" and takes off.  On the AZT, we raced up the S. Kaibab trail, making the 7mi, 5500 ascent with packs in just over 2.5hrs.  This was nothing. <br><br>Camp tonight is by a creek a few miles west of Bear Mtn. I bathe and do laundry, washing off the race day sweat then settle in for good nights sleep, serenaded by a million tree frogs. Around 1130 the beat starts hammering. Its a pop-up rave, booming reggaeton from some nearby parking area and the volume is set to 11.  F.  It does not stop until after 0430.  Hope their hearing loss matches my sleep loss.<br><br>We all leave camp at different times, walking in a sleep deprived funk.  The consistent rhythm of foot on trail helps reduce my pissitivity.  A bath in a waterfall just before camp washes it away.  Camp tonight is at Wildcat shelter with 4 other Sobo's. - it's a bubble  Twig, Picky and I opt to tent to hide from mozzies, but the rest stay in the shelter.

Buildings crumble, monuments decay, and wealth vanishes, but Katahdin in all its glory forever shall remain the mountain of the people of Maine."&nbsp; Here is my tribute to all those who have conquered Katahdin as part of their personal journey.&nbsp;<br><br>Northern Terminus of the Appalachian Trail, acrylic on canvas board, painted by Slowfoot, Appalachian Trail Thru Hiker & Maintainer<br><br>Available at&nbsp;MountainBlaze.Etsy.com&nbsp;<br><br>@fuckingreasy<br>@dirty.bubble.watch <br>#appalachianthruhike2021 #atsobo #atsobo2021 #atnobo2021 #atnobo <br>#appalachiantrail2021 #appalachiantrail #appalachiantrailthruhike #katahdin #baxterstatepark <br>@baxterpark #northernterminusoftheappalachiantrail #alpinesummit #hikertrash2021 #hikertrash @appalachianlongdistancehikers #traildays #attraildays @mountainblazearts #mtkatahdin #mountkatahdin #sunriseonkatahdin #knifeedgetrail #katahdinknifesedge #katahdinsummit #katahdinmaine #handpainted #handpaintedart #katahdinstream

The end of New Hampshire actually had a small mountain with switchbacks, it was a refreshing change. The trail walks right behind the athletic fields at Dartmouth and through the town of Hanover. We made it into town quickly and went straight to Ramuntos for our free slices of pizza for thru hikers and ate up before heading over to our hotel via the local bus line. Easy met us in town with an electric bike he was riding around town advertising for all of the students on campus. We got to our hotel which was way too nice for 4 dirty hikers to be staying in.  I went over to Walmart in the evening and sat outside doing my fantasy draft after resupplying food for the next few days. We had a late night and a planned late start the next day. <br><br>Day 51 ‚ÄúVermont‚Äù<br>Miles - 8.5<br>MM - 442.1 to 450.6<br><br>We got up and had breakfast at the hotel. While I was arranging a ride, Mock (@iannolon), who we met early on in Maine, messaged me to see where we were. He lives in Norwhich, VT which was right across the NH/VT border and offered to give us a ride and walk with us for a bit. We happily accepted and he came and got us at the hotel around 11.  Once we got back downtown in Hanover, we stopped for our free donuts from Lou‚Äôs and made our way on the road walk. The border of NH and VT was on a bridge over the Connecticut River and we stopped for some pictures before moving along. Mock showed us around his hometown, or at least what touches the AT. After the road walk, he headed out and we pressed on our short day to camp.  The trail was very different in this section, with very few rocks and gradual inclines.  We made camp around 4ish and Easy got a fire rolling.  We relaxed and hung out while eating dinner and went to bed early. <br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>#appalachaintrail #atsobo #thruhike #appalachaintrail2021 #atsobo2021 #thruhike2021 #mainetogeorgia

We ate breakfast and two more SOBOs joined us - Trash Panda and Flow. After breakfast we set out to tackle our last mountain in the Whites - Mt. Mist.  A little bit through the climb we hit 400 miles and as we went up and over, we exited the White Mountains. It was another accomplishment along the path. We climbed up Mt. Cube and stayed in the Hexacuba Shelter which was unique in that it was shaped like a hexagon.  The sunset was pretty and it rained pretty much all night, but we were warm and dry in the shelter. <br><br>Day 49 ‚ÄúClearing after the Storm‚Äù<br>Miles - 17.7<br>MM - 413.5 to 431.2<br><br>Around 6 AM, the rain stopped and we started getting up and ready a little later. It was a soggy morning, but it cleared and we didn‚Äôt get any more rain. We had a long climb up to the top of Smarts Mountain, but it was pretty gradual and we cruised up.  At the top, there was a fire tower we went up and grabbed some pictures and views.  We had a couple more climbs on the day that were similar in that they were long, but not terribly steep. It cleared up throughout the day and we had some really pretty views on some cliffs and rock balds.  We stayed in the Moose Mountain Shelter about 10 miles from Hanover and are ready to put a bow on NH tomorrow. <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>#appalachaintrail #atsobo #thruhike #appalachaintrail2021 #atsobo2021 #thruhike2021 #mainetogeorgia

Almost everyone us told us the 200 miles from Moosilauke north were the toughest, so we were pretty jacked up to get rolling on the day.  The climb up Moosilauke was steep at the beginning, but had steps most of the way up which made it much easier.  Once we hit the campsite about half way up, it evened out pretty nicely and coasted to the top. I felt good going into it and thought it was one of the easier 3k foot climbs in the Whites.  We took some pictures at the top and headed down to camp at Jeffers Brook, just on the other side of the mountain. Just like that our last mountain over 4K until the South is done, and we‚Äôre looking forward to picking up the pace going forward.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>#appalachaintrail #atsobo #thruhike #appalachaintrail2021 #atsobo2021 #thruhike2021 #mainetogeorgia

Park Ranger Too Late decided he‚Äôd wait for us to catch up so our group is back to 5. The climb up the Kinsmans was fairly gradual southbound, but slow. We hit our last hut on trail for an awesome oatmeal bar thing and some water and rolled out. It started raining on us shortly after we started up and we didn‚Äôt have much for views on top. The way down was steep for a short period. It kind of reminded me of Maine with some steep slabs of rock to traverse.  Once down, we had another mountain to tackle on the day which was an obnoxiously long up and down climb up to Mt. Wolf.  At the top, Walk and I got poured on until we made it just before the parking lot. We got through it and had over 11k feet of up and down on the day. For us, any day over 10k is pretty brutal. It was rough and slow due to the rain. We headed back to the Notch Hostel for our last night in town before wrapping up the Whites. <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #atsobo #thruhike #appalachaintrail2021 #atsobo2021 #thruhike2021 #mainetogeorgia #hikenewhampshire

Had a nice breakfast at the hut of oatmeal, eggs, and sausage. Talked with a few folks who were section hiking and northbound on the AT.  Tons of people were out doing the Pemi Loop and I spent most of breakfast talking with another hiker who hurt her ankle the day before and came into the hut late the night before. She got me thinking about tackling the 4ks in NH after this hike. After a bit too much talking and stalling on the hike, I headed out to get over Garfield, Lafayette, and down into Franconia Notch. It was cold. I sweated through my clothes by the time I made it halfway up Garfield and the wind was making it even colder.  I stopped at the shelter to warm up with some coffee and snacks as I didn‚Äôt plan on stopping for the remainder of the day. The top of Garfield was beautiful, but full of people, so I grabbed some pictures and moved on.  After a couple of miles I started the climb up Mt. Lafayette, our last 5000 ft peak until the South. Saw a bunch of NOBOs and false peaks up Lafayette. The north side of the mountain was all new to me, but I did hike the ridge last year. The views didn‚Äôt disappoint, but there were a ton of people up top and I took a few pictures and headed down to Mt. Lincoln and then down to Franconia Ridge.  It was a long descent, but I was at the Notch Hostel by 7 and settled in for the night and a day off tomorrow. <br><br>Day 45 ‚ÄúNotch Hostel Zero‚Äù<br>Miles - 0<br>MM - 374.2<br><br>We relaxed all day. The majority of the Whites were over and we were pretty worn out. We had some errands to get done in town. I was looking for more sturdy trekking poles and we all needed to resupply and get lunch. Lincoln didn‚Äôt have any trekking poles that were heavier than the Lekis I already have so I ordered some to Hanover. We resupplied and grabbed lunch at a Mexican restaurant in Lincoln. We watched a few movies and hung out at the hostel with some NOBOs. Back on trail tomorrow. <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #atsobo2021 #thruhike #appalachaintrail2021 #mainetogeorgia #hikenewhampshire #atsobo #thruhike2021

Waterproof phone case and all. Pennsylvania was a lot of rain, a lot of rocks, and a lot of bugs. And very pretty. The humidity and temperature were insane and made eating during the day pretty hard. I wandered around mapless for quite a few days and walked a few extra miles trying to find water in a pretty dry section. But the trail always provides. Met a lot of nice people and finally started running into more southbounders. Another hurricane hit and I spent half a day walking through a river of a trail and a downpour to make it to the coolest old mansion of a hostel. I holed up with a little crew and we read and played games with our headlamps after the power went out. Made it to the halfway point in the trail and we celebrated by hitching into town and ended the night with cornhole and beers. Finally tried Yuengling for the first time so I guess I am officially AT hikertrash now.<br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #backpackpennsylvania #zebratales

The goal is to get to Kent, CT before it starts to downpour. A drizzle then light rain starts in the first half of the walk and chases us most of the way into town. We complete the 14+ mi by 10 and Twig and Picky head for second breakfast while I go to the PO to collect my new shoes before joining them. <br><br>My shoes are destroyed, the red insoles visible through blown sidewall front and back. All sides, both shoes. <br><br>Kent is a cutish town but we kent afford to get a room there and hide from Ida.  We shuttle to New Milford and stay at a more affordable motel, do town chores and resupply for the next two days.  All the while the rain continues all day, sometimes intense, confirming our decision to duck it.<br><br>Few pics today,  but I got New Shoes!<br><br>#atsobo<br>#atsobo2021

Unfortunately, the end of VT did not warm our hearts like the first half did - we got caught in some crazy thunderstorms and found out the hard way why Vermont has the nickname VerMUD. We also were revisited by our ol' friends - rocks and roots - from NH/ME, hence the photo of Dolittle about to have a meltdown looking at the terrain ahead.<br><br>Even with the rain, mud and terrain, there were moments of beauty. Lakes and ponds, funky lichen and shrooms, beaver dams everywhere and misty mountain walks. We also shared 100 miles of the trail with hikers on Vermont's Long Trail, a 270 mile trail from the south to North of the state. It was fun meeting other hikers on a different journey!<br><br>We crossed into Massachusetts with our friend Stand Up and now are ready to crank up the miles!

The only caveat was that I couldn‚Äôt get to the trailhead until after 8:30. It was going to be hard to catch the guys with such a late start, but I‚Äôll try. I started out up the mountain and stopped at each water source along the way. I felt much better the more hydrated I was. After the initial climb, the trail was flat for about 5 miles which was a nice reprieve. At the end of the flat section I came across some cliffs near Zealand Mountain and they were gorgeous.  I got to the first hut and spent way too much time talking to a couple of NOBOs - Cowboy and Badger.  About an hour and a half later I left and started up Zealand Mountain.  After the initial incline, the uphills were fairly forgiving.  I spent much of the remainder of the day going up, culminating at the top of South Twin Mountain.  I think this was the prettiest view on the entire trail thus far, with what felt like all of the Whites in view. I spent too much time up top and decided to go into the hut that evening as I wouldn‚Äôt make the campsite before 9:30ish. I had a good dinner, rehydrated, and talked to a few hikers before bed. <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #atsobo #thruhike #appalachaintrail2021 #atsobo2021 #thruhike2021 #mainetogeorgia #hikenewhampshire

It was oatmeal, eggs, and sausage.  We all got moving around 8ish. The AT kind of wraps around many of the peaks in the Presidentials as opposed to going to the top, but we still do climb a fair amount on the way. We walked around Mt. Adams, Mt. Jefferson, and started up around Mt. Clay on the way to Mt. Washington.  The ground was almost all rocks and we were very fortunate to have such a nice day. It definitely was worth the few days off for this weather.  The humidity has been really high since we started in the Presidentials and the climbs have been killing me.  On our ascent up to Washington, the Cog Train that runs to the top goes right by the trail and those folks were all in for a treat watching me struggle to the top.  I figured they wouldn‚Äôt remember me anyway, but a lady came up to me when I was on top of Washington and said they all saw me working hard coming up the mountain.  We got some food at the concession stand at the top of the mountain and made our way back down.  Thankfully on the south side of the mountain the rocks subsided a bit.  We filled up our water at Lake of the Clouds and pressed on toward Mizpah Hut.  We passed Mt. Monroe and Mt. Eisenhower and didn‚Äôt take the side trips to the top. The hike was a slow, flat grind until Mt. Pierce which was on trail and a small climb and steep descent into camp. Once in camp, I set up to cowboy camp since it was clear and enjoyed a good nights rest after one of our harder days on trail.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #atsobo #thruhike #appalachaintrail2021 #atsobo2021 #thruhike2021 #mainetogeorgia #hikenewhampshire

Record rainfall in July and 2 tropical systems in a week left the trail a corridor of mud. Remember those nice clean shoes? They didn't last even a few minutes. When I did the Long Trail last year in late September and early October, I didn't get my feet muddy once! I missed that nice trail this year. But like everything else, I got through it and pretty fast. Vermont is in the books after 1 week. One casualty though, I broke a trekking pole when I slipped on a muddy wet bog log and went down hard on my butt. In all this time hiking, I've never broken a pole. First time for everything...this trail is hard on gear and my body. #atsobo2021 #purplerainskirts #purplerainadventureskirts

We started out with a nice few miles of hiking to the tentsite. After the tensite stuff got real. The climb up Madison was a steep almost 2900 feet of elevation gain over 2.5 miles. This took me a while and was probably the hardest climb we‚Äôve had to date. Katahdin was technically more difficult with tougher rock scrambles, but this was steeper than that hike.  Once we broke tree line we still had about 1000 feet to gain over some rocks.  I ended up taking a lot of breaks.  I had great views and at the peak it was pretty windy.  Once I got up to the top I decided that I would stay at the hut if they had space, which they did. The tentsite we were considering was another .6 miles downhill and although the hut was expensive, I wanted to be well recovered for tomorrow over Washington. We had a good dinner of bean enchiladas and enjoyed some good company and went to bed early. <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #atsobo #appalachaintrail2021 #atsobo2021 #thruhike #mainetogeorgia #thruhike2021 #hikenewhampshire

We had a bunch of hard climbs and a really hard descent into Pinkham Notch ahead.  The first climb was the toughest of the day and had some good scrambling and climbing as we got to the top.  We had a few smaller climbs and one awesome one that had great views of Mt. Washington before the clouds rolled in.  I got into Carter Notch Hut around noon and relaxed for a bit. It was extremely humid and I sweated a ton on the hike.  After the hut we had a difficult climb followed by the downhill. As I left the hut, the rain started to creep in. Once I got to the top of Wildcat mountain it was a full downpour and we descended the 6 miles into Pinkham Notch in the rain.  It was very difficult and I walked most of the way down with Layers as we were all going to the same place that night. Too Late got an AirBnB for us to stay in that night in Berlin.  Getting a ride there was a nightmare, but after a while we got a super expensive shuttle. We got to the house and it was great. Too Late made a taco casserole for dinner and we jammed to some tunes.  Layers got the guitar out and played a while, and we went to bed. <br><br>Days 36-39 ‚ÄúHenri Campout‚Äù<br>Miles - 0<br>MM - 319.4<br><br>Our timing for Mt. Washington couldn‚Äôt have been worse. We planned for a zero day after the Wildcats and needed it badly.  After we decided on that zero we realized the timing of getting over Mt. Washington would put us up top in the remnants of Tropical Storm Henri. The rain wasn‚Äôt a big deal but winds up top were expected to be pretty strong so we decided to camp out for a few days and make our run through the Whites after. The first day we stayed at the Barn at the Libby House. The next few we‚Äôre back at the Quality Inn. I got a great deal so we all piled in a hotel room and hung out. Movies, football, food, Uno, and lots of boredom ensued and we got ready to head back out on Tuesday. <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #atsobo #appalachaintrail2021 #atsobo2021 #thruhike #thruhike2021 #hikenewhampshire #mainetogeorgia

Temps shot back up today and boy was it warm. As I get closer to Pennsylvania, the trail gets rockier. I don't know how it can get any rockier, but somehow it does. Pennsylvania is also called Rocksylvania on the AT, so apparently it's going to get even worse. It was so hot that food sounded horrible. I had to force myself to eat throughout the day. I walked along the Delaware River and walked into Pennsylvania. Saw a bear, the third I've seen in trail. I get excited to see bears so I told a group of weekend warrior college kids in passing that I had just seen one and to be on the lookout. Bad idea. They were not so excited. I spent a little while reaffirming them that they would be fine and with as much noise as they were making he would probably be long gone by now. I've seen a bunch of smaller snakes, but finally saw a big one today. I thought it was a stick at first and almost kicked it out of the trail. Glad I didn't. Pushed my longest day yet and was glad to let me feet rest from rock stumbling when I finally stopped for the day. <br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #backpacknewyork #backpackpennsylvania #zebratales

I feel like I haven't been dreaming much recently, I think because I usually wake up so much throughout the night when I'm camping. It was the first time in awhile that I didn't wake before my alarm went off at 6:30. I definitely needed that sleep. Our wonderful pastor host made us pancakes and coffee and we had the most delightful morning with him and his family. Seriously the most comfortable, loving, and homey hostel experience I have had. Feeling very thankful. We set off on the trail and the post-hurricane weather was thankfully a little windier than normal which really helped cut down on the humidity. A pretty morning with flowers and butterflies and a rocky afternoon. Passed by a veterans memorial for the high point in New Jersey. Laughed at a ridiculously obvious privy sign. Walked hard after a late start and made it to camp round dusk. The camp had a wonderful spring with the coldest and most refreshing water!! Now the birds are going crazy as they seem to do most nights. I'm cold soaking some top ramen and rubbing my sore feet. <br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #backpacknewyork #zebratales

I finally took a day off. Or a zero as we call it in the thru-hiking community. I was waiting on a package in the mail and there was that hurricane going on apparently, so it seemed like a good enough reason to take a break. I had the best night's sleep I have had on the entire trail. I sat outside the country store and ate breakfast on the porch and watched the little town wake up. It was so relaxing. It really made me miss living in a small town. My entire goal for the day was to walk as little as possible and eat as much as possible. I read and stretched and did some yoga and picked up a package I had my mom sent out with a new shirt and sports bra since mine were starting to disintegrate. I couldn't bear to throw away my tshirt since it was the same one I wore on my first thru hike so I sent the holey, smelly thing home. Sorry mom. I tried to eat some vegetables along with as many calories as I could get, but my body just doesn't know what to do with excess calories anymore and stuffing my face proved harder than expected. A few other hikers showed up at the hostel and what do you know, three SOBOs!!! I haven't seen any in a while so it was a pleasant surprise. My feet were looking pretty puffy by the end of the day, they just don't even know what to do when they're not walking all day. But I crawled in the comfyest bed ever for one more night.<br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #backpacknewyork #zebratales

Griffin Lk to Bennington.<br><br>Henri has reinvigorated the Vermud.  I have read about it, listened to NOBO stories about it, and now I am in it.  Yea. <br><br>A few hours after waking at Griffin Lk I cross a dirt road and see a sign for trail magic. Yea!  Spineless Cougar (a section hiker) and friend have setup an incredibly thoughtful and detailed spread of food as well as hiker hygeine and first aid items.  They have done their homework.  I dive into all things fresh: grapes, carrots, bananas and finish with a donut and a replacement Ziplock.  Sated I hike on. <br><br>Henri is gone and I go.  I stop twice during the day to remove my shoes and rinse the Vermud out of my Altras. <br><br>Near the end of the day after summiting Stratton, I reach a tent area near the trailhead and camp with Handstand, Luke and Anna.  Anna is getting off the LT, tired of the green tunnel and the Vermud.  I get it.  She has two weeks and wants to have some views.  Me: I just like to walk, views are a bonus. <br><br>The next morning I come up on Heisenberg, a SOBO from Washington state, and he is moving.  Nice to have someone to walk and talk with while heading generally southin good time.  We get to the road and are shuttled into Bennington, do chores, and head to Madison's for a brew and dinner.  Afterwards I take a second shower.  Tomorrow morning I will take my 3rd.  Then, maybe then, I will have rinsed Hurricane Henri out of all my cracks and crevices.<br><br>#atsobo<br>#atsobo2021

They drop me off at the trail before 3pm where I try to get Will to carry my pack for me to Ga.  Always great to see them.<br><br>Its starts to rain 20 minutes into walk - Henri is coming.  I make it to Governor Clement shelter before the winds hit hard, packed in tight with 6 other hikers. <br><br>Sometime in the night the rain stops and I leave the shelter in the morning with the umbrella stowed.  Parts of the trail look magical as the rain soaked moss lining the path is an almost a florescent green in the cloud filtered light.  It would be beautiful if the path was not oozing the dreaded Vermud.  The shoe sucking muck covers most of the boggier trail sections and slows progress.<br><br>Along the way I pass several stiles that go over non-existing fences. Without a fence to cross is it still a stile? Or just a PUD? I recognize this area from the Long Trail last year and anticipate the apple trees ahead bit its a little early in the year and apples are not close to ripe. <br><br>It has rained most of the day and I am sure the Griffin Lake Shelter will be packed so I setup in the rain on a tent platform 0.4mi before the shelter.  I drift off thinking this is so much better than being sardined in a shelter on a rainy night. <br><br>#atsobo<br>#atsobo2021

Not at all because I took refuge in the most awesome ski hut and got to watch the storm on top a mountain, staying nice and dry. Second tropical system since I walked into Vermont and in less than a week. The first was actually a lot worse, with heavy rain for 24 hours. This one, I barely got wet, but I also planned it better by pushing to get to the hut and an easy nero into Manchester Center the next morning. I'm tired of the weather dictating my schedule so look forward to just getting back to the trail to WALK as long as I want to each day. Hopefully Greylock summit for a B-day celebration in a few days. It's been a rather wild ride this time Vermont and I think I need a break from you. #atsobo2021 #purplerainskirts

For New England, we're getting a lot of Old England vibes; pastoral scenes, wildflower fields, red barns and proper English countryside style with stiles.<br><br>The actual trail hiking has been a lot easier with us able to bust out 45 miles in 2.5 days, which is wild in comparison to Maine & New Hampshire. However, the weather has proved to be our biggest enemy. In these lower lands we're tackling some horrific humidity causing us to sweat from every single pore by 9am every day into clothes that haven't dried from the previous day's sweat fest. I really can't express how soul crushing it can be to peel on sweaty underwear in the morning; this is how hiker stank is born üò∑We've also been forced to get a shuffle on & take unplanned zeros with the battering of the Eastern seaboard by tropical storms Fred and Henri.

Hurricane Henri is moving my way. Shoved the last of my food in my mouth this morning before I set off for a wet, rocky, and slippery 10 miles to a little farmstand where I shoved some more food in my mouth. Apple cider donuts were bomb.com, but between the sugar rush, a meaty and cheesy breakfast burrito, and a big cup of coffee, I was in a fog walking out. Apparently my body can only thrive off Cliff bars and potato chips now. But after climbing a bit I felt better. The rain picked up and felt amazing compared to the intense humidity of late. Crossed into New Jersey today. Lovin the accents out here. Found a place to stay in a cute little town with a former thru-hiker turned pastor who has turned his basement into a mini hostel. So thankful for a roof to sleep under on a night like tonight. Braved the storm to run down to the local watering hole for some grub. And a typical rainy, small town Sunday night it was with all the locals drinking their sorrows away, having waaaaay too much fun, and making me feel right at home. It was also the town's 150 year anniversary of being a town, so maybe that was fueling the fun. Some delicious food, scored a free appetizer, a free beer, a free hat and koozie, and some free laughs and new friends ü§ô<br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #backpacknewyork #backpacknewjersey #zebratales

We had a few, short climbs and the one right out of camp was pretty steep.  The descent down into Gorham was pretty gradual and we made our way into town around 11:30. Around this time I realized I had fully locked my phone by hitting the wrong password in my pocket 10 times without realizing it. At the time I didn‚Äôt realize this meant I needed to find a computer with ITunes and reset my entire phone, so Hot Sauce, Oklahoma, Walk, Too Late, and I all went straight to the Chinese Buffet in Gorham. After getting to the Quality Inn, I started to work on finding a computer in the town and ultimately had to buy a cheap one to reset my phone.  That was an all day event and luckily I had a backup as of a few days back so I only lost 3 days of pictures, not ideal, but could have been worse. We relaxed and had Subway for dinner. <br><br>Day 34 ‚ÄúMt Moriah Climb‚Äù<br>Miles - 8 <br>MM - 298.3 to 306.3<br><br>We got up, had breakfast, and grabbed a hitch from a nice lady here on vacation from NJ, back to the trailhead to hike up Mt. Moriah and into camp for a short day.  The hike up was long and steep in sections but on the way up we hit 300 miles on trail. I took my time and enjoyed the hike today. After reaching the top, the rock slabs came back and we started going down them. The views were really pretty and we had a good night in camp talking to some NOBOs and getting ready for a tough day tomorrow. <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#atsobo2021 #appalachaintrail #appalachaintrail2021 #atsobo #thruhike #thruhike2021 #mainetogeorgia #hikenewhampshire

A quiet walk before I got back into tourist land. Then all the climbs and rocks and sweat. Found some trail magic. A cold Gatorade never tasted so good. Spent the day trying to swat the bugs out of my eyes and trying not to fall off all the cliffs. Doing both at the same time proved quite risky. Vaseline and mosquito spray have become my two new best friends. Since my shorts literally never dry out from all the sweat, my legs are getting rubbed raw and as much as I want to walk around in underwear it might not be the best way to get rides into town. Or maybe it is ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Packed a BLT, chips, and a doube chocolate muffin out for dinner, the ultimate trail dinner. Lucked out finding water in a very dry stretch and called it a night as the random rain drops began to descend. Calling for thunderstorms tomorrow and I'm going into a pretty rocky section so should be quite a doozie.<br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #backpacknewyork #zebratales

Basically the same thing but real food and waaaaay more of it. I packed out a sandwich for dinner and some snacks for today and tomorrow. I keep telling myself I'm gonna start buying less shit-food, but how does one say no to frosted sticky buns when you're starving? And just look at the calories in that thing! Laughed at the bathroom that had a TV in it... in a gas station of all places. Felt much more fueled hiking out with a full belly. Crossed over the Hudson River and then walked through a zoo, a very touristy park and lake, and up Bear Mountain. Walking by so many people in nice clean, white clothes who smelled good. The zoo was quite hilarious, seeing all the animals in cages that I see while hiking. I can see why there are the number of bear encounters there are when people go to a zoo and see a cute bear just laying around, not the least bit scared or threatened by people, which would never happen in the wild. It was actually pretty sad because seeing a bear in the wild is one of the most amazing things and seeing them in a cage was like seeing a pet dog. Had fun playing frogger running across a busy interstate. I forgot how fast cars drive! Hiked all the crazy and rocky up and downs today. It's fairly dry in this section, so I finally have to start planning out where I'm getting water a little more carefully. It didn't even rain today which was a nice break, although I know it's just a teaser before the hurricane hits me tomorrow or the next day. I pushed hard the past couple days doing 30 mile days and it felt nice to do a bit of an easier day today. I think the town food might have helped too üòâ<br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #backpacknewyork #zebratales

Sleep was hard to come by. Still hot as hell. Crossed a bunch of roads today, some farmland, and mostly just rode the green tunnel roller coaster. More rain. All the humidity. My legs and sides where my shorts rub are covered in chafing, heat rash, bug bites, and I don't even know what anymore. It's gross and painful. I don't think my shorts or shoes will ever dry out at this point. Wasn't really hungry all day, I think because of the heat, and decided to skip an off-trail resupply to push bigger miles, but I'm paying for it tonight with the lack of food left in my food bag and my stomach is making noises now that I'm finally done walking. Oh well, I'll get more tomorrow. Exhausted. Just a rough day. <br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #backpacknewyork #zebratales

Getting into the house I see the poster the two boys made for me showing my journey up and down mountains, up ladders, over large truck tires, under waterfalls and eagles bringing me snacks.  Pretty accurate.<br><br>Later Nicole makes dinner and we sit around and chat, But that poster and the work, the detail and imagination that went into it are never far from my mind.  Thanks Brandon, Nicole and family.  Best Nero Ever!<br><br>#atsobo<br>#atsobo2021

The crew for this day was Walk, Hot Sauce, Too Late, and me. We started the morning with a short climb to the top of the Mahoosuc Arm. I twisted my ankle and ate it walking around the pond first thing in the morning, great start to the day. When we got up top we had the most amazing views of the mountains in Maine and New Hampshire. The rain from yesterday completely cleared and it was a perfect day. Mt. Washington is imposing and continues to get closer to us. We then started the descent down the Mahoosuc arm.  This was absolutely brutal, at some points the rocks we were sliding down seemed straight up and down.  It took us a while to get that done. Then we headed into the Mahoosuc Notch which is a mile of Boulder scrambling that is known as the hardest and slowest mile on the AT. It was an absolute blast. We climbed and crawled our way through boulders, caves, and rocks for an hour and a half and it was over. We all had fun and the next climb showed us just how much energy we used getting through the notch.  After that climb, we had a bunch more up and down remaining.  I took a really bad spill on one of the descents, and got very lucky my knees landed on soft ground. I did a lot more sliding down on my rear end after that one. The Goose Eye Mountains contained a lot of ladders, rock scrambling, and overall sketchy climbing and descending, but we finally made it to the shelter around 5.  We were all wrecked when we got into camp, which is a half mile from the New Hampshire border. Maine certainly won‚Äôt let us go without a fight, but this was one of the most challenging and rewarding days of hiking on the trail. <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#atsobo2021 #appalachaintrail #appalachaintrail2021 #atsobo #thruhike #thruhike2021 #hikemaine #hikenewhampshire #mainetogeorgia

Luckily, I woke up and the burns were mostly healed so it was time to make up the miles.  We were still at the house with Amy and it was beautiful. I got up early and Shon took me to the trailhead. I hiked the 10 miles quick so I could maximize my time off before we all hit the trail again the next day. Baldpate was gorgeous and I had great views of Old Speck and Mt. Washington.  When I got down to Grafton Notch, the crew was there waiting for me and giving out trail magic.  We hung around and gave some snacks and sodas away to some NOBOs.  We went back to the house, ate a big dinner, and watched Dumb and Dumber.  It was a great few days at the AirBnB in Bethel.  Thanks again Amy for booking it!<br><br>I locked my phone in my pocket a few days later, had to reset my phone, and lost my pictures between Grafton Notch and Gorham, NH.  I have my summaries and will post them with the limited pictures I have. I was with @2021_walk_thruhike and @rance_rambles the entire section and they have good pictures on their pages.<br><br>Day 30 ‚ÄúRainy Final 4K in Maine‚Äù<br>Miles - 4.6<br>MM - 267.2 to 271.8<br><br>Amy dropped us off around 9:30 and started on her way home. We started on a short day up Old Speck which is our last 4K in Maine. It was a steep and steady climb and we stopped for water about a mile up. The entire mile up had waterfalls that were running quickly due to the rain before we got to the trail. A we were making our way up, it began to cloud up and rained hard on us for the remainder of the hike. At one point with some lightening and thunder. It was very windy and exposed on the backside of Old Speck and we slowly descended to the campsite for the night, which was our first AMC campsite so we had to pay to use it. Either way, after being drenched we were happy to be in the shelter early. It actually cleared up later in the day and turned out to be nice. <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachaintrail #appalachaintrail2021 #atsobo2021 #atsobo #thruhike #thruhike2021 #hikemaine #mainetogeorgia

No luck. It was a good day of climbing and great views, the heat and humidity had kicked back in in full force and I definitely conserved water today. When I was first in Maine, you literally could trip over a water hole everywhere, but now water spots are few and far between and controlling my output versus sweat versus water consumption had become a priority.  I saved a couple bags of electrolytes from @theinfinitloop specifically for a day like today. Rocket fuel for me. And make it to Pleasant Pond lean to and meet some amazing Appalachian Trail Conservancy surveyors who were out marking the boundaries of the AT. They kindly give me a PBR beer and answer my barrage of questions and offer me to play a game of foursquare but I and my feet decline ü§£. I look forward to New Hampshire in my next section, I‚Äôm absolutely in love with the Alpine Zone and sick and tired of the green tunnel.

The views are amazing but they do no justice more than those that I‚Äôve seen in the Adirondacks. I will say that I‚Äôm happy to see others enjoying their epic adventures, most of which seem to be doing with a long standing tramily. Which I admire and jealous of. Took a nero at Shaws. I proceeded out the next morning hell bent on doing my longest day. Over 19 miles later, I make it to Moxie Bald Mountain Lean to and arrive a little later than I liked.

Between the last nights lien two and the next lien two called Carl Newhall, there was no water, so I carried 4.5 L up the mountain, made a rather arduous climb even more than that. Got a good summit and couple photos and noticed the clouds were coming. Shortly thereafter the sky lit up with a thunderstorm and had to hunker down in between two mountains with my poncho on sitting on the ground like a weable wobble. The trail thereafter was nothing more than shoe and ankle deep water‚Ä¶oh joy. AT -1 , Holliday - 0.

No cold instant Folgers for me! Tommy, my gracious farm host drove me down to the country store, the only place to eat, shop, and pretty much hang out in town where I loaded up on calories and yes, more coffee. A dad and his three kids were sitting by me and I got to answer all of their very inquisitive questions regarding what I was doing. They wanted to know if I was walking back to California when I was done üòÜ I walked back to the trailhead and jumped right into the climbs and the bugs. At one point the trail tricked me into thinking it was going to be an easy day with a few miles walking along the river. But then it climbed back up into the hills for what had to be one of the most ridiculous sections of trail. I guess the trail used to run through lush valley farmland but some rich farmers gave the ATC a buttload of money to reroute it. So they did and apparently hired a drunkard to navigate where it would go. Like a kids roller coaster, up and down, over all the rocks, never going to the top, never going to the bottom. Just slightly frustrating. But hey, that's the AT for ya! After getting lost a couple times and almost losing my phone I wasn't in the best spirits, but then I crossed the border into New York and suddenly the trail improved! ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I put an uplifting audiobook on which helped get me out of my funk and enjoyed some strenuous, but more purposeful climbs for the afternoon. I finally felt like I could get a bit of a stride going instead of all the stumbling over rocks and roots. I pushed a longer day than expected after the water source I was banking on ended up dry, but finally found a dribbling stream and a stealth spot. I can hear all the animal noises and a train running by and the clouds and wind are threatening rain it appears. I'm exhausted, but accomplished feeling. I'm always amazed how many diverse emotions can run through me within one day of walking, but I was reminded today that it is my outlook and mindset that will direct my experiences and no matter the circumstances, really anywhere in life, I can control my emotions, feelings, and experience of it. Feeling gratitude, peace, and tired content.

Passed by some logging operations. The smell of fresh cut timber smells soooooo good. Got rained on off and on, but the rest of the day was pretty dang warm. Passed through a couple farms. Walked along the Housatonic River for a few miles. All the nice houses. I walked by a ridiculously nice high school. I'm definitely in the higher class portion of the state. I've walked over 700 miles of this trail now. About a third of the way done. Ended the day staying with a local dude from Cornwall who owns a dairy farm. He made me a stew with fresh bread and the best ever fresh cheese and homemade wine. Real food never tasted so good. Unfortunately consuming half the crockpot didn't even fill me up though. Relaxed on the porch and watched as the world slowly went to sleep. When I commented about how nice all the homes were in Connecticut and what a relaxing and cozy place it seemed, his response was "nothing much really happens in Connecticut." I could get used to that. The crickets are chirping. I'm sleeping on a mattress in an old farmhouse. Life is pretty swell. <br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #backpackconnecticut #zebratales

I am currently staying at the legendary Shaw's hiker hostel in Monson, Maine. I had planned for the 100 Mile Wilderness to take me 5-6 days, it took me 7. I was quite ambitious trying to crank out multiple 20+ mile days at the start and my body let me know that. My back broke out as if I was 14 again from the heat / moisture / and pack rubbing, my feet are sore. Aka I&nbsp;hurt.&nbsp;All of that to say, I took my foot off the gas pedal and am happy about it. Why rush ? My competitive spirit took hold of my mindset a couple of days, but for what purpose? Sure I set the goal of finishing by November 10th, but I have no real dead line. This has been a goal of mine for so long, I am going to ease my way into it a little nicer and truly appreciate the opportunity of being on this trail.&nbsp;<br><br>My favorite part of the 100 Mile Wilderness was White Cap mtn. I watched the sunset / sunrise on top of it with Katahdin in the background, and quite frankly, it was euphoric. I enjoy the physical challenge, I've found that my mind wanders all over the place throughout hiking all day. I think about people I love, places I've been, past experiences ( good and bad ). Something I try to do every morning is to practice positive self talk , and show myself self love. This makes the hard times hiking go a little easier. " You've got this !" Not " Why are you out here, you can't do this ". This does not mean negative thoughts don't cross my mind, especially on mile 15 when I have 3 more to go to get to my goal campsite.<br><br>I've met some really great people, that all have such interesting stories from all walks of life. <br><br>//<br>I couldn't type more, the rest is on my blog !<br>https://williamlangfordat.blogspot.com/?m=1<br>@appalachian.trail<br><br>#seekthejoyofbeingalive #atsobo2021

Somehow almost got lost along the way. I just couldn't believe the trail was turning in the complete opposite direction of the way I had just came. But of course it does, because that's the AT for ya!!! Got a hitch into Great Barrington from a dude who owns a motocross racetrack in upstate 6Nee York. How cool is that! He drove me halfway to the grocery store and then an old man who couldn't hear and kept his blinker on the whole time drove me the rest of the way. Priority #1... second breakfast. I don't know why I've been craving McDonalds so much lately but it was right beside the store so I could not say no!!! Grocery shopped and then got a ride back to the trail from a guy from Puerto Rico. He drove me out of his way even though he was technically working and supposed to be delivering tires to New York. People are awesome. And I always have the best hitches with people who know nothing about the trail, don't know I'm a thru-hiker and still pick up a dirty homeless-looking girl anyways. Then I ran through some farms and away from the mosquitoes and into Connecticut. Connecticut had a nice way to welcome me with rocky ridiculous trails. Sometimes I look at all the nice looking forest floor they could have put the trail on and can't help but scratch my head and try to figure out why the heck they insisted on following it up and over every rock imaginable. Climbed up to the highest point in CT, a whopping 2350ish feet!! Made it to a shelter as the sun was setting and had the whole thing to myself since the few others there were tenting so I did some yoga and stretched and snuggled up in my sleeping bag since it's already getting cold with a projected weeklong storm coming in tomorrow. <br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #backpackconnecticut #zebratales

All the smells and sounds and hardly any sweat. Such a foreign feeling. Found a cute farm stand that was selling some snacks. Just in time since my food is starting to run low. Pretty fields and flowers. Today is the first day I haven't seen a bunch of NOBOs. I wonder if I'm nearing the end of them. The trail is starting to get a bit dryer. Up until now water has been ridiculously abundant. Although I'm sure it will turn into another mud pit when it rains again in a couple days üòÜ Saw a couple deer. Surprisingly there have been virtually no deer in New England so far. Long day. Lots of stumbling over roots.

My feet felt much better today with the Superfeet insoles I bought yesterday. I actually felt like I could walk normally instead of tip-toeing along the trail trying to put as little pressure on my feet as possible like I have been doing. Thank goodness. I was really starting to question how I was going to survive another 1500 miles in so much pain. I still tripped on a million roots and rocks, but at least I wasn't cursing my feet every second. The weather finally cooled down today. Felt amazing. Today is the first day I have started smelling the trail. The freshest and most foresty smells and the most rotten smells at a few bogs. I've been surprised up til now that I wasn't getting any nature smells, but for some reason they all came alive today. Found a lake to camp by with a couple fun NOBOs. I guess you're not supposed to stealth camp in MA, but we determined our campsite to be pretty established-looking and called it good.&nbsp;Laughed about ridiculous hikers and hostel owners. Forgot that cold soaking rice takes way longer than top ramen does and had some crunchy rice for dinner. The tree tops are blowing in the wind and my tent is snuggly on this perfect New England night. <br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #backpackmassachusetts #zebratales

Passed into Massachusetts along the way. Swung by the store to pickup more food. A lady stopped me and asked if I was hiking the trail and insisted on giving me a pen (why I would need a pen I have no idea) and some rosary beads. She even hugged me. I can't imagine I smelled too great as I'm dripping with sweat and mud. Sat outside the store and stuffed my face with food. Found some trail magic walking out of town. Climbed a few mountains. Found a war statue. Climbed down another mountain. Got some insoles for my shoes at a gear shop. And a free beer. Really hoping these insoles solve my feet problems. I've gotten used to hiking with my feet hurting all day, but now they are keeping me up at night from the pain so that is just going to have to end. Looked down at my legs today and they were covered in bumps. Pretty sure it's a heat rash. I might be slightly dehydrated from this heat wave. Found a spot to camp in the cute town of Cheshire. A crazy trail angel brought us some donuts and chips and I hung out with some NOBO hikers until the lightning started. We ran into our tents before the downpour came and watched the sky light up for a couple hours.<br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #backpackmassachusetts #zebratales

These two finished section hiking the AT in 2013 - legends. And another shout out to the guy at the grocery store who gave us a couple cold waters and to a lovely woman called Amy who overheard our conversation at a restaurant in town last night and gave our table some money to help with our bill.

So great meeting you Snips! <br><br>Photos by: @justin_goodhart_photography <br><br>#pawlingny #harlemvalley #appalachiantrail<br>. .<br>.<br>.<br>#makeportraits #hudsonvalley #photoshoot #makeportraitsnotwar #harlemvalleyatcommunity @harlemvalleyatcommunity @nynjtc @iloveny #upstateny @appalachiantrail  #trailmagic #humansofnewyork #dutchesscounty #environmentalportrait #neverstopexploring  #nikonnofilter #athiker #appalachiantrail2021 #appalachiantrailconservancy @appalachianmountainclub @appalachian.trail #athiker2021 #trektheat  #wildeast #hitthetrail #whiteblaze #atclassof2021 #appalachianhikers #appalachiantrailthruhike #atsobo2021 #sobo2021 #2021thruhike #hikehappy

I get up early and walk to McD's for some final town calories before going back into the Whites. <br><br>I am dropped off at Pinkham Notch, connecting footsteps from yesterday and start walking at 0815.  The plan today is up,up, up to Mt. Madison and Washington. Then down, down, down to Mizpah hut.  In short, just another Friday on the AT.<br><br>On Mt  Washington,  I reassess today's walk and figure I will make it to the hut and nearby tentsite around dark.  But it's the AT in NH, so add 30%. So I better hurry or..... buy more ice cream and tent somewhere else.  Ice cream wins.  Ice cream always wins.<br><br> Just before leaving the top, a tourist hands me a VT Long Trail Ale  Dinner tonight just became gourmet. <br><br>2.5mi fro Mizpah I break off the AT and hike down the Mt.

Gatorade and Fritos are the perfect antidote to this humidity. And good climbing fuel. We've been in a heat wave all week but it finally broke for a second this afternoon with a massive thunderstorm. I always know when it is about to start pouring. It gets really dark, the wind picks up and then goes silent and all the birds stop singing. And then it goes from silent to the loudest downpour you have ever heard in seconds. You would think the forest canopy would shield some of the rain, but I was soaked and walking through a river of a trail instantly. Thunder cracked right overhead and it was so dark I could barely see the trail. Eventually it stopped, but there was no drying out of anything today. I found a shelter in the evening and a ton of other hikers. Everyone decided to camp so I have the shelter to myself, but now that the mosquitoes are back out in full force I might regret my decision. We swapped trail stories, discussed the worst dehydrated meals, and laughed as one hiker tried to stomach knock-off mac n cheese. I've never seen anything look so gross. You know it's really bad if a thru-hiker won't eat it. <br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #backpackvermont #zebratales

So it was quite surprising when I woke up to an insane downpour in the middle of the night. All three of us camping there quickly scrambled to button up our tents. It only lasted about ten minutes, but it sounded like a warzone. Woke up starving and wandered back to McDonalds for breakfast which was surprisingly pretty good and gave me some much needed salt, but sadly even McDonalds doesn't fill me up anymore. Hitched back to trail and spent the day slogging from one mud wash to the next. Humid. Lots of obstacles. One of those days that you just walk and walk and can never take your eyes off the ground. So exhausted by the end of the day. Haven't been sleeping well recently, so hopefully I will tonight!<br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #backpackvermont #zebratales

I get a kick out of the people that say you‚Äôre on vacation for 5 months while you‚Äôre thru hiking. But over all it was an amazing trip through the 100 mile wildernesses and summiting katahdin. Finally saw moose while on trail!! Met so many awesome people this last week and a half. One of them was Jeff who has been hiking since December 6th and started in key west, he already had 4100 miles logged this year. His journey doesn‚Äôt end until he gets to Nova Scotia. When I asked what made him want to do this he responded with ‚ÄúI just wanted to do something epic‚Äù! I just think that‚Äôs such an amazing answer. Best of luck to him and the 780 ish miles he had left after katahdin. #atsobo2021 #cdt2021 #appalachiantrail #katahdin #iat #Hikertrash

We were greeted on trail with a climb to start, straight back down and then back up again. After the second climb, I realized that my back, legs, and arms were all chafed.  I think I had an adverse reaction to the laundry detergent that we used. It came in more as a chemical burn than anything else. We hiked with Hot Sauce and Too Late today as well. We had a nice descent down to the road and went back to the cabin for our last night. Once we got back, Scott Jurek‚Äôs crew was at the Cabin waiting for him to come to the road crossing we passed yesterday. He is attempting to set the fastest known time for hiking the Appalachian Trail which is currently just over 41 days. Was pretty cool getting to quickly talk to the folks supporting him. We had dinner and I got aquaphor put on all of my chafe spots. Hopefully I can hike tomorrow, as the rash is all over my back and arms where my pack sits. Either way, the end of Maine is near. <br><br>Day 27 ‚ÄúFirst Unplanned Zero‚Äù<br>Miles - 0<br>MM - 256.9<br><br>I woke up after a restless night of sleep and my back hadn‚Äôt recovered from the burns as much as I needed to hike. So everyone took off and I had another zero in store. We found out Scott Jurek had hurt his leg and was ending his FKT attempt, so that was a bummer, but I‚Äôm sure it was a tough decision for him and his crew to make. I went to Walmart to get some cream and Benadryl, as the pain from the burns is pretty brutal. I sat around and talked with a few hikers - Dirty Pasta, Late Start, and Oklahoma. Then Walk and the guys picked me up from The Cabin. Walk and Amy rented an Airbnb in Bethel for a few days to visit so I have a couple days to make up my missed miles and relax before we head into the Mahoosucs and  New Hampshire. Easy and I had the hardest time finding bread and rolls in Bethel, but ultimately we found some after about 4 stops. We ate a big dinner of steak, burgers, and hot dogs, relaxed and went to bed.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachaintrail #appalachaintrail2021 #atsobo2021 #atclassof2021 #atsobo #thruhike #thruhike2021

I've decided that I'm not really hiking this trail. It's more of a stumble/falling/hopping kinda motion that I am slowly starting to grasp. Rolling my ankle, landing on my butt, catching myself from almost face planting, slamming my feet into roots and rocks is just a normal day on trail now. I came out here to challenge myself knowing this trail had all the things that I don't really like about hiking. Wet, buggy, muddy, very few views, walking in the forest all day, bad terrain, pointless ups and downs, climbs without rewards, no epic sunsets and sunrises, lots of people. But that is exactly why I'm here. How am I ever gonna get better if I don't push myself outside my comfort zone and do the hard things, the things I'm not good at? I've been out here almost a month and it's kicked my butt. There's good days and bad days. Today was a good day. I can't say I love this trail yet or that it feels like home, but it's starting to grow on me. It's already taught me a lot about myself and humbled me so hard. It's also shown me that I can push through some really hard shit and push past the pain and frustration. It's allowed me to meet so many more amazing people and given me one more reminder that people are awesome, we are all in this crazy world together, we are more alike than we are different, and all I need is a backpack and some food to live and be happy. Camping behind the local VFW hall in town tonight with a couple other hikers and stuffing my face off McDonald's dollar menu in true hiker trash fashion.<br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #backpackvermont #zebratales

I took advantage of road and shuttle opportunities to slack-pack a 21 mile section over the Wildcat, Carter, and Moriah peaks...about 7 named peaks in all. I thought this would be an easy day given my UL pack but I was wrong once again. Climbs of 1000' in half a mile and 2000' in 1.5 miles were the order of the day. Up down up down. But the phenomenal views we had of Mt. Washington were worth it! I hiked with Toe Jam, a SOBO I met in Gorham. I'm going to blame this crazy hard and long day (hiking over 12 hrs from 0630 to 1900) on him but who are we kidding, you all know my track record for doing stupid long days. Still, he was the one who put the idea in my head. Was great to have a hiking companion for a change and the weather was good, if a bit hot...in the 90s the next few days and heat index of 99...more craziness. Finished the day eating heavy cals at the BBQ joint in town. Look at Toe Jam diving into ribs and pulled pork... he's a vegan but this is what this trail will do to you! BROKEN. #atsobo2021, #purplerainadventureskirts

I pushed a 78 mile stretch in 3.5 days to get to Gorham NH and it about broke me. One day was 25 miles with over 10,300 feet of vertical gain... it's a long story you can read in the blog, culminating with heavy rain and a lightning strike on the ridge in front of me. The next day was even more life-threatening fun coming down vertical wet slab rock over and over and clambering across house-sized boulders for a mile in the Mahoosuc notch, also all very wet and slippery. I screamed with joy to pass into NH, where I was rewarded with another steep climb up a mountain and overgrown trail. I completed all of the AT in Maine (282 miles) in 14 days, so I can at least say I did my best and proved that I can survive a backpacking trip in Maine now that I'm older, wiser, and better prepared. No rest for the weary, I begin the higher elevation and very exposed stretches of the Whites next. #purplerainadventureskirts #atsobo2021

I carried trail mix 78 miles and across state lines to feed it to the chucks! They were just waiting for me at the shuttle stop, appearing out of the woods kind of like me, and some of the friendliest ladies I've had the pleasure to cuddle. I hugged 3, including a rooster! I met Bruce the mastiff black lab on top Wildcat...125 lbs at 16 months...a beast! Not as many animal pettings as I got on a regular basis on Te Araroa but still a great showing of late. #purplerainadventureskirts #atsobo2021

As is hot coffee. And a breakfast prepared for you. After coffee, yerba tea that the hostel makes and sells themselves, fruit, jam and toast, and bulgar (still no idea what it is) topped with tomatoes and feta cheese, I had all the energy in the word to run up Mt. Killington. It didn't kill me despite the name, but the clouds did kill the view. The rest of the day was spent cruising through the forest and up and down lots of little hills. A nice day to be in the forest with the high humidity. The trail joined up with the Long Trail yesterday so now I am seeing a lot more hikers who are doing that trail along with all the AT NOBOs. It's kinda comical to see the big difference between most AT NOBOs who are moving pretty quickly now that they are getting towards the end of their hike and the Long Trail NOBOs who are still just starting and some of them with insanely massive packs. I saw one guy who must have had 80 pounds of gear on his pack. I pushed 25 miles despite getting a late start coming from town and found a fellow hiker at the shelter who also hiked the PCT in 2017, the same year I did. It was so fun to laugh about that crazy year. I taped the arches of my feet this morning with the last of my leukotape and between that, some rest, and just telling myself to stop crying about my feet and just hike and forget about it, I had a pretty good day and think the feet might just be on the mend. Mind over matter right?<br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #backpackvermont #zebratales

Short ups and downs followed as we made our way further into Southern Maine.  We stopped quickly on a sandy beach early in the day and ultimately had lunch down at the bottom of Bemis Mountain. We ended the day with a climb up to Bemis Mountain Second Peak. I kept referring to it as Bevis Mountain by mistake. Bemis had a large rock top of the mountain that was neat to walk through and it rained hard for about 15 minutes prior to me getting into camp. Luckily there was room in the shelter and I got dried off and went to sleep after watching some downloaded Chappell‚Äôs Show episodes‚Ä¶.luxury on the trail. <br><br>Day 25 ‚ÄúOld Blue and False Peaks‚Äù<br>Miles - 8.7<br>MM - 238.1 to 246.8<br><br>We started out the morning heading to the top of Bemis Mountain. It felt like the mountain had 8 false peaks and when we finally got to the top, it was a wooded peak with a sign.  We headed down the mountain to set up a climb up to Old Blue Mountain. The climb up was fairly gradual and when we got to the top we hung out for a bit before starting the descent to the road.  We had about 2 miles and 2400 feet to descend. We met a couple more folks moving southbound - hot sauce, Pete, and too late. We got to the road and headed into town for a couple nights at The Cabin in Andover. <br><br>Day 26 ‚ÄúThe Cabin Zero‚Äù<br>Miles - 0<br>MM - 246.8<br><br>Southern Maine is wearing us down so we decided to zero at The Cabin.  The Cabin was a super cool little hostel in Maine. They provide breakfast and dinner and it is made family style around a large table. We had chicken, sweet corn, green beans, salad, and potato salad last night. For breakfast, eggs, potatoes, sausage, pancakes, and fruit.  Tonight is lasagna, and everything has been excellent. Hot Sauce and I ran to Walmart in Mexico, ME with Honey, who owns the cabin and has been such a great host. I grabbed some snacks and shorts to hold me over until Amy gets here Wednesday with my new ones. We‚Äôre heading back out for a couple days before Amy gets here later in the week - closing in on the end of Maine. <br>#atsobo2021 #appalachaintrail2021

The climb up to Saddleback Junior was short and steep and we were rewarded with some great views. The climb up to the Horn and then Saddleback Mountain was awesome. Once we got above treeline on the first, we stayed up on the ridge until we got into our decent into Rangely.  The views were crazy and hiking above treeline reminded us of hiking in the Whites last year (coming up in a few weeks, again). We got into Rangeley and decided to sleep on some cotton at the Saddleback Inn. Some town food, resupply, and a night under a roof and we‚Äôll be out working our way to Andover, ME next. <br><br>Day 23 ‚ÄúRangeley Nero‚Äù<br>Miles - 4.8<br>MM - 220.4 to 225.2<br><br>We stayed at the Rangeley Saddleback Inn and decided to get our money‚Äôs worth and sleep in and relax in the hotel room. We resupplied, grabbed some food and got out of town around noon. Rangeley was a pretty neat town with lots of people visiting on vacation - definitely the biggest town we‚Äôve been in. The miles to Andover broke up a little weirdly so instead of hiking two longer days, we decided a short day out of town and two normal days was the best, so we enjoyed our short few miles out of town and hung in camp with some NOBOs as they rolled in. We also had a bull moose in camp around 2 AM, I slept right through it, but a few others in camp saw him.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachaintrail #appalachaintrail2021 #atsobo2021 #atsobo #atclassof2021 #thruhike #thruhike2021 #hikemaine #mainetogeorgia

We felt vindicated for taking the time to wait on the weather and ready to take on this window of good weather. Clear sky, zero wind or chance of rain. <br><br>The Presidential range involves a 15-mile traverse of extra-terrestrial alpine tundra of slate and bare rock, pure feet grinder material, destroyer of soles and breaker of souls, that makes up the tallest mountains on the whole trail. A series of consecutive 5k footers culminating in Mt. Washington, at over 6k. While it felt otherworldly, it also felt oddly familiar to British ridge walks. This walk is the great leveller of NOBOs and SOBOs alike ‚Äî a universal arse-kicker. But we've been crushing mountains for weeks now so we literally climb these peaks for breakfast.<br><br>Last week we felt humbled, but now we're starting to feel strong. We've been forged in the fire (or should that be bogs) of Southern Maine, so the trail can throw whatever it wants at us now. Steep descents of Webster Cliffs? No problem. 3k of elevation before the stunning miles of Franconia Ridge? Go on then. Nothing is impossible; everything is manageable. One step at a time, one foot in front of the other.<br><br>This week was brutal but so damn rewarding. The wild and wonderful Whites of New Hampshire are absolutely stunning; we could get lost in their rolling peaks for weeks. Alas, we only have a few more miles of their challenging rugged beauty left. It's kind of bittersweet. On the one hand, we'll hit Vermont in a week or so and start flying and hitting 20+ mile days on more accommodating terrain. On the other... these mountains just do something to me. Holed up in Woodstock, NH looking out over these giant green monoliths, we can't help but feel like we'll miss the agony and ecstasy of summiting these beasts. Or could be that we're delirious with exhaustion!<br><br>#atclassof2021 #atsobo2021

Woke up to a misty morning. Hot coffee and a hard boiled egg from the trail angel. Wow people are amazing. Started climbing through some beautiful flowery fields. It got really hot. Like 100% humidity and high 80s kinda hot. Just drenched in sweat. But all I could think about was the movie White Christmas, since part of it is set in Vermont and I daydreamed about how pretty it must be in the snow. Passed quite a few farmhouses today too. Found two different soda trail magic coolers today. I never really drink soda so they didn't leave me feeling so great afterwards. Gonna be hard, but definitely gonna have to skip all the soda trail magic going forward. My feet felt ok for like half the day, but after I took a break, they were wrecked the second half of the day. I wanted to push on while the weather is decent, but my feet were absolutely killing me after about 23 miles. So frustrating. I've had sore and achy feet on other thru hikes, but never to this severity and for 25 days straight!!! <br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #backpackvermont #zebratales

Walked through misty fields and by a misty cemetary. Starting to see rock walls throughout the forest. Felt very New Englandy. Oh, and of course alllll the mud. The trail pops out right by Dartmouth College and then walks through the ritzy college town of Hanover which was quite a change of pace from the mountains and small towns I've been in. Hiker trash and rich frat kids. What a mix. Got a free donut and a free slice of pizza. Met a million NOBOs. Rode the free bus down to the cheaper town of Lebanon to resupply and find new shoes. Made friends with the bus drivers after they picked me up for what seemed like the millionth time in a quest to find shoes. Hiked out of town and wandered into Vermont. Two states down, who knows how many more to come. Wandered through the forests and popped out in the cute little community of Hartford where a wonderful trail angel lets hikers stay in their barn or camp on the lawn and gives out free sodas. People are awesome. A lumpy mattress in an old barn sounds way better than setting up my tent. A beautiful sunset. More hikers. More laughs. Life is good. <br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #girlswhohike #backpacknewhampshire #backpackvermont #zebratales

Woke up around 10:45 hearing voices and seeing flashlights. Thought it was night hikers at first. But then more pass by and they're loud and sounding drunk. They obviously don't see my tent or don't care. I doze in and out of people going back and forth along the trail. I hear music and shouting start up in the distance. Just a backcountry Thursday night party. Eventually I tune out the noise and fall asleep. Wake up and get trucking up another mountain. All the sweat now that I'm out of the cold alpine mountains. I don't sense the humidity anymore now that I'm acclimated, but sweat pours from my forehead, nose, chin, and elbows every time I climb. I find a cool old fire lookout. I hitch a few miles into Lyme and pack out a beer and sandwich for dinner to celebrate finishing the Whites. Meet a NOBO and we get a ride back to trail with a guy who hiked the trail in '95 and wrote a dissertation on how the trail changes hikers with the main takeaway being that it restores their faith in humanity. I can't agree more. He also tells us the town of Lyme is the wealthiest town in New England. Pretty dang cute for a rich town. I climb some more and find an epic little stealth camping spot on an island between two arms of a brook. I camp with a couple NOBOs and their dog. We laugh and talk trail and life and life is good. I laugh about the fact I'm drinking a Sierra Nevada in New Hampshire, but my choices were either crap beer or California beer. Go figure. We attempt a fire which is pretty, but doesn't do much with the wet wood. Does New England ever dry out? Another night falling asleep to the wonderful sound of running water. Mmmmm.<br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #girlswhohike #backpacknewhampshire&nbsp; #zebratales

Ahhhhhh relief. A long downhill and then climbed Mt. Moosilauke, my last big mountain in the White Mountains. The trail slowly got less steep throughout the day as I left the Whites. Well at least I wasn't climbing straight up and down anymore. I was finally able to increase my hiking speed when I wasn't navigating the thick mud which apparently is just never ending with the crazy rains New England has had this summer. It was such a nice relief to not feel utter exhaustion all day. My feet are still absolutely destroyed from the Whites, but I am hoping that will get better as the terrain gets a little less rocky and maybe get a new pair of shoes soon. I'm hoping I just have tendonitis and not something more serious like stress fractures, but only time will tell. It was a quiet day as I get away from the touristy mountains that draw the mass of day hikers. Up until now the trail has been so technical that I have to pay attention to every step and the climbs have come nonstop so I've just been hiking and not listening to anything so that I can fully concentrate on the trail. Since I finally had a chance to breathe today and in an effort to take my mind off my feet I listened to a couple podcasts in the afternoon which was a nice change. The trees and landscape are changing along with the terrain. The mosquitos are back now that I'm out of the alpine mountains. Grrr. Found trail magic at the end of the day. Camping between a brook and a road, so hopefully the cars will stop as it gets dark and I can fall asleep to the sound of running water.<br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #girlswhohike #backpacknewhampshire&nbsp; #zebratales

Couldn't even fall asleep until after 2 AM. What is wrong with me? Hobbled around like a drunk person every time I got up so I decided to give my feet as much rest as possible and get a late start to the trail. I even washed my clothes in the shower because I was too tired and lazy to walk across the street to the laundromat. I shoved all the calories I could into my mouth and got a ride back out. Climbed the Kinsman Moutains and slogged through mud. Soooooo much mud. Almost lost my poles about a million times when they sunk in. My legs and feet feel like they weigh a million pounds. Thankful for a sunny, dry, and warm day, such a nice change from the recent weather. Already was wishing I had eaten more food in town halfway through the day. I don't know how I can eat more food than I am, but I'm going to have to figure out a way to get more calories in. Literally felt like a zombie all day. All days on the trail are hard, but today was mentally, emotionally, and physically a tough one. You can only slip and fall and kick roots and land in mud puddles for so long before you just start to go crazy. <br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #girlswhohike #backpacknewhampshire&nbsp; #zebratales

We had the biggest climb since Katahdin ahead of us up to North Crocker Mountain of about 3000 feet.  We didn‚Äôt climb it quickly but it seemed much more gradual than we expected. South Crocker Mountain was right after.  Both peaks were wooded and offered little for views. The descent down the Crockers was steep and took us a bit but we were in camp before 3 that afternoon.  We ate up and relaxed a bit before an early bedtime. <br><br>Day 21 ‚ÄúClimbs without Views<br>MIles - 13.1<br>MM - 196.6 to 209.7<br><br>We started our first climb as we left camp, about 1500 feet up to the top of Sugarloaf Mountain. Took a bit but we made the top, and took it easy. That climb was fueled by this ridiculously big peanut butter iced brownie from the Flagstaff general store. We didn‚Äôt go up to the peak of Sugarloaf as it was another .6 mile side trail to the top of the ski slopes on the other side. We hit the 200 mile mark right before we climbed up Spaulding Mountain. We‚Äôre making progress, but it can feel slow at times as Maine has been a tough state to put any sort of big mile days in. Spaulding Mountain also went up to just before the peak, and we passed on the side trail to the top as it was a wooded peak without views.  We descended a bit and had a nice few miles before our last climb of the day up Poplar Ridge. The day-ending climbs are becoming my least favorite, and this one was steep and slow.  We rolled into camp around 6 and grabbed the last spots in the lean to.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachaintrail #appalachaintrail2021 #atsobo2021 #atsobo #thruhike #thruhike2021 #hikemaine #mainetogeorgia

Those two took about an hour and a half, and the views were incredible. This was our first 4000 ft peak since Katahdin, and the West Peak was slightly higher than Avery. We made our way down the mountains after hitting the peak of South Horn, and got picked up to go into @themaineroadhouse just outside of Stratton. We got a ton of great food at the Flagstaff general store and settled into the hostel for the night where we ran back into Cooper and Piper as well as a few NOBOs and Flip Floppers.<br><br>Day 19 - ‚ÄúMaine Roadhouse‚Äù<br>Miles - 0<br>MM - 188.2<br><br>Zero day at the Maine Roadhouse.  I can‚Äôt say enough about how awesome our stay was - from the great dinners, good town food, sausage gravy and biscuits for breakfast, the food was great. The bunks had great mattresses and the foot baths were awesome. We watched a bunch of movies and hung out on our day off. The Big Lebowski is @2021_walk_thruhike favorite. I picked up a couple of packages from the post office.  Mom killed it with the resupply and I got a new phone because my Samsung was having issues charging. I spent much of the day setting up my phone, relaxing, and eating. We had chicken parm for dinner and it was great. We went to bed ready to head back out in the morning.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachaintrail #appalachaintrail2021 #atsobo2021 #atsobo #thruhike #thruhike2021 #hikemaine #mainetogeorgia

After finding out that it would be a clear day we set out to go to the Mahoosuc Arm. <br><br>We arrived at the Arm after about 20 minutes of climbing from Old Speck Campsite. The views where clear from the top, which was wind swept and rocky. We crossed over and started going down the Arm. This is one of the steepest climbs on the AT. We descend down 1500 ft in a mile. The trail was covered with tangled roots and huge rock slabs that could be dangerous if it is wet. Luckily for us the weather held. We reached the bottom in a couple of hours. We stopped and took a rest before entering the hardest mile on the AT, the Mahoosuc Notch. <br><br>The Mahoosuc Notch is a .9 section of the AT that is known for its difficulty(some say high level of fun) due to the huge boulders and rocky terrain that you must navigate to get through the Notch. After 2 1/2 hours of rock scrambling we reached the end of the Notch. I enjoyed it because it was so different from what we had already done and I enjoyed it a lot. <br><br>Depending on the weather tomorrow we may zero on the woods at the shelter. The next section of trail is exposed and we don‚Äôt want to climb when there are thunderstorms. We will see how it goes tomorrow morning.<br><br>#appalachiantrail #appalachiantrail2021 #atclassof2021 #atflipflop2021 #almostsobo #outdoors #outside #trails #hike #backpacking #couplesthatbackpack #withguthook #hailstate #hikertrash #atsobo2021 #mainetogeorgia #nature #photography #travelbyfoot #vlog #blog #hikerofinstagram #couplesthathike #walkthisway #mountains #choosemountains #themountainsarecalling #mcdillsonthemove #maine #mountainview

Since Andover, the terrain and trail has gotten noticeably harder. This morning the climb up Baldpate East was ridiculous. The views were amazing but it comes at the cost of being on a huge rock slab that is really exposed. If it was wet it would be very dangerous. Coming up it doesn‚Äôt feel scary it just wears you down.<br><br>We cross the saddle with 360¬∞ clear views and go up Baldpate West. It is a wooded summit but there were views on the way down before getting back under tree line. We stop .5 down at the shelter to have a snack and get out of the rain. Soon after we head down to the parking lot at Maine 26 where we get trail magic and rest a bit before our big climb. <br><br>The big climb up Old Speck is long but it is not difficult. After 3.5 miles we reached the top where the summit trail meets the AT and we continue on down the trail. The north side of Old Speck is straight down with huge rock slabs that kill my ankles. The rock slabs can be really sketchy especially if they are wet. We eventually make it down to Old Speck Campsite. <br><br>This campsite is run by the AMC(Appalachian Mountain Club) so it cost 10 dollars a person to stay here. The site is really nice.

Some smaller mileage days but still feels pretty taxing. This trail is hard. So I decided to make it harder by fording the Kennebec river. I didn't want to wait for the canoe ferry in the rain. I was pretty wet already but the river only got thigh-high. No big deal but definitely shouldn't be done without some prior experience...Te Araroa prepared me well. The rain gave way to a fantastic day in the Bigelows. I took it slow to end up in Stratton and my first night in a hostel bed...I miss my tent. But the Thanksgiving dinner prepared by Jen N Jen of the Maine Roadhouse was spectacular. #purplerainadventureskirts #atsobo2021

Trying to pack up while it's still raining is always fun. The trail is a muddy creek. I try to rock hop for awhile and eventually just give up and walk in the mess. I find a hut in the morning and stuff my face with delicious coffee cake and try to dry out for a second. I meet a bunch of NOBOs. Apparently I'm in another bubble. I take off and climb up and down all the mountains. At some point I run into a guy as I'm heading up a windy climb. He tells me I should turn around and camp and wait out hiking the next section. He says it's too dangerous, the winds are too high, and it's all exposed. He tried to go and had to turn back. One thing I really hate is fear mongering. In real life, but especially on the trail. Everyone has different capabilities and experience and it's so frustrating to see hikers influence other hikers based off their experiences or comfort level. I literally have to walk away from him because he won't stop going off about the conditions. I get up above tree line and you can't see much. There's some crazy wind gusts, but it's totally doable. Never trust a hiker wearing a leather hat. I pop up and over mountain after mountain and finally I get a coule breaks in the clouds and the view is so stunning. I end the day on a crazy descent. My body feels like it has finally hit its max today. Energy is all gone. My feet hurt like no other. Pushing hard through the Whites has definitely put my body to the test. I make it down to the highway and try to hitch into town. No luck on a hitch. I call a shuttle and get a ride in. I find a cheap hotel since all the hostels are booked and lay out all my soaking wet gear hoping it will dry overnight. I sit in my hotel room and stuff my face with as much food as possible. I can't believe how much weight I've already lost. My feet hurt so bad. I don't know how I will ever walk again, let alone hike out tomorrow. Oh well, that's a problem for future Jenn.<br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #girlswhohike #backpacknewhampshire&nbsp; #zebratales

Woke up to a gorgeous sky. The sun was out and I had a fun few miles trekking above tree line through the mountains. I made it to a hut sometime in the morning and stopped in to grab some water and was lucky enough to snag some leftover breakfast. The huts are all off the grid so whatever food doesn't get eaten has to get packed out so of you're lucky enough to time it right, they give the leftovers to thru-hiker. Cold eggs, sausage, and oatmeal never tasted so good. I could have stayed there all day in the cozy hut, but I kept on and made my way down a ridiculous climb down to Crawford Notch. And what do I find, not only one, but two different tents of trail magic. A grilled salmon burger, fruit and veggies, cookies, and hot coffee courtesy of the owner of @triplecrowncoffee. I stuck along way longer than I should of as we all exchanged trail stories and ate as much as I could. There's always a fine line between eating enough to fuel and going overboard and feeling horrible on a climb. I took off when one drunk NOBO who has been there all day started trying to challenge day hikers to pushup competitions. There's always that one guy! After a climb, I actually had some flat miles. I honestly didn't think I was even still on the AT, it was such a stark comparison to the trail up until now. I filled up on water and did one more big climb to end the day and found an epic cliff to camp on that has the most amazing view of all the mountains I just hiked through. It's supposed to rain tonight so I might be regretting my camping choice, but if not it will be an amazing sunrise!<br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #girlswhohike #backpacknewhampshire&nbsp; #zebratales

Soooooo cold outside. Climbed up Wildcat Mountain and then had a crazy long descent down to Pinkham Notch. I hate steep downhills. Takes me forever. But I finally got to the bottom and grabbed hot coffee and a muffin at the visitor center while I quickly dried my gear out. Then it was all the climbing and rock hopping to make my way into The Presidentials. Climbing up Mt. Madison was insane. Every time I tried to stand up I just about got knocked off the mountain from the 70 mph winds. It took every ounce of energy to make it to the Madison Hut. My legs felt like they literally just didn't work anymore. But I went inside and chugged water, shoved all my snacks in my mouth and bought the only dessert they had left... vegan cake. It was gross, but hey it's cheap, had chocolate, and calories and really that's all that matters anymore. I contemplated stealth camping nearby since if I pushed on, I would have to go another eight miles and go up and over Mt. Washington which is one of the most dangerous mountains in the world on a windy day. But I couldn't justify stopping at only 3:30 especially on a rare non-rainy day, so I used my carb loading to my advantage and set off up another mountain. And another. And another. Finally made it to Mt. Washington which can be a ridiculously touristy place on a clear day, especially a Saturday. But with the high winds, the place was practically empty. I braced the wind and cold for a pic and a sweet view and then kept on going to find a place to camp. I made it to Lake of the Clouds hut which usually lets hikers sleep in their basement... except this year. Damn you covid. But I found a gorgeous place to stealth camp below the hut. It's going to be a cold and windy night, but the sunset made it all worth it. <br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #girlswhohike #backpacknewhampshire&nbsp; #zebratales

My body just doesn't know what to do with beds and rest days now apparently. Wake up to the train and cars all night too. More foreign noises. But I wake feeling refreshed. All the breakfast food and waaaaay too much coffee while I wait for the weather to improve. Hit the trail around 9:30. A couple flat miles and then the climbing resumes. And the rain. I pop up on mountain after mountain. Crazy winds on top. No views today. The trail is a mud hole. I rock and root hop all day trying to avoid soaking my feet. No luck. The sun pops out for a sec to tease me. This section of trail is very touristy and has actual enclosed huts every 7 or 8 miles. They're crazy pricey so thru-hikers don't stay in them, but sometimes they'll give us leftover food if they have any after meals. I try my luck before finishing the day. No luck. Oh well. I find a place to stealth camp. The rain comes and goes all evening. Even though I'm relatively dry once I shed my hiking clothes, I can't warm up. The wind is chilling. Gonna be a cold one tonight. I already miss all my new trail friends from the hostel. Most of them stayed in town with the bad weather today. Guess I'll have to make new ones. Cold leftover pizza and knock-off oreos dipped in knock-off peanut butter for dinner. Just another crazy Friday night on the AT.<br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #girlswhohike #backpacknewhampshire&nbsp; #zebratales

No pictures as the 6 miles were quick and pretty flat. We relaxed and ate at a brewery. Moving forward to Stratton tomorrow. <br><br>Day 16 - "Lunch on the Beach"<br>Miles - 14<br>MM - 151.2 to 165.2 <br><br>This was probably the easiest day on trail to date. The terrain was flat and pretty smooth except walking around the ponds. The day started out with canoe trip across the kennebec river and a bit of rugged, yet pretty flat trail. We walked our way to a pond with a sandy beach and had lunch. It was very windy so the ponds had some waves crashing. We made our way into camp early in the evening. A couple NOBOs showed up later and one joined us in the shelter. We found out in the morning he was from Carlisle...we've been running into a fair amount of PA folks. <br><br>Day 17 - "Little Bigelow"<br>Miles -12.6<br>MM - 165.2 to 177.8 <br><br>The day started out colder and very windy. But we were pretty pumped as some bigger climbs were ahead. We had two minor climbs to start the day and then started our climb up to Little Bigelow Mountain. We stopped at a shelter for lunch about a third of the way up. Once we made it to the ledges at the top we got a good look at the remaining peaks in the Bigelows, and we also had our next few mountains in front of us. We got views of the Crockers and Sugarloaf, which has a ski resort visible. We made our way down to a campsite before the climb up to Avery Peak the next morning (2000 ft up). These two days also set us up to be in Stratton on Sunday night.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachaintrail #appalachaintrail2021 #atsobo2021 #thruhike #thruhike2021  #hikemaine #atsobo #mainetogeorgia

And hello New Ham-sha!<br><br>We crossed into NH last week - our most difficult week physically and mentally so far. We have many words to describe our time in Maine (some choice swear words as well...) but the word that will be remembered is HUMBLING.<br><br>Maine has humbled us. We thought we were physically fit when we started this but the trail in Southern Maine has been unforgiving and incredibly tough. Watching your already slow mileage go down to 1 mile an hour at points has been so frustrating. This included going across the Mahoosuc range and the Mahoosuc notch, one of the most difficult miles of the entire trail (took us two hours for the 1 mile boulder scramble). <br><br>But, as the saying goes, 'the trail provides'. After a few rainy, painful days with low morale the skies cleared 15 miles into NH, our tent and gear dried out, we met a brit on the trail (trail name Rugby!) who gave us a taste of home and when we got up to a viewpoint, The Diplomat saw a fellow hiker in a Liverpool top (trail name Sauce) which lifted our spirits massively.<br><br>These pictures show our journey through our difficult week. Now we are resting for a day (a 'zero') in Gorham before we start to tackle The Presidentials tomorrow - can't wait to summit Mt Washington!<br><br>For now - we eat all we can in town (we're both losing weight), commiserate with other hikers, do laundry, resupply food and gear and take care of some achy body parts with a beer in hand. üçª<br><br>#atsobo2021 #atclassof2021 #veganthruhiker #mahoosucnotch #mahooSUCKS #liverpoolfc

Hard to believe he carried it up and down all the roots and rocks just to give it away.

Late afternoon I arrive at Cooper Lodge, after really churning and burning with the expectation that I will be the first one there, however to no avail I am not the first one there and there are already people that have sought out the couple platforms in the building which the roof will not leak on, it is really a shame to see how bad the Cooper Lodge is in a state of disarray, So I find the best tent site for my non-freestanding tent. I return to the lodge and everyone is pretty much playing cards and or eating their evening dinner, I finish up and head back to my tent to turn in for the night, and once again mother nature unleashes a barrage of rain. The rain is so hard that it is actually bouncing up from the ground underneath my rain fly and into the ventilation of my tent and now I am basically on a waterbed as my inflatable mattress is keeping me from being in a total puddle of water. I make some adjustments, sop up the excess water with a small pack towel and hope that the rain will stop. Rain stops, temp drops, and it‚Äôs a brisk evening slumber. <br><br>Day 14 - this morning I wake up with the intention of getting to the top of Killington for my first Vermont 4k‚Äôer. Similar conditions to Katahdin, virtually no visibility and the wind is churning pretty good, I had two thoughts in mind, either continue down or take the gondola down and attempt to find a place to dry out all of my sopping wet gear. Within a few moments the sky unloads on us yet again, it‚Äôs actually kind of getting funny, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever been this wet ever for this long and with such daily consistency. We find a trail to the gondola and descend to it, The lift attendants must‚Äôve felt extremely bad for us because they let us get on the gondola without paying. Soaked once again, LOL. <br><br>Day 15 - I stay the day with a trail angel friend and in the actual sunshine of the day, I‚Äôm able to dry out all my gear. I return to the trail slackpack to White Rocks park.  IT ACTUALLY DOESN‚ÄôT RAIN TODAY.  And the journey continues‚Ä¶#thetrek #atsobo2021 #thruhike #trektheat

Shortly there after I am the only one at the cabin and the skies look ominous, and before darkness falls there are now 14 people in the cabin, plenty of room and most of us are very happy we took shelter here, as Vermont shows us one hell of a thunderstorm and lightning display. <br><br>Day 11 - I meet a ton of great people here that are northbound and we all wake up relatively early and start our day. I‚Äôm heading in the opposite direction of them as I descend the mountain towards Killington. And yet again Vermont and the Appalachian Trail will take their pound of flesh each day and shortly after I crossed through Thundering Falls Boardwalk the sky prepares to unload on me. A very nice gentleman from the Green Mountain Trail crew offers me a ride on one of the dirt roads after the park and takes me to the Inn at Long Trail and I am extremely happy for his kindness as it is raining so hard you can barely see the road in front of us. It rains for quite a bit which hurts my ability to re-supply locally in Killington, so I wait till the following morning and decide to visit the often spoke about Yellow Deli in Rutland, Vermont.<br><br>Day 12 - I spend the day here at the Yellow Deli resting, doing laundry, and re-supplying and ultimately stay the night at the hostel. My feet have taken a turn for the better and it seems as if the footwear change has alleviated the Achilles tendinitis for now.  I only tagged a few folks, I need to get better at remembering. Others to name a few were Frogg with her brother, Road Runner, Capsaicin, Lash, and more!! #thetrek #atsobo2021 #thruhike #trektheat

Solid day with good weather, not the normal ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, as it seems to rain everyday on the trail and at the top of a Vermont PUD (pointless up and down), I get shellacked with a downpour. So much for staying dry today. Looked at Guthook and found a trail angel who takes in Hikers at her ‚ÄúBlue Barn‚Äù. Linda was super nice, fridge full of beverages and 4 more NOBO hikers show up. I proceed to watch them devour a Domino‚Äôs Pizza each within seconds. Hiker Hunger wow. <br><br>Day 8 - Linda at the Blue Barn gives me a lead on another Trail Angel named Dan who lives up and over the mountain on VT RT 12. I come across an awesome trail angel giving trail magic in form of some drinks and freeze pops. I believe her name was ‚ÄúWater Queen‚Äù, I show up late in the day and Dan is also hosting a Warrior Expeditions hiker named ‚ÄúCalamity‚Äù. @amityambles. She‚Äôs an Air Force Vet, been on the trail since Georgia and a wealth of information as I barrage her with questions!! <br><br>Day 9 - Awoke to Vermont at her best with a good soaking rain, I need to resupply and catch a pickup to the Shire in Woodstock, 50% percent off for thru hikers!! Do a quick resupply, laundry and grab a burger at a local Tavern. Wow. I smell. BAD. #thetrek #atsobo2021 #thruhike #trektheat

A storm is coming in. Have a pretty easy five miles down to Route 2 and go into a hostel in Gorham. My first real trail nero. The first shower in 10 days. Much needed. The smell of my socks and shoes... I can't even describe it. Resupply at Dollar General. Livin' that hikertrash life to the fullest. Trying to consume as many calories and let my feet rest as much as possible in my 24 hours off trail. Hikers trickle in throughout the day. Finally meet some more SOBOs. All the trail stories and laughs. Hostel life is the best. Hikers are the best. 30 hikers sharing one bathroom is fun. Find a Canadian beer at the gas station which pairs perfectly with a Trailer Park Boys binge. It rains off and on all day. A good day to be in town. Heading into the White Mountains tomorrow. Weather forecast shows thunderstorms. Such is the AT.<br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #girlswhohike #backpacknewhampshire&nbsp; #zebratales

Got back onto trail around 9. Easy, Walk, and I walked our longest day to date on trail. It was relatively flat and we just bounced around the rivers all day. We made it to camp to an open shelter and settled in for the night. As I was filtering water and watching the frogs in the pond battle for territory, I heard some large animals moving next to me. About 100 yards away, a moose and two calves stood eating vegetation. It was a cool experience to sit and watch them eat. ‚úÖ one goal for this trip.<br><br>Day 14 - "Aching Ankles"<br>Miles - 13.1<br>MM - 132.4 to 145.5 <br><br>Started out with a climb up to the top of Moxie Bald Mountain and dropped right back down the other side. Both Walk and I had ankles that were bothering us today, I'm thinking from twisting them a few times in the past couple of hiking days as well as a little fatigue from nearly 18 miles the day before. We had a couple of flat miles then started the 4 mile ascent up Pleasant Pond mountain. After reaching the top, we hung out a little and then walked down to the shelter at the bottom. Another night in the shelter. Full with us and 2 NOBOs. We met another SOBO, Mike, tonight and about 10 NOBOs ready to finish.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachaintrail #appalachaintrail2021 #thruhike2021 #thruhike #at2021 #atsobo #atsobo2021 #mainetogeorgia #hikemaine #moose

So happy the rain stopped. Although all of my stuff is still pretty wet. Putting on wet shorts, socks, and shoes is super fun üôÑ Climbed up and down all day per usual. Got to pass lots of NOBOs early on and answer all their anxious questions about "The Notch". Found a mountain peak this wasn't whipping with the wind and laid all my stuff out to dry. The good thing about good backpacking gear is it can usually dry out in about 5-10 minutes in direct sunlight. I was starving all day with all the climbing. I think the real hiker hunger is starting to set in where the hunger just never really goes away. Walked through so many muddy bogs today. Luckily there are wooden planks through most of them, but one misstep and you're waist deep in some of the bogs. Almost lost my trekking pole a few times. It was a muddy mess and my shoes and socks were still soaked when I finally ended the day. My feet looked like a dead man's feet. And smelled like one. It's been nine days without a shower or washing my clothes now. I'm sure I smell great. I passed from Maine into New Hampshire today. One state down! And arguably the hardest. New Hampshire is also a contender for the hardest state, specifically because of the White Mountains.

No surprise there. The sky's been hazy for awhile now. Apparently it's the smoke from some fires in Canada. Pass a sign for "An Exceptional View". There is no view. I sweat my butt off climbing a mountain and am greeted with an insane wind on the top. Stop for a snack and am freezing in minutes. Make it down to a trailhead around noon with trail magic. Roast beef sandwich, watermelon, homemade cookies, powerade, and good company. People are awesome. Meet a NOBO who is trying to get a ride to the hospital. He thinks he might have bruised or broke some ribs on a bad fall in the Mahoosuc Notch. It's not the first horror story I've heard about this notch. I pull myself away from the trail magic and climb another mountain. It starts raining in the afternoon. I hit the Mahoosuc Notch around 4:30, rumored as the most technical mile on trail. I've been warned not to attempt it in the rain. It's raining, but hasn't started pouring yet so I go anyways. It's scrambling, crawling, leaping, shimmying up a rocky canyon. It's kinda fun trying to guess where to go. It's a bit slippery in the rain, but I'm fairly careful. There's still ice in some of the crevasses and it's freezing when you get down low. I pass one guy in it. He doesn't seem to be enjoying himself as much. I make it out right as the rain really starts coming down. The mile took me about 45 minutes. I've heard people say it can take up to&nbsp;4 hours in horrible conditions. Ugh. I go off trail to find water and come back to hurry up and set my tent up. I can't find my trekking poles and realize I left them at the creek and run back to find them. On the way back I pass the guy and he's heading out on a side trail. I ask if he's ok. He said he's taking this side trail back to town. He says he needs a cigarette. He shuffles past. His shorts are torn down the back. Life's rough out here sometimes, man. I get my tent set up and crawl in trying not to soak everything. No luck. Oh well. I'm beat. Gonna be a chilly night up here in these rainy mountains. <br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #girlswhohike #backpackmaine&nbsp; #zebratales

Had a quiet morning climbing up and down through the fog and the mud. It's like the hot lava game we played as kids except the lava is mud and you might loose a shoe if you step in the wrong spot. Miles are hard to come by today. Reach a road crossing in the middle of nowhere and stick my thumb out and get picked up a second later. It's always in the most unlikely places that you get a fast hitch. A guy and his son are heading to town for a few camping snacks so they drive me to the store and bring me back to the trail. Fastest resupply of my hiking career I do believe. It's hot and I'm sweaty, but I can't turn down a cup of hot coffee from town. Nothing like some caffeine and carbs to give one an instant hiking boost. The rest of the day is straight up and down every mountain. I'm exhausted as I near the end of the day. I pop out on a road and find a fellow hiker doing trail magic as he is taking some time off trail to rest his knees. A Pepsi, the most delicious apple, and a mini pie are quite a treat. I camp with some NOBOs. Turns out one of them hiked the PCT the same year I did. Probably the 6th person I have met out here with the same story. It's always fun trying to guess where we might have passed each other along the way. We spend the evening eating and talking trail woes and funny stories and they give me the lowdown on all the best (and worst) hostels and restaurants in the south. My mouth is already watering. We're camping by a running brook. Such a soothing sound to fall asleep beside. <br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #girlswhohike #backpackmaine&nbsp; #zebratales

Lots of tossing and turning and snoring and sleeping pad noises. Woke up at 5:30 and couldn't fall back asleep despite waking up all night. No luck hitching this drizzly morning so I walk the couple miles from the shelter back to town. Spent all morning getting the new phone situated with everything I need, downloading apps, checking in with the world, trying to remember all my passwords, scout out the miles ahead. Trying to find breakfast in a ritzy lake town on a Sunday morning... no luck, grocery store breakfast it is. It pours for a few hours so I find a tiny covered spot outside the store to chill, eat, and try and chug coffee to stay warm and let the rain pass. The cashier and I are now on a first name basis after my third trip inside to caffeinate. The rain finally lets up late morning and I get a quick hitch back to trail. The trail is a mudfest and it is beyond foggy. I pass a lake and I can't see 20 feet out into the water. I meet Lorax, a NOBO who is slack-packing this section going south and we hike together most of the day. This is literally the first time I've hiked with anyone on this trail. We talk for hours and the day flies by. A friend of his wife is following them along the trail in their van so when we reach the highway they treat me to drinks and snacks and offer me a place to stay at their house in Montana when I hike the CDT. I mean if I hike the CDT üòâ After all the surplus calories I cruise through the rest of the day and find a shelter to stay at... me and every other NOBO around. The shelter is already packed and I find one of the last halfway decent tent spots. I chat up Gramps who is from Tehachapi and has section hiked the PCT. Hikers mingle, make fires, and mostly eat. All is quiet by 9 PM - hiker midnight. This is the life.<br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #girlswhohike #backpackmaine&nbsp; #zebratales

A bunch of roots and a ton of smallish ups and downs awaited us over the next 12 miles. We are all officially exhausted after 10 days without real (town) food and getting through the 100 MW. We slowly made our way to camp to set us up for a really short next day into Monson. <br><br>Day 11 - " Monson"<br>Miles - 3<br>MM - 111.5 to 114.5 <br><br>Three quick miles in the morning racing the rain before getting into town. We got to the first paved road we've seen in over 11 days. Shaw's came and got us and we got back to the hostel, ate a bunch of town food, got showers, and started relaxing. <br><br>Day 12 - "Zero at Shaw's"<br>Miles - 0<br>MM - 114.5 <br><br>Started the day with Shaw's breakfast - eggs, potatoes, bacon, and blueberry pancakes. The remainder of the day was spent doing town chores - resupplying, getting my package from the post office, and adding a pair of camp shoes to my pack. I had too many nights putting wet shoes back on in camp, so that justifies the weight for now. We relaxed and ate a bunch, and we're ready to head out Tuesday. <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachaintrail #appalachaintrail2021 #at2021 #atsobo #atsobo2021 #hikemaine #mainetogeorgia #thruhike #thruhike2021

The climb up started steep and slow and leveled out before getting up top to get some views of the white cap range. Then the real climbing started. The next half mile felt like it went straight up and finished with a short rock scramble to the top. Difficult but rewarding.&nbsp; My feet were beat so we rolled into Chairback Gap Lean to and set up around 4. Hung out, ate, and Easy got a nice fire going.&nbsp;The nights are getting chillier and have been awesome sleeping. Chairback was amazing and very emotional at the top, seeing what we've accomplished over the past couple days. <br><br>Day 9 - "Tired and Ready for Town Food"<br>Miles 10.9 <br>MM 88.5 to 99.4 <br><br>Started out early and slogged closer to Monson. Long day of rooty and hilly hiking. Rained twice on us for a short time. The first time as were climbing up to Barren Mountain. The second as we walked into the shelter. I stayed in the shelter with 4 NOBO flip flippers - Blue, Clementine, Apples, and Feral.

We left camp early and hiked hard to the base of White Cap Mountain and decided to call it for the day since we had a nice shelter and space to dry off and relax for the afternoon. Saw Pizza and Beer (Jeff) for likely the last time - he was a great resource and hiking buddy for the past few days.&nbsp;The afternoon was spent talking to NOBOs as they came through and picking their brains. Spent the night with Spring Break, Stoney, Snickers, and Mullet. Rained hard all night so the shelter was a great call. The hilly section of the 100 MW awaits us the next 4 days. <br><br>Day 7 - "Rainout on White Cap" <br>Miles 10.8&nbsp; <br>MM - 67.8 to 78.6 <br><br>Woke up today to pouring down rain. We knew since we were starting on an easy pace we didn't have to rush out of camp, so we laid back down. We got up and got out of camp around 8. It was dry for a short time but the remainder of the day was rainy and colder. We had no views on White Cap Mountain. It continued to rain on us the rest of the day, we had a bunch of up and down and a long decent into the shelter. We had some good company in the shelter with some NOBOs dropping knowledge and telling stories. Easy decided he was going to yo-yo the 100 MW 11 times instead of completing the trail, lol.&nbsp; For the second night in a row we fell asleep with rain hitting the shelter roof. That's quickly becoming my favorite sound on trail.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachaintrail<br>#appalachaintrail2021 #at2021 #atsobo #atsobo2021 #thruhike2021 #thruhike #hikemaine #mainetogeorgia

The northbound hike to our "beginning" starts easy enough to the first waterfall, but after that, the next 3 miles are straight uphill with 2 miles of that being boulder scrambles. Once you get above treeline, the views are incredible, which I soaked up while catching my breath on the sketchy scrambles. Once arriving at the peak, our adventure just began and we had 5.2 slow miles to the bottom. We met a ton of other SOBOs on the hike - Cooper and Piper who stayed with us in our campsite; Choo Choo; 2 Easy, and a few others who blew right past us. We set up in camp and ate as much as we could.&nbsp; No one had any trouble sleeping that first night.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachaintrail #appalachaintrail2021<br>#thruhike2021<br>#thruhike #atsobo2021 #atsobo #hikemaine #mainetogeorgia

Found a dope little hidden lean-to close to town which is lucky because Rangeley is a very nice, cute little bed and breakfast kinda town so basically waaaaay outa hikertrash price range for hotels. Five other hikers and I sat around a fire, laughed, shared stories, and then cuddled up in our shelter together. Here's a pic of this massive sandwich I scored for $5. It was as big as my head. Yes I ate the whole thing. <br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #girlswhohike #backpackmaine  #zebratales

So instead here's a pic from Day 1... awe how happy and dumb and innocent we all look. <br><br>The lost days were nothing short of hard and epic. Walked through a 5 hour thunderstorm one day. A whole new level of wet. Trying to warm up at the end of the day in a soaked sleeping bag is fun üòÜ Climbed a million mountains, most notably the Bigelow Mountains, the Horn, and Saddleback Mountain. The best views I've had so far on trail. Got some trail magic one day. Befriended a sweet librarian who let me use their computer after my phone died. Landed on my butt more than once coming down from steep climbs. My legs are a smorgasbord of mud, bruises, and bug bites now. Almost got ridiculously lost one day. But actually had a lot of fun being basically trail blind since my maps are on my phone and not really knowing where I was or how far away anything was. Luckily I'm still passing tons of NOBOs who I can ask for info along the way. I've already met so many amazing people on this trail and now that my feet are finally kinda sorta getting used to the terrain, the insane climbs are getting really fun and the jungle gym/maze of the trail has become a challenging game. <br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #girlswhohike #backpackmaine  #zebratales

We ate, gathered our backpacks, and waited for David, the shuttle driver, to give us to word to go. David dropped us off at the trail head around 8:15 a d we started hiking. <br><br>The 4 miles to the shelter out of Andover were grueling. We went straight up Moody Mountain after we left the parking lot. Next we went straight down into a notch then straight up to Hall Mountain. I was pretty tired because we came out of town prepared for a 6-7 day stretch depending on the weather.<br><br>When we get to the lean-to we find a great tent spot behind it. We set up the tent, have lunch and I nap for a few hours. This was was first nap and it was glorious. I hope to get many more. <br><br>Tomorrow we head to Frye Notch which is 10.5.

We are headed to Andover but we got 2 Mountains in front of us before that. Bemis and Old Blue can be seen looking out from the scenic overlook we passed yesterday. <br><br>We tackle Bemis first. Surging up the mountain in the cool morning we completely pass the summit and don‚Äôt realize it. We start making our way down the mountain before we figure out we had passed it. We stop for a snack and bathroom break.<br><br>Next we tackle Old Blue. Old Blue has a steep 1000 ft climb and 1600 ft descent. We go up and over the mountain pretty swiftly. As we are coming to the top the weather rolls in and it begins to rain. We stop at the summit and call the hostel for our pickup at the road 3 miles away. We didn‚Äôt have a view on Old Blue because of the weather so we head on down. The down is steep in places but it is not fairly easy going until the lat .5 miles to the road. This section is extremely steep and has rebar steps driven into the granite for a secure hold.<br><br>We make it to the road and are picked up by our shuttle. We are staying at Pine Ellis Lodging. The room is in the house which is kind of old and lived in. The owners are very friendly and helpful. David, who picked us up, was very funny and Naomi was sweet and helpful. We are headed back out tomorrow raven though the weather doesn‚Äôt look great. I think it is best that we push forward and not get sucked into a town for a number of days. Our next section will be the toughest yet. Southern Maine, it is almost time.<br><br>#appalachiantrail #appalachiantrail2021 #atclassof2021 #atflipflop2021 #almostsobo #outdoors #outside #trails #hike #backpacking #couplesthatbackpack #withguthook #hailstate #hikertrash #atsobo2021 #mainetogeorgia #nature #photography #travelbyfoot #vlog #blog #hikerofinstagram #couplesthathike #walkthisway #mountains #choosemountains #themountainsarecalling #mcdillsonthemove #maine #mountainview

Neither of us slept very sound last night. We both decide it was because we were both pretty sore from the last few days.<br><br>We break camp from Sabbath headed to Bemis Mountain Lean-to. We start out with a small climb that warms us up. The weather seems nice today. The sky is slightly overcast and the wind  is blowing a slight breeze. We find a small logging road and enjoy our first break of the day.<br><br>After a short break and short conversations with some other hikers going north, we head out. There have not been many views today. Mostly ponds and still waters. I am also always surprised at the number of bogs we pass through. The small bog bridges definitely make a difference, if not for them we would more than likely lose a shoe in the black muck.<br><br>We continued on until reaching Bemis Stream. The water is low so there is no need to take off our shoes. We glide over the rocks and find a small, shaded area to have lunch. <br><br>After lunch we start our climb up Bemis Mountain. The climb is long, steep and rocky. Once we got through the biggest part of the climb we came to a section the had many granite outcrops with little vegetation. We got some great views before arriving at the summit of Bemis Mountain Second, which is a smaller brother to Bemis Mountain.<br><br>We stopped at the Bemis Mountain Lean-to for the evening. We eat and get ready for bed. Tomorrow will be an early day. We will summit Bemis then Old Blue tomorrow and after we will go into Andover to resupply. Only 43.7 miles left in n Maine. <br><br>#appalachiantrail #appalachiantrail2021 #atclassof2021 #atflipflop2021 #almostsobo #outdoors #outside #trails #hike #backpacking #couplesthatbackpack #withguthook #hailstate #hikertrash #atsobo2021 #mainetogeorgia #nature #manofthewoods #travelbyfoot #vlog #blog #hikerofinstagram #couplesthathike #walkthisway #mountains #choosemountains #themountainsarecalling #mcdillsonthemove #maine #mountainview

Yesterday we hiked in the rain and it sucked. Today I am thankful for sunlight. We strike out headed up Saddleback Junior. Despite its name it was not a junior climb. <br><br>We head up and over until we reach the first summit. Saddleback Junior, just like most of the summits here in Maine, is very steep when getting close to the top. Most times when summiting it is so steep it ends up with a short rock scramble. <br><br>The view from the top is great. The sky is a clear with a light blue color. The suns shines across the rest of the valley and we can see the other mountains that we will be crossing today. The Horn and Saddleback are what‚Äôs left.<br><br>We head down from Junior. We maneuver down the many rocks and roots until it flattens out for a short reprieve. We then head back up to the Horn. The Horn is around 3600 feet. What is so cool here is that when you get near the top you break tree line. This is where there is little vegetation and trees. It is mainly a path on rocks for 2.5 miles. In bad weather it could be dangerous but we were blessed with good weather. <br><br>The few miles above tree-line today was some of the most beautiful hiking I have ever. The 360¬∞ views were break-taking. We may our clothes out on the Horn and let everything dry while we have lunch. After that we gather our things and press forward down the ridge and and back up to Saddleback Mountain.<br><br>Saddleback is a 4000 ft mountain and you can definitely feel it on the climb. The climb consist of steep granite slabs m, followed by a rock scramble then a semi flat walk to the summit. The summit is phenomenal. We sit and take in the views then head down to the shelter. <br><br>#appalachiantrail #appalachiantrail2021 #atclassof2021 #atflipflop2021 #almostsobo #outdoors #outside #trails #hike #backpacking #couplesthatbackpack #withguthook #hailstate #hikertrash #atsobo2021 #mainetogeorgia #nature #manofthewoods #travelbyfoot #vlog #blog #hikerofinstagram #couplesthathike #choosemountains #thisistheway #mando #wildflower #mcdillsonthemove #maine #takelessdomore

The next time I wake up it had been raining for an hour and showed no signs of stopping. The rain wasn‚Äôt heavy but it was steady. <br><br>After packing up camp, we sat around and talked about the immense amount of elevation gain and loss we did the day before, almost 10,000 ft combined. We enjoy each other‚Äôs company before the first of us head out. Kaci and I were last to leave. We hiked with ‚ÄúOdd Pole‚Äù most of the day. He is a SOBO we have been hiking around for a few days. At least we got to enjoy the rain with someone else.<br><br>The rain made us slow. We trudged up and down, going over roots and climbing up slabs of granite. The rocks and roots become especially slick after and during rain. It is easy to lose your footing and fall over. Falling over is a lot easier to do since we have packs on. When you get off balance you can‚Äôt stop yourself and you topple over. I fell once yesterday. Kaci fell once today. She jumped back up and was fine  but it makes us a lot more cautious. We eventually get to the shelter and we get spot inside. There are 6 people in the shelter so it should be a fun night. Our clothes and things are hung all around the front opening of the shelter. They probably won‚Äôt dry out all the way but at least they can dry out a little. <br><br>Tomorrow we go over Saddleback. We will have 2.5 miles of exposed trail above tree line. Hopefully we should have a beautiful day.

After going over 2 more peaks we felt like we were doing very well with our time so when we got to our 8 mile mark we decided that we would push further in order to get ahead of the late rain, it made the day a lot bigger and more difficult. <br><br>Up and over 2 more peaks close to 4000 ft make our elevation gain and loss add up to near 9000 feet in change throughout the day. By the time we roll into camp we are tired. I didn‚Äôt film much because of the long mileage today. We eventually get to the campsite in time to beat the weather. Today was a long, hard day but I can‚Äôt wait for tomorrow. <br>‚Ä¢<br>‚Ä¢<br>‚Ä¢<br>#appalachiantrail #appalachiantrail2021 #atclassof2021 #atflipflop2021 #almostsobo #outdoors #outside #trails #hike #backpacking #couplesthatbackpack #withguthook #hailstate #hikertrash #atsobo2021 #mainetogeorgia #nature #manofthewoods #travelbyfoot #vlog #blog #hikerofinstagram #couplesthathike #walkthisway #thisistheway #mando #wildflower #mcdillsonthemove #maine #takelessdomore

We are greeted at the trailhead by our first big trail magic headed south, Stratton‚Äôs Chief of Police a.k.a ‚ÄúBourbon Batman.‚Äù He grills us hotdogs and sausages, tells us hilarious stories, and gives us cold drinks. Us, along with some other hikers enjoy his company until our shuttle arrives to pick us up. Tonight and tomorrow we are staying at the Maine Roadhouse. <br><br>The Main Roadhouse is a recently remodeled, reopened hostile in Stratton, ME. The new owners Jen and Jen were the most accommodating hostel hosts could be. This hostel will, in my opinion, become a place of legend. <br><br>Jen and Jen acquired it from a friend of theirs, Sue. Sue was actually here with us and she was so interesting. She has done a lot of different things from hiking the trail to many business ventures. We had breakfast with Sue and enjoyed her many colorful stories and lively attitude. <br><br>We resupply, relax, and recover to get ready for the next part of the trail. The next section will be as difficult as anything we have done. There is also rain coming in today and tomorrow so it is gonna be a long 2 days going over the mountains soaked in cold rain.

It‚Äôs worth the weight. <br><br>Leap frogging forward to NH/VT AT junction. Intention is too hopefully do all of Vermont and put me in a good spot to then make it to the worlds best dog sitters wedding, @crae_guns, in beginning of August and a preplanned work function with Catamount Consulting that same week. Possible I may continue my push SOBO to Georgia or return to Maine / NH before leap frogging again.

Summiting Mt Madison in 60mph wind gusts and bullet-like wind was probably my favorite hiking I've ever done. I'll do my best to check in again soon, batteries only last so long, and service is always few and far between.

But that meant lots of time lying in my tent and my feet finally got plenty of rest and I hit the trail feeling much better today. The taping technique I used seems to be helping my inflamed Achilles and it's the first day I can walk without thinking about the pain I'm in every second. I have to slow down a lot and walk kinda funny since my ankle is pretty immobilized, but eventually I get the hang of my new stride and make it work. So thankful. The trail always provides. I just had to get knocked down and humbled a bit first. I finally finish the Hundred Mile Wilderness and make it to my first town stop in Monson around 2 PM. The cutest and tiniest town ever. A hostel full of hikers. Real food. A free beer. A much needed shower. So much laughter and trail talk. It's the best. Town days always fly by with all the chores and checking in with people back home to let them know you haven't been eatin by a bear and trying to figure out how to consume as much food as possible in the few hours you have. Smelly gear hanging around everywhere to dry, lines of shoes and backpacks. Everyone munching on their own large pizza and sorting through resupply boxes wearing loaner clothes that are mismatched and two sizes too big. It probably looks like a circus to anyone on the outside, but for hikers this is heaven. <br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #100milewilderness #girlswhohike #backpackmaine&nbsp; #zebratales

Climbing all day. Beyond exhausted. Every time I stopped to catch my breath, my eyes would start to close... wake up I would yell to myself. A guy told me he burned 7000 calories the other day in 15 miles. And that was a day with only one mountain. I don't know how many mountains I did today... 7, 8? I doubt I'm eating more than 3000 calories a day right now, if that. No wonder by body is shutting down. To top it off my left Achilles tendon started bugging me yesterday and today it was on fire. Literally felt like my entire back of my ankle is covered in blisters, except it's not. I spent the whole day trying to figure out how to walk without aggravating it more and also not compensating with my other leg because I know that will only lead to another injury. I have to remind myself that this will pass. The beginning is always the hardest. I'm hiking in new terrain. And putting in big miles with these kind of climbs is not gonna be doable until my body gets used to it. It's so hard for me to slow down, but I'm going to have to force myself to. It's a marathon, not a sprint. Luckily it rained all day to keep it cool and keep the mosquitoes mostly away. Unfortunately it also made the rocks incredibly slippery. So many times I landed on my butt and really did not want to get back up. Tears welled in my eyes a couple times, I can't even remember the last time I cried. Just wondering why it has to be so hard. But it does have to be. Because it wouldn't be worth it if wasn't. Because I came out here knowing this would challenge me in new ways and wanting that. And it is. Took all my energy to make it 17 miles. Laying in my tent, stretching, pretending I'm a physical therapist, experimenting with taping my Achilles, the rain coming down, finally a chance to breathe and relax. Trying not to fall asleep because it's only 6 PM. Cutting out coffee at the beginning of a thru hike might not have been the best idea üòÇ<br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #100milewilderness #girlswhohike #backpackmaine  #zebratales

Who cares. Pack up. Breakfast on the beach. Another peanut butter and whatever crumbly stuff I have tortilla wrap. Second day without coffee. Besides being sick, that's probably my longest streak in years. I miss the jolt, but I'll survive. I don't have a choice. Today I climb. All day. There are no switchbacks here. Straight up and down every mountain. I can't count how many there were today. Sometimes it's actually climbing, pulling yourself up roots and boulders. The sweat is insane. I can't imagine how bad I must smell. Good thing everyone else does too. Finally get a couple views. And can almost see the sun through the haze. It's awesome, but I sure hope every East-coaster gets a chance to see some real west coast mountains someday üòâ Normally I can bust out 10-15 miles before stopping or needing water. Not out here. Every few miles I need water and rest and food. Maybe I'm out of shape. Maybe this just really is the hardest part of the entire Appalachian Trail like everyone says. By the end of the day my feet hurt soooooooo bad. I am so excited to make it to our stealth camping spot beside the river. There are eight others camping here.&nbsp; <br>Some dude makes a fire right behind a no fires sign. He says he didn't see it. You couldn't light this place on fire if you tried. The most time I've spent with others so far on trail. We eat dinner together and talk about our lives and aches and food. Life is good. I make it to 9:30 tonight. Adulting is hard. <br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #100milewilderness #girlswhohike #backpackmaine  #zebratales

And it's too foggy on the lake. Back to bed til my alarm goes off at 6:30. 10 hours of sleep. Guess I'm making up for all the long nights of the past half a year. I'm already hobbling around like an old man first thing in the morning. I was hoping this would at least take a few weeks to start. Nope. My feet hurt so bad. These roots are killing my arches. Definitely an entirely new way of hiking I have to get used to. If you can call it hiking. So much water. Walking around rivers and creeks for miles. Somebody says something about the poor quality of the creeks we are crossing. I can't help but laugh. Don't ever hike in the desert I wanna tell him. But I don't 'cause he's wearing toe socks and almost out of food. It starts raining late morning. It's refreshing. It'll pass I tell myself. It doesn't. I literally can't see it's raining so hard. I misread a sign and end up off trail, but at a shelter. Good excuse to stop. We end up with 8 or so of us there waiting the storm out. Some dude shares his fudge with us. I guess not all NOBOs are bad. Another chick trims the edible mushrooms she found for her meal later. I want to ask her for a lesson in mushroom identification, but I know that's probably a good way to end up dead on trail. I sadly pull myself away from the party when the downpour turns to a sprinkle and push on. I don't have enough food to hang out in shelters all day. I didn't think the miles would be as hard to come by or that I would already have hiker hunger. I try to dry my stuff out at lunch. Things never really dry here. I never knew Maine was such a jungle. I'm destroyed by the time I finish the 25 mile day. I find my hidden food drop that you can pay the hostel to drop off for you since we are in the Hundred Mile Wilderness. It's actually 115 miles. I find another hidden beach to camp at and make a friend, Trail Bait... just the name of someone you wanna be hiking with. She's from Cali and did part of the PCT before having to get off and ending up out here. We joke about hiker hunger and funny New England people. The accents out here are amazing. It's gonna be sad when they die off.

Please go by, please go by... no luck. Ranger pops out and I try and open my sleepy eyes. Sleepy from only 11 hours of sleep. I needed that. Threatens me with a $250 fine. He's a Baxter State Park Ranger. I'm outside his jurisdiction. Camping where I was told I could. I play it nice and innocent 'cause ain't no cop wants to be proven wrong. He "let's me go". Asks me if I have any experience backpacking... üòâ I pack up fast and walk a half a mile down the road where he tells me there is a breakfast joint that opens at 7. Get there at 7:03. Not open til 8 today. Eat my peanut butter, trail mix, pop tart, granola tortilla wrap. Stick around to buy some coffee when the store opens and chat up some NOBOs. Hit the trail on a caffeine high. 8 AM and it's already humid AF. The sweating basically never stops all day. Plank walks over bogs. Freaking roots and rocks everywhere. You don't hike here, you boulder/root hop throughout the trail, staring at the ground nonstop so you don't roll an ankle. Miles don't come easy. Nothing does. Mosquitos are relentless. Flies in my eyes. Go off trail for lunch just so I can jump in a cold lake. So worth it. Saw a moose. Tripped trying to get a picture and scared him. Didn't stick around for the pic. 23 miles into the day I find a sandy beach to stealth camp on. Feels like the hardest 23 miles of my life. How can my feet hurt so bad?

But I guess I was too excited for that. Finally crawled out of my hostel bed at 5 AM, whispered with the other hikers who were up and ready, ate a frozen breakfast sandwich, shuttle to Baxter State Park, Ranger briefed us on climbing Katadhin. In other words he told us it was supposed to thunderstorm and noone was coming up for us if we called. Sweet. Practically ran up the mountain I was so excited. So much fun scrambling up the rock faces, like a giant scavenger hunt trying to find the white blazes on the rocks. Rebar in some of the rocks to pull yourself up. Wind blowing like crazy. Almost blew me off a cliff or two. Pure adrenaline. Trail flattens out and I am finally not huffing and puffing and am instantly freezing from being covered in sweat and oh yea, rain. Left Cali at 115¬∞and fires everywhere. And it's raining here. Make it to the top. Couple pics, protein bar shoved in the mouth. Can't see a thing as I gaze out from the northern&nbsp; terminus, what should be an epic view. Five minutes later heading back down. Soaked. Ecstatic. Pass tons of hikers who turned back. This climb is no joke. Especially in a storm. Make it back to the ranger station, where I have a reservation to camp because you have to. But I feel good so I push on. 10 miles later my feet hurt like a mother and I collapse when I finally get out of the state park boundaries, where camping is allowed. I lie on the wet ground, I'm soaked in sweat and rain anyways. Set up my tent, try to stretch, eat, sip the mini whiskey bottle I forgot I had brought to drink on top of Katahdin. When you're exhausted and dehydrated whiskey is anything but refreshing. But it does help to fall asleep by 8:30 and sleep soundly for most of the night.<br><br>#at #appalachiantrail #atsobo #atsobo2021 #sobolife #ulbackpacking #100milewilderness #girlswhohike #backpackmaine  #zebratales

Monson to Stratton, Maine. This section took us over more roots and rocks, through river fords and lush alpine forests.

Luckily we had Maggie the golden retriever to help us navigate.<br><br>We also had our first taste of what is to come - 4000+ footers. We climbed the Bigelows, with the Avery and West Peaks above 4000, surrounded by clouds, a precious alpine zone with wild blueberries on the summit.<br><br>For the next 2-3 weeks we'll be going through southern Maine and into New Hampshire, with many many mountains over 4000 foot, sometimes more than one a day (for UK folks, this is higher then Scafell or Snowdon, daily).

Everyone at camp was moving about the same pace too. We all know we have a hard day in front of us. Today we are going into the Bigelow Range and that means summiting 4 peaks: Little Bigelow, Avery Peak, West Bigelow, and South Horn. <br><br>Little Bigelow was relatively easy. We stayed half way up the climb last night at the lean-to so it eased a little of the burden. Upon Little Bigelow we see the two 4000 ft mountains that we will have to cross, Avery Peak and West Bigelow. <br> <br>The climb up Avery is strenuous and slow. The trail seems to go straight up at times and we have to maneuver around huge boulders and roots. The climb is worth the energy because at the top we get a 360¬∞ view of the surrounding landscape. It is absolutely beautiful and mesmerizing. We eat lunch at the top and continue on.<br><br>West Bigelow was not as much of a climb but it still had a beautiful summit with breathtaking views. We crossed over West Bigelow then headed down the ridge. The wind was blowing us back and forth on the open summit. We eventually made it down and started our ascent up South Horn. <br><br>South Horn was kind of gentle until about .3 from the summit, then it got steep. We crested the Horn and were able to see the shelter .5 miles down. We headed down to the shelter as fast as our sore feet could carry us. <br><br>We made it to the shelter and got a really nice camp spot. We even have service tonight so we plan to try and post a little I think.<br><br>#appalachiantrail #appalachiantrail2021 #atclassof2021 #atflipflop2021 #almostsobo #outdooors #outside #trails #hike #backpacking #couplesthatbackpack #withguthook #hailstate #hikertrash #atsobo2021 #mainetogeorgia #nature #manofthewoods #travelbyfoot #vlog #blog #hikerofinstagram #couplesthathike #walkthisway #thisistheway #mando #wildflower #mcdillsonthemove #maine

Most of the time 4th of July is spent with family and friends eating grilled food and splashing in a pool. We could swim though, it would just be it colder.<br><br>The morning hike has been good. A few ascents and descents followed by flat terrain. We stopped for lunch at Flagstaff Campsite. There is a beach here but it is a little chilly to swim. We are only going a few miles further and then chill for the day. We are resting up for our new few days, which will be pretty tough.<br><br>We got to camp early today because of the low mileage day. We built a fire and stayed warm. There are a number of other SOBO hikers at the lean-to so we decided to tent camp. I cooked early and we are in bed early because we want to get up really early to start hiking.<br><br>Last night we heard fireworks and I am hoping to hear them again. It hasn‚Äôt seemed like it was a holiday today, it just felt like another day of hiking. We head to Stratton in the few days and we have to find somewhere to stay. We don‚Äôt want to spend a huge amount of money at a hostel so we are weighing our options. We will have to decide by tomorrow. Anyways, Bigelows here we come.<br><br>#appalachiantrail #appalachiantrail2021 #atclassof2021 #atflipflop2021 #almostsobo #outdooors #outside #trails #hike #backpacking #couplesthatbackpack #withguthook #hailstate #hikertrash #atsobo2021 #mainetogeorgia #nature #manofthewoods #travelbyfoot #vlog #blog #hikerofinstagram #couplesthathike #walkthisway #thisistheway #mando #wildflower #mcdillsonthemove #maine

Don't get us wrong - very much looking forward to daily ramen and oreo cookies.

Nutritional yeast (all the above from @harmonyhousefoods )<br>4. Soy milk powder (@outdoorherbivore )<br>5. A mix to put in our oats every morning made from chia, flax, coconut and cinnamon<br>5. Sriracha (@sriracha2go ) üå∂Ô∏è<br>6. Veg stock cubes<br>7. Multivit and B vit<br><br>We plan to use this constant baseline source of iron, protein, vitamins and omegas to supplement whatever grains and pulses we can buy en route (and nutter butters and oreos and all the crisps...). Luckily we have had a chance to develop some recipes while hiking in Scotland the last two years üòä<br><br>Other things can go in these base boxes as needed (extra clothes, meds, etc) which Cait had way too much fun organising into an Excel spreadsheet ü§ì<br><br>We may change how we do things as we go, but we have this as a security blanket.

Over the past few years, I‚Äôve strayed away from my roots. I feel lost.<br><br>For the past few years I‚Äôve been a registered nurse in Orlando, FL. I picked up a travel nursing assignment in Roanoke, VA because I felt overwhelming stress and like I did not belong in that city. I felt like a sore thumb.<br><br>For some reason, I feel a hole in the soul. I‚Äôve tried everything under the sun to fill this ‚Äòhole in the soul‚Äô and I‚Äôm finally in a spot to do some serious soul searching. I want to go off the grid and feel more connected with nature. I want to find a deeper meaning and fulfillment within myself. For some reason, I feel this is perfect. I have a spot of financial stability to take time off & travel alone. <br><br>When I think of the times I felt the most free, I think of running in the fields in my hometown. And being in the woods. Nothing but a fire, a sleeping bag, and the river. Camping. These are the memories I love the most and long to create more of. When I was stressed as a child, I ran off and put up a hammock in the woods and spent the night there. <br><br> I hope this journey can help me find my peace, and bring me back to a place where I feel belonging and understanding of who I am supposed to be. <br><br> #AT2021 #atsobo2021 #appalachiantrailsouthbound #appalachiantrail #athiker #atsouthbound #mainetogeorgia #walkaboutoutfitter #appalachiantrail2021 #southboundat #soboappalachianhiker #athiker2021 #2021at #hiker #appalachianmountains
