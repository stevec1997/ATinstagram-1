As the memories fade from the mind, we find ourselves reminiscing with each other, combing through old images, and reaching out to friends made along the way so as not to forget what a wonderful adventure we had and the wisdom we took from our walk in the woods. While nothing compares to the actual experience of living it, it has been awesome to watch as this next crop of hopeful hikers embarks from the arch at Amicalola Falls in Georgia, many not understanding how much this experience will enrich their lives. We are so excited (and yes, jealous) of their respective journeys through forests, fields, and self.<br><br>And as we discuss how grateful we are for the opportunity to walk through this magnificent country of ours, we are reminded that choosing to do so opened our eyes to the shared experience of being human. The trail taught us to forego judgement, embrace each other, live with love, and to lead with curiosity rather than caution.<br><br>This sentiment - dangerously underrepresented in most of what we see and hear nowadays - is captured eloquently (of course) in a few stanzas of Maya Angelou's poem, Human Family:<br><br>I note the obvious differences<br>between each sort and type,<br>but we are more alike, my friends,<br>than we are unalike.<br><br>We are more alike, my friends,<br>than we are unalike.<br><br>We are more alike, my friends,<br>than we are unalike.<br><br>Good luck to the AT class of 2020! We hope your faith in humanity is restored in the ways that ours was.<br><br>#appalachiantrail #atnobo2019 #at2020 #thruhikers #longdistancehiking

Word of advice: do not eat it, even if a strange man tells you to! <br>I have recently returned to my pile of unfinished blog posts from the trail, and the first one took me right back to probably the scariest moment on the whole AT when we mistook this plant for a ramp. I have never been so sick in my life and I can tell you it's not fun to realize you've eaten a potentially poisonous plant when you're stranded in the middle of nowhere in the mountains.

I use my headlamp at night when I need to walk through the house. Fanny pack - all day, everyday. Tevas when it‚Äôs not super cold. I use my MSR PocketRocket 2 stove when I need water for oatmeal, tea, or to reheat something - so essentially everyday. I found myself extremely impatient when trying I use my electric stove top to boil water because on trail it took only a minute or so, rather than ten. I continue to think in ‚Äúwhat ifs‚Äù - ‚Äúwhat if it rains today‚Äù ‚Äúwhat if my phone dies‚Äù so I act on them and carry my rain jacket because my puffy is down. I bring the portable charger. I accidentally call close friends by my tramily‚Äôs trail names. On the very short hike I‚Äôve done, I had the urge to fully pack up everything. Make sure I had my sawyer, food, and water.

Then we return to what most refer to as "real life" ... But we only know it as a made-up game. A counterfeit. A placebo. Life isn't meant to be lived on nights and weekends. We are going to plan our next LASH on the AT again soon. We have unfinished business, and hearts that can no longer be satisfied by the life we left behind on 2/18/19 before the arch. It's true that the trail will ruin you. But we wouldn't trade it for anything. When people ask us I'd we would do it again, our answer is "yes. I'd be there tommorow if I had the money for it today." .<br>What adventures have you all planned to keep your head above water?<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #appalachianthruhike #atclassof2019 #atnobo #atnobo2019 #thruhike #optoutside #hikerhunger #hikertrash #appalachiantrail2019 #hikerfeed #grief #posttraildepression

I crushed some miles. I was bored. Anticipating to come upon a shelter at any moment, it didn‚Äôt happen. My tramily would not be at this imaginary shelter. No bears. One deer. Three squirrels. I cried for the AT on the FCT as I hiked in the cold. I made oatmeal on a picnic table at a small open pavilion. Waiting for other hikers to show up. They never came. It doesn‚Äôt feel right to hike anywhere else. Like I‚Äôm betraying the AT or something haha. Oh well. Nothing compares to the AT and what it has done for me and others. I miss it daily.

Some view their hike as a feat of extreme athleticism, pushing their bodies to the limit to set the fastest known times. Others meander about, peeking inside flowers and moving snails out of foot traffic (I may have been the latter). One of these fellas traveled my arm for ~3 miles in Tennessee, gently rasping away. In these long days in the forests, I really came to appreciate their fluidity and expressions. .<br>.<br>These are portraits of some of the slowest hikers I ever encountered in the early mornings pacing across southern Appalachia.

From left to right, Choo-Choo, Grandma, Ramblin' Man, and Chilly.  I am so grateful for these people, forever indebted to the trail for bringing us together. <br>Remember when you were a kid and could just ask another kid at the park "hey, wanna be friends?" and then you were.  That's pretty much what happened here, only it was more like "hey, we're going to Katahdin, wanna come with us?" and then we did.  We shared a journey that made a few months of friendship seem like a lifetime.  Nights of infectious laughter in shelters, lots of poop stories, hours of food discussion, intellectual conversations about the hierarchy of wild ponies and the existence of wild chickens, cat pictures, cat shirts, cat purses, cold beers, safety meetings, LOTS of safety meetings, split britches, split elbows, split knees, tears of happiness, tears when we hurt, tears when the trail was so hard that continuing seemed impossible, tears when we missed our families, tears when bad things happened at home, and since 3 of us are chicks, sometimes tears for no damn reason (sorry Ramblin' Man), stinky hugs when needed, long mornings gabbing over coffee that lead to sketchy night hikes, long talks about what's next in the real world, talks of future adventures, debating when the feeling would return to our big toes, guthooks quotes, privy ratings, sleepovers in strangers homes, freezing cold hitches in the back of pickup trucks, watching a taco bell turn to chaos after we ordered a ridiculous amount of food, bus rides, cult experiences, we shared it all.  I couldn't imagine doing the trail without this tramily.  Thanks for coming to Katahdin with me. üé∂Thank you for being a friend.üé∂ #atnobo2019 #thruhike #appalachiantrail #tramily

I thought my 1st week home would be more relaxing, but instead I was overwhelmed with building my life back home.<br><br>Before I thru-hiked the trail, I lived in Korea for 3 years. Anything that wasn't sentimental pretty much got donated or sold. As much as I don't mind cooking in my titanium mug, it's much easier and time efficient to cook meals on my stove. Which meant getting pots/pans/dishes/etc. Gathering things like this took up most of my week. Thanks to the friends that helped me by giving me things they didn't need anymore. üôÇ<br><br>Getting internet in my apartment. Figuring out my electricity bill. Changing my address. All that stuff was next. <br>Having a library card. üôÇ One of the best things. The stack of books ended up being nearly 3 feet tall after all the other books arrived at the library after I requested them. Finally finding time to read some of them today.<br><br>Meeting up with friends. It's weird to have no one call me by my trail name. It's also awkward sometimes. I've been gone too long, it seems, with some friends. With others, it's been like I've never left. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è But it's great to see familiar faces and share hiking stories. üòä<br><br>Last but not least, today I picked up my new bicycle! This is essentially my car. So excited to have wheels again! üòÄüíú Pics:<br>1. New bicycle! <br>2. Unpacking my tubs and getting rid of stuff I didn't need, and gathering stuff that I did. I didn't get rid of much since at least 2 tubs were 70-80% sentimental things.<br>3. Library books stack. This is about half of them. üòÇüíú

It's beautiful weather outside, and I hope the sun melts all the snow/ice on the peak from the previous day.<br>‚Ä¢<br>Since yesterday had crappy weather, and tomorrow is also supposed to be crappy, there's quite a few thru hikers summiting today. üôÇ<br>‚Ä¢<br>The 1st two miles are fairly easy. The trees protect us from the biting wind. As we climb towards treeline, patches of snow appear. It hasn't melted yet. üòï<br>‚Ä¢<br>Then the hardest 0.7 part begins. This is where poles are useless. You're scrambling up huge boulders. I'm grateful to hike with others and we help each other on the sketchy parts; especially as we climb higher and hit more snow/ice covered terrain. ‚Ä¢<br>Then we're done and on the plateau! By this time, I'm hiking alone somehow. There's so many people ahead of me in the distance and others behind. Everything is covered in an inch of snow. Patches of ice litter the trail. Sometimes I can't make it out clearly, but thankfully there's rock cairns.<br>‚Ä¢<br>As I hike closer to the peak, I hear whoops of joy echoing down. Thru hikers ahead are summiting and celebrating. On my way up a group shouts my name and congrats. ‚Ä¢<br>Then I see it. The sign. I fight hard to not become a sobbing mess. I hike up, zeroed in on the sign. I want to touch it immediately, but there are hikers taking photos. As soon as they step away, I reach out and just like that, I'm done. I've hiked the whole AT. ‚Ä¢<br>During this, every thru hiker that recognizes me is cheering. Day hikers are saying congrats. Aware that others are waiting for pictures, I step away and find my friends. I sit for a bit. It doesn't seem real.<br>‚Ä¢ <br>Then I get in line for my summit pic. Strangers help take my picture. More cheering. After, I head back to my friends and eat. We all cheer on thru hikers we see coming up the mountain. There's so many people! It's constant happiness all around between all the groups of hikers.<br>‚Ä¢<br>Soon it's nearly 1pm and time to head down. Two Dinners, Busta Clymbs, and I chose Abol due to the snow. We're down by 4pm. Then that's it. I'm officially done hiking the AT. üòÄüòïüòÄüò≠ü•≥üòÄ

Eventually we do and hike the 10 miles to the Birches in Baxter State Park. ‚Ä¢<br>A brief road walk and AT trail section brings me to a little bridge over a stream. There's a bright red line painted halfway through the bridge, marking the park's boundary. Soon after is the kiosk where thru hikers sign up for one of the 12 spots at the Birches. The park rules are also listed. After barely having any on the AT, it's odd to have so many to remember and follow. ‚Ä¢<br>Then I'm off. I hike down a really flat, nice trail for a bit. Eventually I come to a large stream that we have to rock hop or ford. After looking at the strength of the current and the ridiculous spacing between some of the rain soaked boulders, I decide to take the high water bypass for safety reasons. My worry is that I'll fall and get soaked. It's way too cold to have wet clothes of any kind.<br>‚Ä¢<br>In no time, it seems, I've completed the 10 miles. I tracked down a ranger and check in. Baxter keeps track of everyone entering and leaving the park with yellow paper slips. I'm asked detailed questions about the trails I'll take to summit and come back down, how I'm leaving the park, where I'm staying in the park, etc. Eventually I get my last thru hiker number and the ranger sends me off to the Birches. ‚Ä¢<br>I find the lean-tos and am the first person in camp. I set up my stuff in the shelter and eat lunch. I pull out my yellow plastic card that was handed back to me with my yellow paper slip. On the card, I'm officially thru hiker #1033. At Amicalola Falls, I was #2371. It's insane to me. Out of all the people that registered at Amicalola Falls, over half haven't made it this far yet. I'm sure the number is higher since not everyone registers at Amicalola when they start, and just begin right at Springer Mt. ‚Ä¢<br>The rest of the group trickles in. We start our camp chores and our last campfire. We all reminisce about the trail. There's a happy family reunion between a hiker and his parents. It was beautiful to witness. They also bring trail magic. üôÇ Soon it's time to turn in, sleepy, but excited for tomorrow.

For me, it's soda. üòÇ<br>‚Ä¢<br>We both speed down the trail towards our goal. On top of Rainbow Ledges, a group of us take a break to connect with the "outside world". This is one of the last places we'll have stable cell phone signal until the Katahdin summit. We're all updating family and friends, or messing around on the internet. ‚Ä¢<br>As I hike closer to the campground, I'm a ball of emotions. Happy, sad, excited, briefly mad (tripping over roots), pondering, aware, zoned out, etc. They all cycle through in a loop. ‚Ä¢<br>Soon I'm at the SOBO sign for the 100 Mile Wilderness. I'm done! Woot! About 15 min later, I start to cross a bridge and look to my left. üòÆüòÆüòÆ Katahdin looms in the background. It's so big, and seemingly, RIGHT THERE. It's so close.<br>‚Ä¢<br>Then soda! All the soda. A group of us buy our snacks and drinks, and chat outside. Some have reservations at campgrounds in Baxter State Park and move on to finish the last 10 miles to Katahdin base camp. Two Dinners and I head to our campsite near the store. We have a great view of Katahdin. üôÇ<br>‚Ä¢<br>While we wait for Two Dinners' family, we collect firewood and set up camp a bit. We also find two more hiking friends and invite them back to camp with us. Eventually Two Dinners' family arrives and there's a happy reunion. ‚Ä¢<br>We soon all settle in and start a fire. Around dinner, we chat about the trail and life afterwards. Later, we celebrate a bit, and stay up "late". It isn't until 9pm that we all head to bed.

There were other lakes and such, but again, I wanted to keep moving. ‚Ä¢<br>Because of this weather, I can't wait to finish the trail and get back home. In this moment, I'm just over it. I start to fantasize about constant access to hot showers and the food I'll eat. The books I'll read. Planning for my next adventure.<br>‚Ä¢<br>Eventually I get to camp and set up. I'm so cold that I'm in bed by 610 pm. Once I'm wrapped up in my sleeping quilt, I'm nice and toasty. I only leave my tent to give Two Dinners my leftover pizza and to visit the privy.

About a half our later, I get picked up with a couple of section hikers who are done with their trip. We speed off across the water. It's fun, but cold. I'm glad when we arrive at the hostel. After a nice, scalding shower, I feel better. Next is dinner, and I choose the homemade pizza. It's awesome. It's also so big that I have plenty of leftovers for the next day. üòÄ<br>‚Ä¢<br>After, we all head back to the bunkhouse and relax by the woodstove. It's neat to see this place in action. It's all off grid. The lights and electrical devices (think fridge) are all powered by propane. The bathrooms are privies. The heat is powered by wood stoves.

It is massive! Even more so as it rises up from the flatlands surrounding the base. I can't help smiling, knowing I'll summit the mountain in a few days or so.<br>‚Ä¢<br>The morning starts off cold and slightly grumpy. Two Dinners and I have to ford a river. We take off our socks and shoes, and switch into our camp shoes. The water only comes up to ankle deep or mid calf, but it. was. brutal. The stinging cold instantly, but painfully, numbs our feet and legs. Once we get to the shore, we scramble to get our socks and shoes back on. It takes hours for them to warm back up. After seeing all the trail maintenance along the AT, I'm continually wondering why Maine seems to have no bridges. Hopefully this is one of the last places I'll have to ford.<br>‚Ä¢<br>Today we also climb the last of the major mountains before Katahdin. The weather is beautiful today, and the sky clear. I see Katahdin for the 1st time. A mix of emotions pass through, but mostly I'm excited.<br>‚Ä¢<br>During lunch break, I realize I'm doing great on dinner food, but am low on snacks and lunch food. I decide to make a reservation at Whitehouse Landing for the next day. I'll be able to get dinner, breakfast, and a small resupply there to hold me over until the camp store at Abol Bridge/Pines Campground. This settles my mind and my hunger. Until then, I'd been rationing my food. Now I don't have to, and I just sit and eat. üôÇüòÇ<br>‚Ä¢<br>Not too much else happened during the rest of my hike that day. However, at camp, Two Dinners and I had a small surprise. The past two days, we have seen no other NOBO hikers. We know who is around 5 miles ahead and behind us because we left town at the same time. But we haven't seen anyone else. At all. ‚Ä¢<br>However, when we get to the shelter for the night, there's around 8 to 10 hikers there. Hikers that we didn't leave town with. We're surprised at how many there are. It's strange to see nobody and then hit a small group like that. üòÇ After chatting for a bit, it sounded like this group was taking their time through the 100 Mile to savor the last week or so on trail. üôÇ<br>‚Ä¢<br>Pics:<br>1&2.

It's true that there aren't any stores/towns for the next 100 miles, but there's still ways to get food/supplies thanks to logging roads. Shaws and the AT Lodge will do food drops. There's  a hostel gonna lake in the 100 Mile. There's also cell reception as soon as you're high enough up, in case you need to call out for something. ‚Ä¢<br>Today was good terrain overall. I see a cool waterfall along the way. I'm least excited about fording a knee high river. I take off my shoes and roll up my pants. It's cold outside already. The water even more so.

I stay there for a bit and watch them work.<br>‚Ä¢<br>Somewhere along the way, I run into Two Dinners. It's getting late and we decide to stealth camp together next to a stream. Other than the two hikers I started out with in the morning, I haven't seen a single other NOBO hiker all day. I thought I would have to camp alone, but am relieved that I won't. I still haven't gotten over my reluctance to stealth camp by myself, and am grateful to have a friend nearby. ‚Ä¢<br>We do our camp chores and chat as we eat. Soon it's hiker midnight, and we're off to bed. The stream soothes us to sleep. Not a bad way to begin the 100 Mile. üòä<br>‚Ä¢<br>1-3: 100 Mile Wilderness! Last major milestone before Katahdin.

We'll definitely keep in touch, but this is the last time I'll see them in person. I wish them the best of luck on their summit in a few days or so.<br>‚Ä¢<br>After breakfast, I stop by the ATC headquarters in Monson, and the lady there shares a wealth of information about Katahdin and Baxter State Park.

Later on, her info becomes invaluable when planning for my summit day.<br>‚Ä¢<br>Once I get my resupply and town chores done, I hang out at the hostel. Then something magical happens.

Jumping out of the truck is a friend I've been trying to catch up to this entire time on trail.<br>‚Ä¢<br>Giggles and I started our friendship here on IG before we started the trail.

But here we were, finally meeting each other in person. üòÄ It was great. ‚Ä¢<br>We chat for a bit before she has to go. She was only stopping by for a bit to pass a message onto another hiker.

They're at least a day ahead of me, and I'm planning to zero the next day.<br>‚Ä¢<br>I get in, get my new shoes, and settle in. Later that night we all have dinner. So much laughter. I know I'll still see them the next morning at breakfast, but I'm highly aware, at dinner, of how much I'll miss our banter and camaraderie. These moments, with my trail friends, are some of my favorite memories from my journey. üôÇ<br>‚Ä¢<br>Pics:<br>1-4: Trail and views on the Bald Mountain area. Love all the reds and oranges in the foliage.

When I woke up this morning I had no intentions of heading into Caratunk since I wouldn't make it to the Kennebec River in time for the ferry. However, my plans completely changed mid-day once Chef ran into me on trail. He had scheduled a ferry with a local woman at 530pm. Thankfully he let me know about and we agreed to split the cost. I zoomed the rest of the day.<br>‚Ä¢<br>Before this all happened, I was taking my time hiking the trail. My day started off with this beautiful pond and its mirror image. üòç<br>‚Ä¢<br>The trail was super flat compared to the day before. Wide and beautiful. Loved zooming on it. Also saw a few waterfalls. üòÄ<br>‚Ä¢<br>I didn't get any pics or vids of the ferry crossing. I was too busy holding onto the sides as I sat in the middle. A minor regret.

The weather in the valley is great. Sunny. Warm. I'm optimistic that the Bigelow range will have good weather, too, despite the forecasted rain and higher elevation. ‚Ä¢<br>The climb up to the ridge isn't too bad, but the weather is significantly colder. As I climb, I can see that Bigelow Mt is surrounded in clouds. It's also getting windy. I put on more layers.<br>‚Ä¢<br>I reach the summit, and eventhough it's in a cloud, the alpine foliage is beautiful. A few views peek out from under the fog. As I hike towards Bigelow Avery peak, the clouds begin to fade. I'm in awe of how stunning the fall colors look on the landscape below. So beautiful. ‚Ä¢<br>As I head down Little Bigelow, I'm elated to finish my last 4k until Katahdin. I'm also exhausted from the 15 mile day. I can't seem to stop yawning, and laying down in the middle of the trail for a nap keeps popping up in my mind. Eventually I make it all the way down and into camp.

It's amazing to see the contrast of these two vastly different lives so plainly- one where you need to make money and everything you do outside of that just gets squeezed in where it can, and another where there's nothing but open space and time to BE and to LIVE. On the trail, there was nothing holding you back from experiencing everything in life that is truly important. Being present, self-care, working hard toward something you really care about (because it wasn't imposed on you... YOU CHOSE IT), quality human interaction, exercise, the wellness of yourself and the people around you, joy. But in society, we spend most of our time thinking about where we need to be and when, what needs to get done, how much money we need to make and how, how to limit our spending so we can survive, politics and  updating licenses and paying things by their due dates and simply just keeping our heads above water. And we try to squeeze the important things into the margins. I know why people are happier on the trail. Because the trail is real life. This? It's just a game we made up. It's time for a perspective shift. I can't try to force trail life into my civilized life. And I can't jump into society as I knew it before the trail- because I am different now. But I CAN color my current life with what I learned on the AT. I know how to embrace suck. I know how to be happy with what I have. I know how to measure success by my personal best and not the best of the person next to me. I know how to shine when it's raining. I know how to push when I'm tired. I know how to see beauty where it lies. I can do this. You can do this. .<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #appalachianthruhike #atclassof2019 #atnobo #atnobo2019 #thruhike #optoutside #hikerhunger #hikertrash #appalachiantrail2019 #hikerfeed #posttraillife #posttraildepression

Ive been doing allot of reflecting on these past 5 1/2 months. The day to day grind of every morning packing everything you own into a backpack. Brushing your teeth. Going number one or number two before you push on. Attaching the backpack to yourself as if it was an extension of your body. And beginning to walk for whatever amount of miles you have predetermined the night before. Finally getting to camp. Setting up your tent and making your home for the night. Dinner was always the highlight of the day.<br>Allot of people have been asking me what I thought of the whole experience. I tell them it was definitely harder than I thought but worth it. Some days you had really high highs then the next day you had really low lows. Like being on top of Mt. Washington on a beautiful sunny afternoon then having 4 days of none stop rain. Everyday there was something new. Watching loons on the lake, reaching an epic view, having chipmunks run right in front of ya. But what really set this trail apart was meeting so many new people with the same mind set as you. Recent college grads looking to get away before they continue on with their career. Recently retired men and woman looking to get that check mark on the bucket list. Then there were the people using the trail to help them with where they wanted to go next. To use the 5-6 months to think and to grow. Each person had their own story and reason and it was awesome to run into so many hikers and listen.<br>Would i do it again? In a heartbeat. Will i be doing any of the other long trails in the states? At some point. Do i have any regrets? Not one.<br>I want to thank each and every one of you for being so supportive and awesome these past 6 months. Your words of wisdom and encouragement did not go unnoticed. To all the people that contacted me to get together but couldn‚Äôt make it work. I apologize. Trying to plan anything while on trail is a pain in the butt. I hope we see each other again soon. To everyone that helped out with resupply packages, shuttles, hotels all that great stuff. I thank you. I want to thank my awesome grandparents for all the love and support they've

In the valleys, the weather is sunny and warm, but on the mountain peaks, it's windy and cold. The peaks are surrounded in clouds. The terrain on tallest Saddleback is often foggy and dreary. But the other peaks are shorter, and the clouds clear from them as the day goes on<br>‚Ä¢<br>I think fall is showing on the alpine peaks. The grasses are turning a yellow hue and some of the bushes leaves are a nice burgundy. I love how it looks.<br>‚Ä¢<br>I push myself hard today. I'm determined to complete the 18 miles that I'd planned to hike. I succeed! Finally! I can start getting some big mile days in again. üòÄ<br>‚Ä¢<br>Pics<br>1. The Horn<br>2&3.

I pass a lot of ponds along the way, but only snap photos at this one. I'm determined to get into town asap.<br>‚Ä¢<br>I make my plans/reservations on the fly as I hike. Maine is definitely a more plan ahead state mainly because the road crossings, so far, have limited to no cell reception. The cell reception is on top of mountains. üòÇ<br>‚Ä¢<br>On my way down one of the mountains, I hit a trail jam. A flock of grouse are on trail eating. I don't want to scare them so I slow down. They are 100% not scared of me and I walk with them as I pass by, literally a foot or less away from me. It was a fun experience. ‚Ä¢<br>I made plans to meet up with Lighthouse and Turbo for lunch. It's great to see my friends on trail. We catch up about what has happened since we last saw each other. üôÇ<br>Then hike to the road together. ‚Ä¢<br>At the road is my stop for the day. It's blocked off by police. There's a bad motorcycle accident that they're cleaning up. I had a shuttle coming in an hour, but cancel it when a day hiker couple, who were trapped in the parking lot, offer me a ride back into town. The police wave us through. Soon I've collected my soda/fresh fruit and am happily lounging in my hotel room. üòÄ<br>‚Ä¢<br>Pics<br>1&2. Pond across from Sabbath Day Lean-to <br>3&4. One with the grouse. üòÇüíú

I'm also frustrated that I've hiked another "short" day.<br>‚Ä¢<br>Despite my body warning me that it's overworked and tired, the day is still fun. I've been hiking/camping around new hikers everyday, but recently my schedule has matched with Frizz and her tramily. I really enjoy everyone's company and camping with them. We took a snack break together on top of one of the mountains earlier that day. It's one of my favorite memories. üôÇ

The lure of soda and a warm bed was too strong. It was an easy decision to head back to the hostel.<br>‚Ä¢<br>While I was on Moody Mt, though, I took a few moments to enjoy the view and document it. It's hard to see in the pic/vid, but the dusting of orange in the horizon is more prominent each day. Soon the fall colors will be in full "bloom". I can't wait. üôÇ

The colors are so brilliant as they filter through the trees. I don't edit/filter any of my pics; that's truly how the sunrise looked that morning. üòç<br>‚Ä¢<br>My body feels a bit beat up from the Whites and southern Maine. I'm hoping the short day will help heal it up a bit. I'm also curious about this building after hearing about it from other hikers.<br>‚Ä¢<br>I arrive to the road in time and eventually settle in to the hostel. While catching up on posts in here, May May the Yorkie insists I play with her. I happily oblige. Later, the pug puppy, Eb, also wants to play. I couldn't be happier just sitting on the floor and play fetch or tug with the dogs. üòä<br>‚Ä¢<br>The night is rounded out with dinner at a local restaurant.

I woke up crawling out of my skin with anticipation, my two sheltermates still sleeping beside me. I forced myself to take the time to eat breakfast, knowing the climb would be slippery and long. I took my time packing up, but the instant my pack was on my back I shot for the summit. I heaved up the trail, chugging like some rogue train with the engineer asleep at the wheel, no brakes, barreling up a single track to a lone point in the distance. I hit the exposed boulder field, turned my head around as the trees fell away, and my breath caught in my throat‚Äî ‚ÄúWhoa,‚Äù I said to the mountain. Nobody else around but me and her. Wisps of cloud swirled over the expansive landscape and around a peak I was headed for but couldn‚Äôt see. I pushed on, ready for the hardest bouldering climb of the last five months. I‚Äôd look at a curl of rebar or an expanse of boulder and think "how the hell am I supposed to‚Äî‚Äú but before I could finish the thought my body had already taken care of it and I'd be looking back at the obstacle. It took care of me, and the mountain took care of me, and we made our way up, up, until with a whoop and a holler I was the second thru hiker to the top of Mama Katahdin, September 3, 2019.<br><br>How true it felt that we earned our climb. 141 days of preparation to commune with her. What a gift to summit such a wild, beautiful beast at the end of this long pilgrimage.<br>.<br>üìçAncestral lands of the Wabanaki Confederation. Wabanaki means ‚ÄòPeople of the First Light‚Äô. Every year tribal members make a pilgrimage up Katahdin that traces their ancestors‚Äîancestors who were forced from the land that we now call Baxter State Park. The ceremony is a temporary reclaiming of the wilderness that was once their home.

I put my poles away and spider my way through the boulders the best I can. Some parts you have to take off your pack and push or pull it up under boulders.<br>‚Ä¢<br>I'm totally wiped out after I finish the notch, and camp at a stealth site after it with a small group of hikers. I don't have the strength or patience to tackle Mahoosuc Arm. That's tomorrow's adventure. It was nice to get into camp a bit early, sit by the campfire, and chat about the day.

It's too dangerous to hike Mt Washington in it and it's supposed to be good weather the next day.

He's been taking his time and enjoying the trail, so he decided to flip up to Maine after finishing CT to make sure he doesn't run out of time before Katahdin closes in about a month.

Spent the last two days on some pretty flat trail. We‚Äôve been hiking along some beautiful rivers, streams and lakes. <br>Ended up at Moxie Bald Lean-to last night, which was right in front of Bald Mountain Pond. Heard there was a few moose sightings at this spot but never got to see one. The loons were definitely out that night. Stayed in the Lean-to with a couple from germany, the dude snored ALL night üôÑ. Woke up the next morning and made coffee and breakfast on the beach, was hoping to catch a moose. The weather was a bit chilly, probably in the lower 40‚Äôs but curled up in the sleeping bag it‚Äôs real nice. Had about 15 miles until Monson, ME and is the last stop before the ‚Äú100 mile wilderness‚Äù. It is the longest stretch on the AT with no access to roads or resupply. So you have to prepare for atleast a 5-6 day food ration, which can get pretty heavy. Once i hit Millinocket, Me that will be the northern point of the ‚Äú100 mile wilderness‚Äù and 15 miles from Katahdin üò≥ü§©. Probably won‚Äôt have service the whole time so I‚Äôll do an update when a get up into town. Thanks for all the love and support. üèïüö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚õ∞ Hike on.<br>#2019appalachiantrailthruhike #appalachiantrail #atthruhike #atnobo2019 #georgiatomaine #at2019 #traillife #backpacking #adventureawaits #explore #exploremore #optoutdoors #thruhiker #katahdinorbust #ichallengeyoutoalloutlife #thetrek #backpackerradio #TrektheAT

Haven‚Äôt even had service on the mountain peaks. But it is what it is ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.<br>So after leaving the Hiker Hut back in Rangeley, we had a beautiful day heading up and over the Saddleback mountain range. Had some awesome views of the many lakes in maine. By the end of the day i had made it to Perham Stream just at the base of Lone Mountain. <br>Monday morning came and so did the rain. Took my time eating breakfast and getting everything packed up. 9am rolled around, still raining. Noon rolled around, still raining. 2pm, still raining. Just laid in the tent listening to podcasts waiting for the rain to stop. Finally, around 3:30pm it had stopped. Knowing i had a mountain to climb and being entirely saturated from the rain I waited until the next day to head out. <br>Tuesday morning i headed out and up Lone mountain. It was still overcast and very wet. Walking along parts of the trail, being so overgrown, I‚Äôd brush up against leaves, bushes or trees and would get soaked from all the water. It was slow going that day. Wet rocks and wet roots. Eventually made my way down the backside of North Crocker Mtn and hit that 2000 mile marker. Officially a 2000 mile thru hiker. üëçüëä. Pitched my tent at the Cranberry Stream Campsite at the base of the Bigelow Mountain Range. Had a huge group of teenagers set up at the campsite, dang they‚Äôre loud ü§£. Wednesday morning came and could tell i was in for some weather. Winds were gusting and was humid. Made the 2500ft climb up to the Bigelows and got above tree line. This was the most sketchy section of trail I‚Äôd experienced yet. Winds were easily exceeding 50+ miles an hour and could barely see 10 feet in front of me. Most of the hike was ok when in the tree line but as soon as i got out above tree line and into that wind on the ridge, it was a fight with every step. Using my trekking poles as support to keep the wind from knocking me over. It was pretty fun and exhilarating ü§£. Once i got down the Bigelows and got down around 2000ft in elevation everything calmed down. Eventually got into the Little Bigelow Lean-to that night and (rest comments)

The views were amazing!<br>‚Ä¢<br>But I'll be honest. I'm having a rough time with the steep descents, and Mt Moosilauke was no exception. I fell at least 4 times coming down and it freaked me out a bit. My hands were shaking, and I really wanted to quit the trail... Even as I'm writing this on 9/3/19, I'm still struggling mentally with the terrain I'm hiking each day. I'll be fine, but it's not always happy times out here. üòÇ<br>‚Ä¢<br>But I got down the mountain and into town. The ladies at the Notch Hostel took real good care of me. üòä So grateful. I felt a little better. Especially when someone cancelled their bunk. It was supposed to rain that night and all day the next day. So instead of having to camp outside (they were fully booked. The whole town was due to Labor Day), I got to stay all warm and cozy inside. üòä

The first 5 miles were great, but the last 10 seriously kicked my butt.<br>‚Ä¢<br>On the way up, I'm almost run over by a doe as I turn a corner around a tree. Her eyes are panic stricken. I jump off trail to the left and she veers off, down the mountain, to my right. A few moments later, a fawn follows, but veers up the mountain to me left when it sees me. It bothers me that they're separated, but there's nothing I can do. A couple minutes later, a couple with a dog off leash come down the trail. I tell them about the deer, and they remark that their dog spooked the doe and fawn. That explains why the doe was so terrified. ‚Ä¢<br>The views along the way are awesome. I find a giant orange mushroom. It's wider than a basketball. The camera doesn't capture the colors quite correctly, though.<br>‚Ä¢<br>On my way down the mountain, it starts raining.

I start to tear up with relief and happiness. The trail magic is still there! This is one of my toughest days on trail so far. Perfect end to such a challenging day. ‚Ä¢<br>Later, we all head to Devil's Backbone. The weather has cleared up. We take a group photo and some of us play corn hole.

So after getting off Baldpate Tuesday night i got to a beautiful waterfall called Dunn Falls. It had some decent tenting spots but most were pretty covered with roots, but managed to squeeze my tent into a nice spot. Had the sweet, sweet sounds of water falling all night which put me out like a light. <br>The next morning having my morning coffee next to the falls was surreal. Was joined by a few hikers (Argues and Temp) I‚Äôve been leapfrogging with and enjoyed some company. Past by Andover, ME that day and hit Sawyer Notch. A straight down descent into the notch and straight up ascent to Moody Mtn, talk about huffing and puffing, üòÇü•µ. We had a risk of heavy rain that night and had about 10 miles to go until the next Lean-to (what Maine calls shelters). I didn‚Äôt feel like staying in my tent with the risk of heavy rain so I tried to make the Lean-to. It was a good push, I think 18 miles for the day, which was the most I‚Äôve done in a day since Vermont üôÑ. Ended up making it to the Lean-to by 7pm and by 7:30pm it was starting to rain, i made it! üòé. We had about 4 guys in the Lean-to that night. With a capacity of 6 it was perfect, just enough room for everyone to be comfy. It rained pretty good that night from midnight to 3:30am. By 7:30am the Clouds were gone and sun was shining. Another great cup of morning coffee üòÅ. The trail today was the first day of relatively flat elevation. Passing by about 4-5 ponds or lakes the were absolutely gorgeous. Had allot of evidence of moose (mainly poop on the trail ü§£) but still have yet to see one, hopefully one day. Seeing allot less SOBOs now. I think that bubble has finally passed and seeing just the slower ones, or ones that started later. Ended up finding a nice tent site about 2 miles south of Rangeley, ME in a beautiful pine forest. Had another hiker show up pretty late and set up right beside me, never met him. <br>The next morning had about an hour hike into The Hiker Hut Hostel and was greeted with an egg and cheese breakfast sandwich, üòÅ. Their shower is outside and along a creek with really hot water. It wasn‚Äôt enclosed (rest in comments)

It happened to be Little Jo and with his guitar.  He used to keep it in it's official case, but that kind of made it look like he had a rife strapped to his pack, so switched to just bubble wrap part way in as it was freaking people out.  Little Jo had previously attempted a thru-hike in 2016, he had started that hike with a banjo, but part way into his hike he sent the banjo home when he got this smaller Martin backpacker guitar.  As he meets people along his journey he often has people sign his guitar.  After taking some photos I gladly signed it too. Not only is it impressive to be trekking the AT, but doing it with a musical instrument is even more impressive.  Little Jo took to the trail this year on March 30th for his second NOBO thru-hike attempt, I have faith he'll make it this year.  Great meeting you Little Jo and keep trekking! üì∏Photos by: @justin_goodhart_photography<br>#appalachiantrail #harlemvalley #hikerportrait . .<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#makeportraits #pawling #hudsonvalley #photoshoot #trailshoot #makeportraitsnotwar #harlemvalleyatcommunity @harlemvalleyatcommunity @nynjtc @iloveny #upstateny @appalachiantrail  @native_landscapes #trailmagic #humansofnewyork #dutchesscounty  #environmentalportrait #neverstopexploring  #nikonnofilter #athiker #appalachiantrail2019 #appalachiantrailconservancy #appalachiantrailboardwalk @appalachianmountainclub  @appalachian.trail #athiker2019 #atnobo2019 #trektheat #appalachiantrailthruhike @dutchesstourism #whiteblaze #atthruhike2019 #travelguitar #martinguitars #metronorth

I am a victim of sexual harassment.<br><br>It took a hostel owner making a series of seemingly passable ‚Äòa little too friendly‚Äô comments, progressing to blatantly over-the-line comments, plus a few additional over-the-line interactions with hikers in a short time span of a few days to slap me in the face. Truth is, I‚Äôm used to brushing it off. I think that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre taught to do so we aren‚Äôt ‚Äòoverreacting‚Äô or ‚Äòcausing drama‚Äô or whatever bullshit societal norm keeps us quiet for so long. Don‚Äôt make a big deal of it. It wasn‚Äôt a big deal.<br><br>In this moment I relived glimpses of hundreds of over-the-line comments that I‚Äôve experienced on trail and in my life. And I‚Äôve never said a thing because my knee jerk reaction was to pretend it was not a big deal, when in reality the words made me want to crawl out of my own skin or disappear. And I relived so many times I‚Äôd overheard comments towards other women and never said anything. It‚Äôs everywhere on trail. It‚Äôs everywhere in real life. But they‚Äôre *just* comments, so I‚Äôve brushed them off. I don‚Äôt want to be dramatic.<br><br>I felt naive on my 131st day on trail. Naive for having been in the dark for so long. But I also felt awake and empowered. Dismissing over-the-line comments has the side effect of dismissing over-the-line actions. I‚Äôve lost my ability to pretend like it‚Äôs not a big deal. Thank you, trail, for teaching me something important today. üì∏: Bigelow Peak, view from the North Horn

It was frustrating to have strong lean bodies and a craving for exercise, but not be able to stay active because we were still too sore and broken. But for the last several weeks we've been able to run pain-free! Sunshine officially has NO symptoms of plantar fasciitis anymore. Whew. Blue still uses a knee brace but it's mostly just preventative. This seems like a good analogy for post-trail life: wanting to do things but not quite being able to because circumstances are limiting. We are working on building up our funds again and reestablishing our civilized lives again. Finding our next goals and adventures to look forward to and grasping all the big and little ways the trail had changed us. It is slower moving than we'd like, but we are right where we are supposed to be: Together.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #appalachianthruhike #atclassof2019 #atnobo #atnobo2019 #thruhike #optoutside #hikerhunger #hikertrash #appalachiantrail2019 #hikerfeed #marriage #trailrunning #posttraildepression #posttraillife #lifeaftertrail

The past few days have been some of the hardest trail yet. I‚Äôve been lucky to get anything over 10 miles in a day. Got to the infamous Mahoosuc Notch yesterday, in the guidebook is the ‚Äúmost difficult or fun mile on the AT‚Äù. It was both fun and difficult but ate a good chunk of the day. Then, right after the Mahoosuc Notch was the Mahoosuc Arms. A steep, rocky boulder climb up 2000ft. It was rough. Got into Speck Pond Shelter and collapsed, üòÇ. Still have about 50 miles of ups and downs until it finally flattens out, until then, it‚Äôs slow going. Still getting some epic views of maine and can still see Mt.

I gave myself three months and five days to see how far I could walk from Georgia‚Äî expecting to make it to Harper‚Äôs Ferry (~1000mi). Little did I know, that in that time, would dash through 10 states and make it over 1400 miles to Connecticut! Here‚Äôs some sights from my last four states- PA, NJ, NY, and CT. .<br>Departing from the trail was bittersweet; I was saying farewell to an old friend I‚Äôd grown to know so well. Farewell to a lifestyle framed by the sunrise and sunset, guided by the watering holes, shelters, mountain peaks, and meadows along the way. A life centered around small increments of forward progress in a constant trek towards Maine. One that cultivates a deep appreciation for the smallest pleasures like like a snail on the perfect moss patch, a patch of sunlight after a rainstorm, or some nice toilet paper. <br>Through New Jersey I hiked with old and new friends for hours and for days! I was fortunate enough to be rejoined by Christian for the last 15mi of my journey as he geared up to return to the long trek after healing for over a month. My parents met us at my finish and we embraced at Connecticut‚Äôs border, ‚ÄúThe Gateway to New England‚Äù. .<br>Hiking the trail has taught me immensely, built me up to be a more resilient person, in a way that‚Äôs difficult to summarize on a facebook post. I‚Äôve learned to be more self reliant, confident in my own decisions. How to quickly switch strategies when things inevitably go awry. I‚Äôve become more comfortable in solitude, exercised self-reflection and introspection. Learned to live in the moment and celebrate the unexpected. I‚Äôve experienced moments that exemplify the generosity and warmth of mankind. I‚Äôve learned to ‚Äúembrace the suck‚Äù and power through the hard things while moving ever onwards. This trek has been the hardest thing I‚Äôve done so far. Bolstered by this experience, I‚Äôm excited to soon begin the next, most challenging journey of my life- navigating a PhD at UW Madison.<br>.<br>I can‚Äôt wait to return to the trail one day to finish what I‚Äôve started. Maine is calling.

All the wildcat peaks are named Wildcat A,B,C and D with Carter Dome thrown in there somewhere ü§£. It still had allot if sketchy diwnhill but had a little more of an actual trail than what I‚Äôve been going through the past week. <br>The first night i camped at a little stealth spot on top of peak C just before Carter Notch Hut. It got pretty chilly up at 4200ft, probably in the 40‚Äôs. Headed to Carter Hut the next morning and grabbed a few baked goods and some coffee and chilled for a bit before tackling Carter Dome, another steep climb of boulder infested trail üôÑ, but would be the last for awhile. Met allot of day hikers during the day but really thinned out as i dropped down off the ridge. I made a good push to get to Rattle River Shelter (which was free) for a 15 mile day. Got into the shelter about 6pm and instantly felt the difference in elevation, the shelter was sitting at about 1200ft, much warmer. Had a group of teenagers set up camp and doing what teenagers do üòÇ. Currently at Rattle River Hostel doing laundry and taking a shower then heading out to the next tent site.

Nose to the grindstone. My specialty. I got lucky and made a few friends, did the Whites in perfect weather without a drop of rain, and jumped off a bridge into a river. I hustled, sweated, got eaten alive and...wondered every single day why the fuck I was still out here hiking this trail.<br><br>I started the AT to put a peg in the three-board hole that makes up the triple crown of long distance trails (AT, PCT, CDT). I expected, having done the PCT first, that this trail would pale in comparison. But it was a necessary accomplishment‚Äîif I wanted to be a triple crowner.<br><br>And then the day before the Maine border came, before the final state I had to cross off a list of 14. I camped alone and wrote again what I had written in my journal so many times before: ‚Äòwhat the hell am I doing out here‚Äô. There were moments‚Äîblips, really‚Äîwhere I‚Äôve enjoyed this trail. But I‚Äôve been doing it for a title, not for the experience. I‚Äôve been grinding every day since Springer mountain. Not getting vortexed. Not getting sucked into mile-delaying plans. In my journal, the night before the Maine border, I wrote: ‚Äòit‚Äôs not too late.‚Äô Not too late to enjoy this. To do it for the experience and maybe get a title as a bonus. But live for a title? For a prize, for a distinction...it‚Äôs not my path. It‚Äôs a waste of my precious life.<br><br>For Maine, I‚Äôm all in. I am here. One step at a time, one view at a time, one hostel, one conversation, one swimming hole at a time. I have about two weeks left, and I am finally opening my arms to let in everything the trail has to give. Moseying through the Mahoosuc Notch. Spending an entire weekend at the geodesic dome of the Human Nature Hostel. Taking the time to sit and sit and sit and talk to people. To let one-on-one conversations happen. To let people in.<br><br>Letting the sun shine on my face and gravitating, ever so slowly toward that monolith in the north. To Katahdin. Orbiting within and around every step along the way.

Stayed the night at a nice stealth spot by Webster Cliffs (first pic) and had a great sunset. The next morning headed out and up the presidential ridge line. Starting with Mt. Webster to Mt. Jackson and getting to Mizpah hut by 1pm. <br>For most of the hike through the white mountains national forest, the AMC (American Mountaineering Club) have huts scattered about 10 to 15 miles apart along the AT section. The huts are like mini hotels on top of the mountains. Each has bunk style beds, bathrooms and has full kitchen which serves breakfast and dinner. Throughout the day they‚Äôll have baked goods,(cookies,muffins) coffee and lemonade for sale. You can‚Äôt get breakfast or dinner without staying in the hut which is pretty pricey, but any leftovers are usually offered to thru hikers for a little bit of work. I walked into the Lakes of the Clouds Hut about 9am and asked if they had any leftovers. The caretaker said if I‚Äôd help clean some of the rooms for 20-30 minutes i could get an ‚Äúall you can eat breakfast‚Äù, i said hell yeah ü§£. After filling my belly i made my way up to Mt. Washington, a very busy section of trail. You can drive your car up to the top so it was tourist central üôÑ. They say there‚Äôs only about 40 days a year where clouds aren‚Äôt covering the top of Washington. I got up there and the wind was calm and nit a cloud in sight, it was pretty epic. Made my way down to Madison Hut and stayed at the Valley View Campsite about 0.6 miles down a steep side trail. The next morning headed back up the steep trail and had breakfast at the Madison Hut. One if the options here was if you told a joke and they laughed, you got your breakfast for free, they laughed at my joke üòÅ. Headed down Mt. Madison to Pinkham Notch Visitor Center and just beat the rain. Next up is the Wildcat Ridge which has some insane uphill boulder climbs, think I‚Äôll wait for the rain to stop before tackling this üòÇ. Thanks for all the love and support. üèïüö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚õ∞ Hike on.

After all the beautiful days in Vermont and heading into NH, rain, cold and fog would block any of the beautiful scenery  from sight. Was heading down Mt. Lafayette on a rainy, foggy morning and took my first major fall since North Carolina üò≥. Everything was wet from the rain that morning and was taking it slow and steady, but just happened to step on that one tree root and my foot got out from under me. Went pack first down hill between a rock and a log, sliding down the log until my pack wedged enough to stop me, which was awesome cause a had a 2 foot drop coming up. Gotta thank my pack for always having mu back, literally and figuratively üòÇ. Banged my calf pretty good and a few scratches on the elbow, felt like i had a huge knot in my calf for the rest of the day, i just walked it out üòâ. I‚Äôve been noticing that most of the effort in the whites isn‚Äôt the uphill, but the downhill. As long as i keep a good slow and steady pace uphill it‚Äôs manageable. The trouble lies with the down hill. Climbing down boulders, down smooth rock faces where one little piece of dirt between your shoe and the rock could send you sliding down 10 to 20 feet into another boulder ü§™. After twi days on Franconia ridge, literally as I‚Äôm coming down the ridge. The clouds start to part and sun starts to show and finally get to see the beauty that has been blocked for two days. The whites are amazing and humbling so far. <br>#2019appalachiantrailthruhike #appalachiantrail #atthruhike #atnobo2019 #georgiatomaine #at2019 #traillife #backpacking #adventureawaits #explore #exploremore #optoutdoors #thruhiker #katahdinorbust #ichallengeyoutoalloutlife #thetrek #backpackerradio #TrektheAT

He is a big fan of Jazz and often listens to some music as he gets ready in the morning.  His trail name is after Django Reinhardt, who I'd heard of, but never really listened to.  We chatted for a while about the trail, music and what the village of Pawling has to offer hikers (he was taking a zero there the next day with a stay at the @stationinn for some R&R). On my way home that evening I found some Django Reinhardt on Spotify, and boy is it good and have been listening to it often since.  Django took to the trail on March 17th for his NOBO thru-hike.

He is a big fan of Jazz and often listens to some music as he gets ready in the morning.  His trail name is after Django Reinhardt, who I'd heard of, but never really listened to.  We chatted for a while about the trail, music and what the village of Pawling has to offer hikers (he was taking a zero there the next day with a stay at the @stationinn for some R&R). On my way home that evening I found some Django Reinhardt on Spotify, and boy is it good and have been listening to it often since.  Django took to the trail on March 17th for his NOBO thru-hike.  Have a great rest of your trek Django! üì∏Photos by: @justin_goodhart_photography<br>#appalachiantrail #harlemvalley #hikerportrait #doveroak .<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#makeportraits #nobo #pawling #hudsonvalley  #makeportraitsnotwar #harlemvalleyatcommunity @harlemvalleyatcommunity @nynjtc @iloveny @appalachiantrail  #trailmagic #humansofnewyork #dutchesscounty  #environmentalportrait #neverstopexploring  #nikonnofilter #athiker #appalachiantrail2019 #appalachiantrailconservancy #thetrek @appalachianmountainclub @georgiatomaine @appalachian.trail #athiker2019 #atnobo2019 #trektheat #appalachiantrailthruhike @dutchesstourism #wildeast #ATclassof2019 #whiteblaze #hikeny #thruhiker #hikethehudsonvalley

She started this year on June 19th in Harpers Ferry and is trekking to Katahdin.  Of course her trail name came from carrying a DSLR camera with her on the trail.  I offered her some portraits even though it's a Canon (LOL, joking, but I shoot Nikon and we photographers like to razz each other). When not on the trail she is a professional photographer, so I'm sure she's getting some amazing pictures out there!

He‚Äôs from central Ohio and walking the AT to decompress after retiring from Honda. He started on April 7th and even though he runs half marathons he feels the Trail is the most challenging thing he‚Äôs ever done. However in so many other ways it is also the most rewarding thing he has ever done. His plan for the next few weeks is to leave his tramily and push the pace to get to Rutland in Vermont. He‚Äôs then going to drive home for the birth of his third grandchild and spend a few days at home with the new baby. Then it‚Äôs back to the trail where he hopes to meet up with his tramily so that he can finish the trail with them. <br>Congratulations Hobo, have a safe drive and we look forward to seeing you on the trail again very soon üì∏ @jane_haslam_photography<br>@jules.hikes<br>.<br>. #appalachiantrail #harlemvalley #hikerportrait . .<br>. <br>#makeportraits #pawling #pawlingny #hudsonvalley #photoshoot #makeportraitsnotwar #harlemvalleyatcommunity @harlemvalleyatcommunity @nynjtc @iloveny #upstateny @appalachiantrail  #trailmagic #humansofnewyork #dutchesscounty  #environmentalportrait #neverstopexploring  #nikonnofilter #athiker #appalachiantrail2019 #appalachiantrailconservancy #edwardrmurrowpark @appalachianmountainclub @georgiatomaine @appalachian.trail #athiker2019 #atnobo2019 #trektheat #appalachiantrailthruhike @dutchesstourism #wildeast #hitthetrail #grandparentswhohike

Then had a bunch of up and downs until hitting Mt Wolf. Most of the day the trail was rather quiet, only seeing may 3 SOBOs and 1 group of day hikers. Got to Eliza Brook Shelter around 3, took a little break then headed up Mt Kinsman. Allot of boulder climbing and rock scrambling on this one with a hint of mud just to add variety ü§£. Had to put the trekking poles away so I could use both hands, first time I‚Äôve done that in 1800 miles üò≥. Using tree branches as leverage and wedging my feet in between boulders to get a foothold. There was no dull moment today üòÅ. Got to the top of Mt Kinsman about 5:30pm and had a great view of the Presidential Mountains coming up. Made my way down and hit Kinsman Pond Shelter about 6:30pm. Quickly set up camp and made dinner, i was hangry. Have 1 other thru hiker and a few groups of section hikers camped out. Have a good night everyone.

I was quite tired today apparently. I click on my vid clips to get a better sense of what happened on this day.<br>‚Ä¢ <br>The day starts off with some nice views. As I "blaze down the trail", I spot my first turtle. I think it's a box turtle. It hides in its shell when I try to get a closer look.<br>‚Ä¢<br>I find a couple of new flowers. I think one is some type of morning glory. I also see a cool, green caterpillar on a tree.<br>‚Ä¢<br>Passed the 800 mile marker! Woot! These markers are flying by quickly as I increase my daily miles towards 20s.<br>‚Ä¢<br>At the end of the day, we are hit with a bad thunderstorm. It's one of the few times I've been scared or worried on trail. I see, hear, and feel it coming before it hits. I'm near a lake shore and about 2 miles ish from the shelter when the storm front smashes into the forest. I try to hike as fast as I can, but there's no way I'll avoid being in this storm.<br>‚Ä¢<br>The wind rushes in first before the dense curtain of rain. I'm stare up at the trees around me and pray a branch doesn't fall on my head. The rain comes down in sheets. I have my rain gear on, so I'll be warm, but my shoes are soaked through. It doesn't take very long before I worry about the stream crossings ahead and flooding on the trail. It's raining that hard, that much. ‚Ä¢<br>The first two stream crossings are flooding, but not enough to cover the way to cross safely. The third stream, though, is flooded out and wider than the rest. I can still see the path of rocks I'm supposed to take, but I stand at the shore and doubt my ability to cross. I unbuckle my pack straps incase I fall; I'll be able to get my pack off faster. I also try to text my tramily members about the flooding, but I have no signal. ‚Ä¢<br>As I'm crossing, Northstar appears behind me and starts to cross. I'm glad I'm not alone. We both make it and head towards the shelter. The rest of the tramily trickles in. We're wet, but safe and warm. After we change into our dry clothes, of course.üôÇ<br>‚Ä¢<br>Pics<br>1&2.

A Hero is when you hike in and out of a town on the same day. Usually involves the normal town chores, but you don't spend the night there. ‚Ä¢<br>The bridge into town is neat. It's one of the longest pedestrian bridges that we've crossed. The river is beautiful. ‚Ä¢<br>Our tramily is quite large and at this point, there are 8-10 of us. We decide to hitch into town. It's well known that ladies have an easier time getting rides, so we put out our thumbs. As a joke, the boys hide behind the bushes. We take pics of "Hitchhiking Boys vs Girls" üòÇ It takes about 5-10 min before two cars pull up to take us into town. I ride in the back of a pickup truck. The wind rushing by feels wonderful. ‚Ä¢<br>Glasgow has a Brontosaurus statue. Some of us can't resist taking pics in front of it, including myself. Dinosaurs are awesome. üòÇ<br>‚Ä¢<br>We eat at the Italian diner in town. At this point, I think we are dipping in and out of town quickly, and skip my usual trip to the library. The majority of the group, however, decide to hang out longer in town. As it gets later, though, I realize that our original hiking plan for the day is shot. I'm iching to get back on trail since I don't want to stay in town overnight and I don't want to night hike. After talking with a few other tramily members, 4 of us head out on a shuttle back to the trail head. ‚Ä¢<br>We make it to the shelter before dark and set up camp. Eventually the rest of the group arrives at the shelter, late. It is well after hiker midnight and before I head to bed, a little excitement occurs when Turkey feels a big bug on him. Turns out it's a cicada nymph! I've never seen one before it had transformed into an adult cicada, only the shell. I pick it up and set it on a nearby tree. Cicadas are one of my favorite insects. I'm so thrilled to see a nymph! üòÄüòç<br>‚Ä¢<br>Pics<br>1&2. Bridge into town. One of the longest pedestrian bridges on the trail.<br>3-5. Hitchhiking boys vs girls <br>6.

Beds were a little creeky but definitely been on worse. Had to wait for my resupply package at the post office which didn‚Äôt open until noon. So took full advantage of the DVD movie library they had. Watched Clerks and Forest Gump, such a great movie. Noon rolled around, got my package, stocked up on food and got my cold weather gear back. Got back on trail just before 1pm and headed up Mt. Moosilauke. The first mile was a gradual  ascent the it was straight up. Tried getting pictures of how steep it was but none were doing it justice, trust me, it was steep. Got about halfway up and was taking a big step up a huge uprooted tree, when a rabbit comes shooting down the trail out of nowhere, scaring the crap out of me. I continued to watch it just cruise down the trail and quickly looked up trail, just to make sure it wasn‚Äôt being chased. Stood there for a few seconds, bunny was gone but no pursuing party appeared ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è IDK, guess he was going for a jog üòÇ. It took about 2 hours but eventually got to the top and man was it worth it. Hands down best view so far on the AT. There‚Äôs allot more coming up but Mt Moosilauke didn‚Äôt disappoint. Sat on the summit for a bit and had a snack while enjoying the view. Meet a few day hikers but no thru hikers were around. Eventually headed down Moosilauke to Beaver Brook Shelter. Passed by the 1800 mile marker on the way down, less than 400 miles to go üò≥. The tent pads at this shelter suck, rocks and roots poking out everywhere and not very flat, but ended up making one work. Have a good night everyone.

Started the day off heading up Smarts Mountain, about a 2500ft climb. Luckily it was a nice dry day cause it would have been pretty sketchy walking up some of those flat rock sections. Had some nice views from the top though. Had an old fire tower to get above tree line. Could see Mt Moosilauke off in the distance, which will be the start of the EPIC climbs ü•µ. Had lunch up top and talked to a few hikers. Headed down the backside of Smart and headed right back up Mt Cube. A rocky, rooty, steep SOB but with another great view. Stopped and chatted with a few more hikers and found out we all started this adventure within 2 days of each other. Also connected with a girl i had camped with on day 2 of this hike. Crazy to think its been over 4 months now. Headed down Mt Cube and crossed over Brackett Brook. The original plan was to head up 4 more miles to Ore Hill Campsite but found some nice tent sites right along the brook. Everyone else decided to stay here also, legs were done. Got about 15 miles in today, a hard earned 15 miles. Have a good night everyone.

I can't wait to see this famous landmark. On the way I spot a cool moth and add its portrait to my insect photo collection. üòÇ<br>‚Ä¢<br>Dragon's Tooth is massive as it juts up from the ground. I climb up to the top and towards the tip. I'm about 3 feet from the edge when I chicken out and head back down. It's super windy up there. The view, amazing.<br>‚Ä¢<br>Then the next hour has me cursing the trail, trail maintainers, trail organizers, trail anything. I'm climbing down, NOBO, from Dragon's Tooth. Well, in my opinion it's not a trail. How can sitting on your butt so you don't fall to your death be considered a hike-able? There's even a small section of rebar. I'm stressed. I HATE IT. It's the first time I've ever truly hated the trail. Not even the lure of town food can pick up my spirits.  One mile takes me well over an hour to complete. Ugh. üò•üò¨üò¥<br>‚Ä¢<br>After I arrive at the bottom of the mountain, I start trying to put myself in a better mood. I begin my Grateful For ritual, listing off things I'm grateful for. It helps a bit. Not too long after hiking to the bottom, I'm at the Catawba Grocery store eating pizza. I'm starting to feel better, and it helps to compare notes with The Great Fish about the day.

As I hike, the pain isn't too bad, so I plan to hike 23 miles. Not long into my day I pass one of the oldest oak trees on the AT. Mojo, who kindly pointed out this ancient tree, also takes my picture. You can kind of see how huge it is.<br>‚Ä¢<br>The views today are great. They're my favorite kind; where you can see mountains for miles and miles. The bluish horizon meeting a bluish sky. üòä<br>‚Ä¢<br>I pass the Eastern Continental Divide sign as well. I had no idea it existed, so that was a nice surprise! ‚Ä¢<br>We see the orange newts/efts on trail all the time, but not what they look like as adults. I'd always wonder what they looked like all grown up. The Universe rewarded my curiosity when I was filling up my water. An adult salamander swam over and sat on my bag for a little while. It's so cute! It's also such a stark difference between the brilliant orange of the juveniles and camouflage greenish/grey of the adults.<br>‚Ä¢<br>A steep climb 4-5 miles from the shelter kicks my butt, and the pain from my hip is starting to flare up a notch. I can't complete my 23 miles. While taking a break on a bench, Classic Rock stops by and we're both exhausted. We decide to hike a couple miles to a campsite. However, we don't make it all the way. The stealth site at the Audie Murphy Memorial is too tempting, and stop there for the night.<br>‚Ä¢<br>While we eat dinner, we are visited by one of the most brave and curious wild rabbits I've ever seen. It hops near us and snacks as we chat and ponder at how this rabbit got so "tame". üòÇ<br>‚Ä¢<br>Pics<br>1. Keffer Oak Tree. According to Guthooks, it's estimated to be 300 years old.<br>2&3.

There is also a nice blue blaze view there but I was too tired to hike down to it.

My original plan is to hike 20+ miles, but I don't think that's possible in that moment. ‚Ä¢<br>Plus my bag is HEAVY with extra food. I bought too much when I resupplied, but don't want to throw any of it away. I make a plan to get to a shelter 9-10 miles away, and go from there.<br>‚Ä¢<br>The day is wonderful. There was a chance of scattered thunderstorms, but none appear. Blue skies and meadows are some of my favorite combos of the day. I also find a new flower.<br>‚Ä¢<br>I get to my first goal of the day and decide to hike on towards the next shelter. I make it there, but am tired. With the mile road walk out of Pearisburg, I've hiked nearly 22 miles. One of my biggest days. I chat with new hikers I haven't met before as we eat our dinners. Not long after I head to my tent and zonked out. üòÇ<br>‚Ä¢<br>Pics<br>1. Blue skies above the meadow. üòç<br>2. New purple ish flower I found. <br>3-5.

I rush to get them all done and try to catch up on my social media accounts with posts. But that's always a losing battle since I always run out of time. Eventually I have to sleep.<br>‚Ä¢<br>Which I try to do, but can't once I realize that this hotel doesn't have black out curtains to block out the light. There's one glaring just above my door and I can't turn it off. After some thinking, I tie up my sleeping bag/quilt as a black out curtain.

You have to visit there sometime. It's one of my favorite places I've seen on my hike of the AT. It's a perfect place to camp and swim.

The light kept me awake. Today is rough. All I want to do is sleep. Just lay down in the middle of the trail and sleep. I take lots of breaks.

I have better luck with rewatching my vid clips for the day on how it went.<br>‚Ä¢ <br>It was a good day. As I was dropped off at the Brushy Mtn Outpost, Doc gets out of a car. I thought he was way ahead, so it was nice to see a familiar face. We both eat breakfast at the Outpost and make plans to camp in the same place for the night. ‚Ä¢<br>Today, the hike was "flat" compared to other days. It was great to zoom along the trail. I stop by a campsite and find some cool artwork on the trees. I also find trash. üòï I pack out some wash clothes since there is a trashcan where I'm heading to for the night. ‚Ä¢<br>As I hike, I startle a deer that was on trail. She runs off a bit before stopping and resuming her walk through the forest. I channel my inner paparazzi. üòÇ<br>‚Ä¢<br>Before Trent's Grocery, there's a suspension bridge. It's unique on trail and I take lots of photos. It sways as I cross it. It's neat.<br>‚Ä¢<br>We camp out at Trent's Grocery and order dinner at their grill inside. It's nice to catch up with Doc and hear the story behind the founder of the Lickskillet hostel. It's an interesting story for sure. üòÇ<br>‚Ä¢<br>Night arrives and the full moon in a clear sky lights up the field we're camped in. I take a few seconds to try to capture the moment.

I don't want to deal with it. Eventually I wake back up and head out on trail around 9 am. My calf muscle is still tight and not 100%, but I take it slow.<br>‚Ä¢<br>My plan is broken down in 5-6 miles increments. I'm not out of water, but I'm low. My first goal is the next shelter. Then the campsite 5 miles from that. Then Bland, VA if I can still hike that far.<br>‚Ä¢<br>The forest is beautiful. I love how the sun rays shine through the canopy. It's difficult to capture how magical it looks on my phone.<br>‚Ä¢<br>Thankfully my calf muscle feels better than yesterday and I'm able to make all my goals. I even try to stop by Brushy Mtn Outpost before they close to get a burger and a soda. Apparently they close early often, so I was out of luck. Another hiker and I were quite disappointed. ‚Ä¢<br>Determined to eat town food and drink soda, I call for a shuttle into Bland. My night ensues in hilarity and unusual surprises as I arrive at the hotel, the only one in town, to find that their power is out. 90% of the reasons why hikers go into town are out of commission there: no power, no water, no heat. A few other hikers and I head down to the Dairy Queen to at least get warm food and drinks while we wait for it to be fixed.<br>‚Ä¢<br>At 9pm, the power comes back on in my hotel room. I quick shower and plug in my electronics to charge them. I turn up the heat, even though the room was already way warmer than it was outside. I'm content, warm, and sleep well. It was a strange day, but a happy one.<br>‚Ä¢<br>Pics:<br>1. The sun rays in the forest.<br>2. Trail Boss sign reminds me of video games.

By this point, I knew it was going to happen somewhere south of Katahdin. I knew my feet couldn't handle it much longer. I remember this moment so potently. I can still faintly feel it when I think of it, like the aftertaste that is left in your mouth after a bitter bite. My feet were pounding with white hot pain. The back of my knee was tender to the touch. My stomach was growling. My head was light and spinning. And my heart felt like a water balloon, sinking deeper and deeper into my stomach with every passing moment as we waited for a navy blue Honda Odyssey to pick us up. It is nearly impossible to describe the magnetism of the trail, the pull it has on your heart, constantly toward itself. There is a reason hikers will persist past the point of common sense. Through broken ribs. Through Morton's neuroma. Through bone spurs and fractures and giardia. It's because, to you, getting off trail is synonymous with "going home." But to us, it's synonymous with "leaving home." Everything about walking through that mountain air, suffering through that weather, hiking past the cicadas and sleeping with the mice, it feels natural and right. Going to Walmart and driving to work and having conversations with people when you aren't sure if they really mean what they're saying- that doesn't. Today Blue and I put our bare feet on some grass to get the slightest tinge of that feeling back. The thought of sleeping outside again feels like a deep breath after spending too many seconds underwater. People say the trail will "ruin your life." They aren't being dramatic. What they are trying to say is that now, and maybe for the rest of your life, you're going to feel a little homesick. But man. It was worth every second of suck.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #appalachianthruhike #atclassof2019 #atnobo #atnobo2019 #thruhike #optoutside #hikerhunger #hikertrash #appalachiantrail2019 #hikerfeed #lifeafterthetrail #posttrail #posttraildepression #postthruhike

I scared them, they freak out while scaring me, i freak out. It was a viscous cycle üòÇ. Got to Happy Hill Shelter about 3:30pm and debated on going the 3.5 miles into Norwich, VT. The spring at the shelter was totally dried up and i had about a half a liter of water. The next shelter was almost 9 miles out which wasn‚Äôt going to happen. I had seen a flyer at the last road crossing for the Norwick Hiker Hostel that just opened up a few months prior. I called to see if they had any bunks open ( thought cause of Saturday they‚Äôd be full) and they did. So i huffed it 3.5 miles in an hour and a half. Told my legs to sit down, shut up and hold on, we‚Äôre doing this ü§£. Made it to Norwick by 5pm and got a ride to the hostel. Free laundry, free showers and all you can eat eggs, pancakes and coffee in the morning, yea buddy. Hope everyone has a good Saturday night.

Picture 6 hikers out with headlamps on clanging trekking poles around camp trying to scare it off üòÇ. You never know if they will return so you sleep with one eye open, luckily it didn‚Äôt üëç. Headed out of camp about 7:30am and began the day. Keep running into more and more SOBOs. They‚Äôre pretty useful for knowing whats up ahead, especially trail magic üòÇ. Had lunch at the lookout cabin (pictured) and had some great views of the mountain ranges coming up. I‚Äôm not exactly sure but i think i could see the southwest portion of the White Mountains. Those will be coming up in a few days üò≥. Continued on and had allot of climbing. Nothing more than 1200ft but they were steep. Straight up the mountain than straight down. The knees have been holding up pretty good considering all the bashing I‚Äôve put them through. Weather has been great. Had a few clouds roll through that looked like rain but nothing fell. It‚Äôs been mid 80‚Äôs and sunny, can‚Äôt complain üòÅ. Found a nice tent spot next to a creek. It‚Äôs in pretty close proximity to a road but should die down as the night wears on.

It happened at 745am complete with cake, singing, and of course bananas.  It made me realize that soon I'll be back to real life where birthday parties don't happen at 745am, cake for breakfast isn't healthy, and the booze we consumed before noon would qualify us as derelicts according to most.  I really can't fathom returning to the real world just yet, but that's okay because I have 800 miles to figure that out... Just a reminder to savor every minute, every mile, and every smile left on this journey.  #atnobo2019 #thruhike

Drank a few local brews. Tried out 2 different styles of their sour beers and really enjoyed em. Had a nice hot breakfast provided by the hotel and waited for the rain to stop. Most of it cleared out by 10:30am then headed over to the Base Camp Outfitters to wait for the resupply package from moms. Had to order a new battery for the phone, it just wouldn‚Äôt keep a charge very long. With the white mountains and the 100 mile wilderness coming up it had to be taken care of. <br>Got back on trail about 2:30pm (mail took its sweet time) and instantly got attacked by mosquitoes. They love the smell of a fresh bathed hiker üòÇüôÑ. Said goodbye to the Vermont Long Trail and started heading east towards New Hampshire. Had a pretty sweaty climb up Quimby Mt. about 1300ft in less than a mile. Listened to a pretty big thunderstorm pass by just south of me, didn‚Äôt get wet though üëç.

Why, you ask?<br><br>We've had the privilege of hiking two of the most storied long distance hiking trails in the country, as the Vermont Long Trail (est. 1930) overlaps with the Appalachian Trail (est. 1937) for slightly over 100 miles. We've seen amazing sights from mountains like Stratton, Killington, and Bromley. We've smelled the familiar pine, walked through old growth forests, drank the purest and coldest of water, eaten crab apples more sour than any candy, and have indulged all the joys of life in the woods - even finding the silver lining as we were getting drenched by rain this morning. Sometimes this trail delivers the lowest of lows and forces you to confront an ugly version of yourself, but our spirits in Vermont have been lifted higher than the towering hardwoods surrounding us as we walk. <br>A special thanks to our friend and fellow hiker "Roll On" (@petershambo ) on behalf of the many hikers whose spirits he lifted with his kindness and cheerfulness this past week. He and his wife Gail are the epitome of "trail angels". Thanks also to all of you, whose support and encouragement means more than can be conveyed. We will draw on it more than ever in our final push, which begins tomorrow as we cross into New Hampshire! - üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è&üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è #thruhike #thruhikers #hikertrash #appalachiantrail #atnobo #atnobo2019 #longtrail #optoutside #beanoutsider #hiking

Had a nice 10 mile hike to VT 11 and caught a hitch into town. Manchester was a super nice trail town, i had 2 people offer me to stay overnight to get cleaned up and have a roof over my head, it was tempting but was looking forward to staying on top of Bromley Mt tonight. Ate 2 footlong subs from subway, charged up the electronics and got a new water filter. For the past month the mini has gradually gotten to be a pain in the butt, so a new one was desperately needed. Headed out of town about 4:30pm, quickly got a hitch back to the trailhead and began the climb up Bromley Mtn. There‚Äôs a sky patrol building on top that allows thru hikers to stay the night, even has a restroom, üòÇ. As long as the wind stays down and the rain stays away it‚Äôs going to be a good night. Have a good night everyone.

The Vermont Long Trail had an event called ‚Äúhike the long trail in a day‚Äù. Every 15-20 miles along the trail they set up trail magic to help support the event, us AT hikers got to reap some of those benefits, ü§™. Could always tell a LT hiker between a AT hiker, the packs were new and shiny, üòÇ. Got stopped with some trail magic about noon, just in time for lunch. The Connecticut chapter of the green mountain hiking club had set up a nice refueling spot for hikers. Sat and talked to some great people for about 30 minutes then headed out to begin the climb. From here it was a 1200 ft climb up Stratton Mtn, legs were feeling good and wasn‚Äôt too steep so it went by pretty quick. Got to the top and had about 20 people waiting to head up the fire tower. There was a hotel and restaurant on top of the Mtn so it was busy. Took some awesome pictures on the fire tower then headed down the north side to Stratton Pond Campsite about 3.2 miles downhill. Got to the campsite next to Stratton pond, in Minnesota this would be a lake, much bigger than a pond. Had to pay $5 to camp here but it was worth it, had a beautiful view of the ‚Äúlake‚Äù from my site. Vermont is shaping up to be my favorite state yet. Weather has been picture perfect, bugs aren‚Äôt to horrendous, and views are awesome. Keep it Vermont!!

Iron Will has one of the craziest stories I've heard about grit and determination.  He took to the trail on February 16th in GA with his brother.  Part way into his hike he slipped on some ice and broke his femur.  He knew he was hurt but didn't think it was broken and hiked for about another 150 miles before he was convinced to get it checked out.  After they discovered it was broken he got off trail and rehabbed for about 6 weeks.  Then he went up to NH to get back on trail with his brother and they hiked and summited Katahdin together.  Then started hiking SOBO from NH back down to where he got off trail with the broken leg.  Seems like nothing can stop Iron Will from completing his 2019 thru-hike. <br>It was great meeting you Iron Will and hike safe! üì∏Photos by: @justin_goodhart_photography<br>#appalachiantrail #harlemvalley #hikerportrait #doveroak . .<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#makeportraits #nobo #pawling #hudsonvalley  #makeportraitsnotwar #harlemvalleyatcommunity @harlemvalleyatcommunity @nynjtc @iloveny @appalachiantrail  #trailmagic #humansofnewyork #dutchesscounty  #environmentalportrait #neverstopexploring  #nikonnofilter #athiker #appalachiantrail2019 #appalachiantrailconservancy #thetrek @appalachianmountainclub @georgiatomaine @appalachian.trail #athiker2019 #atnobo2019 #trektheat #appalachiantrailthruhike @dutchesstourism #wildeast #ATclassof2019 #whiteblaze #hikehappy #hikeny #ironwill

We can't bring ourselves to put our packs in storage. Or wash them. They are still stinky and leaning against the walls on our respective sides of the bed. We still use our Zpacks wallets. Sunshine is back at work, and her new idea of makeup is sunscreen and chapstick. We are wearing deodorant and feel low-key like a fraud every time we roll it on. We are excited to have our apartment soon, even though we don't have hardly any furniture to put in it. Above all we are thrilled to be back in our friends' daily lives. We are really lucky to have a great group of people in our lives, and we missed them terribly. We have a new love for staying active, which is proven by how many times we've gone trail running or weight lifting or rock climbing or swimming since we've been back home. Our bodies have all kinds of new quirks that make physical activity hard, but if we learned anything on the trail, it was persistence. We still get irritable and anxious when we drive. We still sometimes sit on the ground when we are outside because it didn't even occur to us to use a chair. And we think about our memories and our tramily every single day. Yesterday a cocktail reminded Blue of a specific campfire at Double Springs shelter with our tramily, and it made him teary-eyed. The trail is forever in our hearts. It may feel like a universe far removed from where we are now, but we are still hiker trash. And there isn't a day (or even an hour) that passes where we don't think about the AT.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #appalachianthruhike #atclassof2019 #atnobo #atnobo2019 #thruhike #optoutside #hikerhunger #hikertrash #appalachiantrail2019 #hikerfeed #ATstrong #tramily #memories

There has been a lot of sun, plenty of thunderstorms, rocks to high heavens, thick shrubbery, and funny encounters with wildlife. Our travels have included a boat, but we mostly trek forward with our feet in our shoes. All 500+ mi of Virginia are now behind me, as are West Virginia, Maryland, (and soon, Pennsylvania). I‚Äôve passed the halfway point (1440th NOBO hiker through Harper‚Äôs Ferry this year) and past mile 1200. I was briefly joined by old housemates from Maitri, and hiked with Medium Salsa (Mark) for 120+ mi, foraging herbs and fungi all along the way. Most nights we saut√©ed chanterelles and chicken of the woods with Perilla leaves. Once Mark returned to DC, I became a solo hiker for the first time in my hike. .<br>In Shenandoah, Bamboo and I got up to higher mileage, eventually doing consecutive 23, 25 mile days! However, I‚Äôve been slowing down recently.<br>.<br>With only two weeks left to hike before departing for a wedding and graduate school, I find myself lingering and savoring the experience while I can. Focusing on ‚Äúsmiles, not miles‚Äù, a fellow hiker‚Äôs motto. Bamboo‚Äôs sudden departure from the trail reminded me not to take this adventure for granted, and that I owe it to myself to make the most of it while I can.<br><br>Happy trails!<br>-Carpenter<br>.<br>#AT #atthruhike #hiking #hikePA #hikeVA #shenandoahnationalpark #hikeWV #hikeMD #appalachiantrail #appalachiantrail2019 #nobo #atnobo2019 #womenoftheAT #solohike #solowomentravel #portclintonPA #shenandoahnationalpark

He didn't start smoking until he started walking on the AT....lots of stories.  But the one thing that really stuck with me was when he extolled how humans have 3 basic needs: Food, Water and Love.  Right on Pops, right on! <br>Pops took to the trail this year in GA on January 29th, got off shortly after to help build a home for a friend, then got back on in earnest on March 9th for his NOBO thru-hike.

Only three states left, üò≥. Vermont, or better known as Vermud. Known quite well for its pockets of black, slippery mud along this section of the AT. The AT will follow the Vermont Long Trail for 105 miles at which point the AT turns east to head into New Hampshire. <br>Had a beautiful morning at the Bascom Lodge. Breakfast wasn‚Äôt until 8:30am, so i ate some food from the food bag and got back on trail. Most of the morning was downhill into Williamstown, MA. They had a Grocery store about 0.5 miles off trail so i headed over to grab some lunch. Had a decent climb heading out of town, but once i hit the top it was see you later MA and hello Vermont. About 3-4 miles after that i hit the 1600 mile marker. Two big milestones in one day, NICE. Vermud has been living up to its name so far. We haven‚Äôt had allot of rain lately so allot of the big muddy sections are drying out. Rolled into camp about 6:30pm to Congdon Shelter. Have allot of LT (Long Trail) hikers here hiking this section of trail. Dinners about done so i gotta go.

Had a quick climb up Crystal Mtn before heading back down into Cheshire, MA. Stopped at the Dollar General for a soda and headed out. From here it would be a gradual climb over the next 8 miles heading up to Mt Greylock, which is the highest peak in MA. Hiked through some beautiful pine forests and swampy sections. Had a good downpour roll over about 2:30pm but only lasted about 15 minutes, then the sun popped back out. Eventually got to the summit of Mt Greylock (3491ft) and came up on the Massachusetts Veterans War Memorial standing there all beautifully. I went up the spiral staircase inside and tried taking pics but none turned out good, excellent view though. Staying the night at Bascom Lodge which is right on top of Mt Greylock. Today was a great day, the temp cooled off allot since the rain came through.

CT and MA have been pretty strict on thru hikers camping along the trail. Hikers must stay at established camps or shelters, heard there was a $500 dollar fine if a ridge runner (forest ranger) catches you, not sure about that though, Ive seen five in the past few days. Sooooo, i was left with either go 7 miles to Mt Wilcox North Shelter or go the 21 miles to Upper Goose Pond Cabin, the decision was obvious, üôÑ. Past through some beautiful Massachusetts countryside today. Met allot of day hikers going up Cobble Hill, they all asked the 20 questions every thru hiker gets asked, lol. Passed by Main Rd which heads into Tyringham, MA and came up on a little hiker shack full of goodies. The AT Hiker Stand, I‚Äôve been seeing pictures of this for about a week on Instagram and was hoping to pass it soon. It was located on a residential property just off the road and had cold sodas and gatorade, snacks and candy, it wasn‚Äôt free, you still had to pay but it was pretty cool the family decided to put that up, there wasn‚Äôt much for stores around there so it was nice to grab a cold drink. Ended up getting into Upper Goose Pond Cabin around 7:30pm and pitched the tent. This is a two story cabin with a caretaker, has a wash room, living room and nice porch in the front. Was hoping for a bunk on the second floor but it was full, kinda figured coming in so late. Planning on sleeping in a little bit to let the legs rest tomorrow. Have about a day or so until Dalton where ill probably take a nero. Have a good night everyone.

Got back on trail about 8:30am, it was Saturday so I thought i could sleep in a bit, ü§£. Had two climbd to get the blood pumping this morning, one up Mt Race (pic from this morning) and one up Mt Everett. Kept leapfrogging with a group of 5 hikers all day until most of them headed into Great Barrington, MA for resupplies. Got into a low swampy area just before the Shays Rebellion Monument (pictured) where the mosquitoes were absolutely relentless. I would try keeping a good pace and make sure ever part of my body was moving, just so they couldn‚Äôt land. I tried lighting a cigar to confuse them but that didn‚Äôt work, so i just started running, üòÇ i ran for about 1/4 mile before i got to the road and they had stopped pursuing me. I took a break at Shays Monument and waited for the three behind me, ghost got it the worst, her whole left arm was filled with bites, stupid mosquitoes. Made it to Hwy 7 about 3:30pm where most of the hikers disembarked into Great Barrington. Got a little trail magic thanks to Ron from The AT Trail Magic Van, it was cool, just a middle aged man, driving an old cargo van and opening the back door filled with sodas, snacks and fruit inside, ü§£üòÇ. Currently chillen here at Tom Leonard Shelter where the SOBO hikers actually out number the NOBO hikers, üò≤. Really hoping this weather keeps up, it has been getting into the 50‚Äôs at night and mid eighties during the day, plus the humidity has been low, feels great. Have a great Saturday night.

Picked up my resupply package and was back on trail by 9:30am. The first order of business was climbing Mt Prospect, about a 1000ft climb but was spaced out for a few miles so it was over before i knew it. Had a nice descent down into Salisbury, CT with about a mile of road walking. Next order of business was climbing Lions Head, about 800ft but over a very short distance, STEEP. It had a nice view at the top and a nice breeze to dry all the sweat. After that it was Bear Mountain (not the one in NY) it was a nice gradual climb from Lions Head so it really didn‚Äôt feel that bad. Now coming down the north side was a different story, it had allot of very sketchy boulder hopping, most of the foot holds were on slick rock so you‚Äôre hoping your foot doesn‚Äôt slip out from under ya, üò≤. It eventually flattened out then i made my way into Massachusetts, 10 states down, 4 to go. So far New England has been beautiful and the people have been awesome.

Did the usual routine and was back on trail by 7:30am. The trail in CT has been awesome, been hiking through allot of pine forests that smell amazing. Got to CT 341 about 1:30pm and headed into Kent, CT which was 0.8 miles off trail. Had planned to get to the outfitter to grab some new socks and seam sealer but found out they had closed at the beginning of the year, that sucked. So instead i went to the Kent Welcome Center and got a shower and charged up the phone, they also had a hot dog stand with some brats. I family was out section hiking the CT portion of the AT while i was there drying out there gear, they got stuck in the heavy storms we got here a few days back. I was about to head back on trail and they graciously offered me a ride back to the trail head, that was awesome, saved me about a half hour walk back, ‚ò∫Ô∏è, the trail provides. The next portion of the trail was great, Hiked rite along the ten mile river for the next 5 miles, beautiful section of trail. Finished the day off at Silver Hill Campsite, its pretty sweet. It has a porch swing, a pavilion with picnic tables and even a deck with a view, can‚Äôt beat it. The weather has been picture perfect, a slight breeze and mid 80‚Äôs with sunshine, much better than last week, ü§£. Have a good night everyone.

When you return to civilization there is so much to do, and quickly. People you want to see and who want to see you because you've missed your home-community for several months. Adulting to catch up on, like finding work and a place to sleep every night and renewing the tags on your car because they expired while you were gone. And all of it is done while awkwardly processing and realizing the ways you've changed. It's normal to be irritable, and then to feel guilty about being irritable because you're supposed to be "chill" and reconnected with yourself now... Right? It's normal to drive slower than everyone else. It's normal to get "peopled out" way easier than you used to. It's normal to feel a little unsure and uncomfortable as you settle into things that are entirely familiar, but inside you feel different. Do your best to remember the trail everyday. And the things you said you'd do and be when you got home. Carry over your abilities to give and receive freely with the community around you. Stay active however you can and eat good foods. You got this. (Also, some shoutouts: to our tiny Honda Fit who faithfully toted our king sized mattress today, to all the sweet pups who feel like kindred souls in an intimidating world, to the meals our friends' hands built with care for us, and to all the people who are happy to see us again and fill our lives with love and joy).<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #appalachianthruhike #atclassof2019 #atnobo #atnobo2019 #thruhike #optoutside #hikerhunger #hikertrash #appalachiantrail2019 #hikerfeed #lifeafterthetrail #posttraildepression #community #friendship #candid #honestsocialmedia

Hello Connecticut, how you doin? ü§£<br>Had a super wet night last night, didn‚Äôt stop raining until 9ish and my tent started to leak. Think I‚Äôm going to stop in Kent, CT which i should be there midday tomorrow, and see if they have any seam sealer, think the stuff i put on awhile ago is gone. The morning started out meh, it was cloudy, wet and just kinda walked and tried not to slip on rocks. Got to a landscape store about 3:30pm that was right on the trail. They have a little hiker store and food, grabbed a few things and headed on up just a tad. Noticed that there was a food truck parked at the AT parking lot, you know i hit that up. Grabbed a few tacos and a coke, that really picked the mood up. I still had about 10 miles to go before Ten Mile Shelter so i kicked it in gear. Headed up to Hammersly Ridge through the Pawling Nature Reserve, which had some nice trail, then headed down to Wiley Shelter. That was my original goal for today but really wanted to hit the Connecticut border. Headed down to Hoyt Rd and crossed into CT, üëçüòù. This is my first time in CT, it‚Äôll be brief, but I‚Äôm sure gunna enjoy it. Have a good night everyone.

Woke up to a beautiful 71 degree morning with blue skies. Got back on trail about 7:30am and had a nice morning and afternoon hike, the trail was a little more forgiving today. Stopped into a deli about a half mile off trail and grabbed a few sub sandwiches to munch on for the next few days. I looked at the radar while i was there and seen we had a few bad storms heading our way. They looked to be about 2 hours out and i had 4 miles to the next shelter. I slammed my redbull and it was game time, I wasn‚Äôt getting caught in this storm, not this time, ü§£. I cracked the whip and started walking like one of those fast paced olympic speed walkers. Got about 2 miles up and it started sprinkling a little then it rained pretty good for about 2 minutes, could hear the thunder rolling. It sprinkled on and off until i reached the shelter, i made it with out getting drenched, üôèüòÅ. Had a few other thru hikers all ready chillen in the shelter with the same plan as me. About 15 minutes later the storms came rolling in, heavy rain, lightning, thunder but not much for wind. The rain has been off and on for the rest of the night. Eventually set up my tent when i could, i had planned to just stay in the shelter but the mosquitoes were ravenous in there, couldn‚Äôt take it anymore, I‚Äôd rather be a little wet than be eaten alive all night. The rest of the week is looking good, sunny and mid 80‚Äôs during the day and have a few nights that‚Äôll be in the 50‚Äôs, üò≤, that‚Äôs good sleeping weather. Still loving New York though, it‚Äôs so beautiful. Have a good night everyone.

Today is supposed to be the last day of the heat wave, then 85 degrees for the rest of the week, üòÅ. Had about 14 miles to Clarence Fahnestock State Park which has an area for thru hikers to set up, plus showers and a store with ice cream, so i used that as motivation for hiking through this heat. The trail was rather calm today, it had a few steep up and downs but nothing to grueling. Got into the state park about 3:30pm, quickly set up my tent and headed for the store, the grill closed at 4pm so i had to hustle. Met up with a few other thru hikers that were at the Graymoor last night, we were all just beat from the heat. I ran into the lake to cool off for a bit, it felt amazing, but it was really crowded, had to brush off a few wanna be hooligans, ü§£üí™. Currently eating two cheeseburgers for dinner, much better than rice sides, üòÇ. We‚Äôll see you all tomorrow.

Woo! Had a little ran come through last night, nothing much, just enough to get everything wet. Got back on trail about 8:30am and headed for Lake Tiorati, free showers and vending machines, yea boi. Got all that grime off me and charged up the phone for about an hour then headed out. First on the things to climb was Black Mtn, I‚Äôd rate it 5/10, it was steep and had a few boulder climbs but with an elevation gain of 500, it just couldn‚Äôt compete. Next was West Mtn, I‚Äôd rate it 6/10, it had some nice boulder staircases and some nice views up top, but again with an elevation gain of around 700ft it went by before i said hello. The last beast of the day was Bear Mtn, I‚Äôd rate it 8/10. This one had the grand daddy of boulder staircases mixed with some boulder climbing, plus had vending machines at the top, 5 points right there. The fourth pic is the view from the top of Bear Mtn, you can‚Äôt see it because it was so hazy out but you can see the New York City skyline, it‚Äôs about 30 miles away. Climbed down the backside of Bear Mtn and made my way into Fort Montgomery, NY. Walked around Hessian Lake which had people picnicking everywhere, got offered allot of food and graciously accepted. Headed out if the park and walked on Bear Mtn Bridge over the Hudson River . Had one last climb up Anthonys Nose (thats what the Mtn‚Äôs called ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) and headed into camp. I‚Äôm spent peeps, allot of climbing and heat today. Were in an extreme heat advisory fir the next two days so probably gunna take a nero tomorrow and enjoy some food, we‚Äôll see.

The AWOL AT guide wasn‚Äôt joking when it showed ‚ÄúDespite the unimposing profile, rocks and abrupt ups & downs make this section challenging‚Äù. From Fitzgerald Falls, Mombasha High Point, Buchanan Mtn, Arden Mtn, the Lemon Squeezer and Island Pond Mtn, there was allot of climbing involved. I‚Äôd say half was straight up rock climbing and the other half was trail rocks, made for an interesting day. The Lemon Squeezer was a huge slab of rock you had to walk thru and it got narrower and narrower, i had to take the water bottles out of my pack to fit. New york has been beautiful so far, allot of variety throughout the day. It rained most of the day so i kept my phone in the pack, when the screen is wet it doesn‚Äôt work anyway. It‚Äôs supposed to clear up tomorrow so hopefully get more pics of this beautiful state. First day in New York was an adventure, but the mosquitoes are ravenous, can‚Äôt stop for a second before they‚Äôre all over you. Have a great night everyone.

You return to a world that didn't change much while you were gone. It kept moving, but it stayed the same. And it is so far removed from the life you just left, that your hike starts to feel like a distant memory. Like maybe it never happened. You'll probably be surprised to realize how even your closest family or friends appear to have no interest in your journey at all. Instead of asking questions, looking at your pictures, or listening to your stories- they will be just as happy to talk about their own routines. And it will hurt. Because while you still care about their lives and what they've been doing, realistically their lives did not change nearly as much as yours did. And you'll be eager to share it and process it with others. People might expect you to be the same person. But you won't be. Y'all- look through your pictures often. Find low impact ways to stay active because running is probably gonna be a big NOPE from your knees and feet. Stay in touch with your other hiker friends. And expect to be very hungry for a couple weeks as you deny your hiker hunger to avoid gaining 500 pounds. But most importantly, try to have patience for the people in your life who don't "get it." They will be the majority. .<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#lifeafterthetrail #posttraildepression #posttrail #afterAT #keepinitreal #appalachiantrail #appalachianthruhike #atclassof2019 #atnobo #atnobo2019 #thruhike #optoutside #hikerhunger #hikertrash #appalachiantrail2019 #hikerfeed

Got back on trail around 9ish and made my way to the NJ/NY border, oh yeah! Another state down and 6 to go, üò¢. Headed up to Prospect Park which is the highest point in New York on the AT and a nice American flag to honor it. We were doing allot if rock climbing and boulder crawling for most of the day and in the exposed sun. By about noon i had drank almost 4 liters of water and was drenched in sweat. I looked at the weather and showed it felt like 113 degrees, so i headed into Greenwood Lake which was 0.8 miles off trail and headed to the gas station. They had a little rest area in the store, so i chilled in the A/C and hydrated. Spent a few hours cooling down and headed out to the next shelter which was 3 miles up trail. By the time I‚Äôd gotten to the shelter i was drenched again. Met up with a few hikers that had the same mindset, take an early day, drink lots if water and prepare for the rain tonight. Supposed to be a high of 80 tomorrow so that will be a relief. Being this far into New York is officially the farthest north I‚Äôve been on the east coast, it‚Äôs all new territory from here, üí™üòé. Have a good night everyone.

Between a momma bear and her cubs to what i think is a deer groaning at us, we slept with one eye open for most if the night. It looks like were getting back into climbing gear again, had a few decent climbs of about 1000ft, think New Jersey is getting us ready for New Hampshire, ü§£. Got onto the AT Boardwalk about 2:30pm and had about a mile of flat, sun exposed hiking, it was HOT. After we got out of that we hit NJ 94 which had a roadside hit dog stand and Heaven Hill Grocery store. Got me three hot dogs and a diet coke, a nice cold refreshing diet coke in a 98 degree day is almost heaven, ü§§. I sat and chilled there for about an hour and a half and continued on. I had about 5 miles to the next shelter and plenty if day light left. But first, the Stairway To Heaven, a 1200ft climb up a boulder infested mountain, with the name and all, I thought it was going to be grueling but ended up being just a warm up, üòÇ. Got into Wawayanda Shelter about 7:30pm and made a quick dinner. Another beautiful day in New Jersey, got every type of terrain thrown at me today, made for excellent day. Have a good night everyone. Thanks for all the love and support. üèïüö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚õ∞ Hike on...<br>#2019appalachiantrailthruhike #appalachiantrail #atthruhike #atnobo2019 #georgiatomaine #at2019 #traillife #backpacking #adventureawaits #explore #exploremore #optoutdoors #thruhiker #katahdinorbust #ichallengeyoutoalloutlife #thetrek #backpackerradio #TrektheAT

After two days of driving, we made it from Saco to Indianapolis. We spent our last night in the magic bus in the parking lot of a hotel in DuBois, PA. Something we feel really grateful for, is the feeling of doneness/closure as each phase of the journey comes to an end. When we climbed Katahdin, we felt ready. When we moved out of the van, we felt ready. And soon when we return to our sweet home city of Louisville, we will feel ready. Instead of it all feeling bittersweet, so far, it just feels sweet. Although realizing that Sunshine's car had grown mold was not sweet. And getting a $51.50 bill in the mail from a toll bridge in Jersey (which we didn't even know we crossed) was not sweet. Oh well. It be like that sometimes. Thank goodness for savings accounts and white distilled vinegar!<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #appalachianthruhike #atclassof2019 #atnobo #atnobo2019 #thruhike #optoutside #hikerhunger #hikertrash #appalachiantrail2019 #hikerfeed #lifeafterthetrail #posttrail #postthruhike #mold #tolls #itbelikethatsometimes

Got on trail about 8ish and made my way up Sunrise Mtn (pictured) which had a nice pavilion and benches with a nice view. About 2 hours later i was coming up on Rutherford Shelter and scared 2 bears away, one was up in a tree maybe 15 ft up, as soon as he saw me he did the quickest tree slide I‚Äôve ever seen. He hit the ground so hard and made such a thud that I thought he‚Äôd broke his buttocks, but he ran off like Forest Gump, üòÇ. I got into High Point State Park (Pictured) and stopped in the office. They‚Äôll give ya a free Pepsi if you sign their hiker log, sounded like a great deal to me. I grabbed a few more snacks and a package of gummy bears for a snack tonight. Headed out about 3:30pm and headed up to High Top Tower (pictured) which is the highest point in New Jersey. Climbed up to the tippy top but wasn‚Äôt much of a view.

Ever since we got that ran on Friday, the humidity has been at an all time low, it really makes the days better and the nights comfortable, i hope this stays this way for awhile. The last resupply i got from my mom back in the Delaware Water Gap, she sent packaged creme filled crepes, one chocolate and one strawberry for breakfast in the morning. WOW! Was that amazing for trail food, i dunked it a little but in my coffee to spice it up a little, way to go mom, üôè. Got back on trail about 8ish and came up to a beautiful beaver (pictured) damn about 4 miles up trail. Met allot of day hikers taking advantage of the beautiful weather and climbing to see the views. Had a few sections of rock but for the most part it was great walking trail, had got about 11 miles in by noon. Water sources were a little scarce today so had to make sure i filled up at everyone i could find. By about 3:30pm i had hit Culvers Gap which had a tavern 0.2 miles off trail, with a tavern that close you gotta stop right? üòé. Stopped in at Gyp‚Äôs Tavern (pictured) and grabbed some food and a beer. This place was a hiker gem, they had charging stations, free water fill ups, free soda and a whole hiker resupply store, plus it was right off a beautiful lake. If you‚Äôre ever in the area, check it out, they‚Äôre awesome. I sat there with a few other thru hikers till about 6:30pm and made the 3 mile journey to the next shelter, was also the last water source for awhile. Got eaten alive trying to set up the tent and currently have 8 bastards trying to eyeball me like I‚Äôm some buttermilk pancake on a Sunday morning, ü§£. Have a great night everyone.

A friend of ours who had stopped by to chat offered him a ride and he quickly accepted, so he was off to get some shelter and a meal. <br>Have a great rest of your trek Healer! üì∏Photos by: @justin_goodhart_photography<br>#appalachiantrail #harlemvalley #hikerportrait #doveroak . .<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#makeportraits #nobo #pawling #hudsonvalley  #trailshoot #makeportraitsnotwar #harlemvalleyatcommunity @harlemvalleyatcommunity @nynjtc @iloveny #upstateny @appalachiantrail  #trailmagic #humansofnewyork #dutchesscounty  #environmentalportrait #neverstopexploring  #nikonnofilter #athiker #appalachiantrail2019 #appalachiantrailconservancy #thetrek @appalachianmountainclub @georgiatomaine @appalachian.trail #athiker2019 #atnobo2019 #trektheat #appalachiantrailthruhike @dutchesstourism #wildeast #ATclassof2019 #hikertrash #whiteblaze

This is the psychological or emotional halfway point of the trail for many thru hikers. ‚Ä¢<br>The real halfway point is about 50 or so miles from here for this year, as the trail has gotten longer over the years. Since I include Amicalola Falls in my hiking journey, my real halfway point won't be until mile 1100.01 üòÇ<br>‚Ä¢<br>At the ATC, you get your picture taken and a new number.

It will take effort to hold on to our gratitude for the little things. To not let our thankfulness fade away as we get further and further from the mountains of the AT. We don't want to forget what it's like to have nothing but the packs on our backs. Or to have to push through tough weather and terrain when your body and mind feel so spent.

The trail is still infested with rocks but man is New Jersey gorgeous. <br>It had gotten pretty chilly last night so i slept like a log, a Lincoln log in fact,ü§£. Went to the post office to get my resupply package about 9am and quickly added 20lb to the weight of my pack. I‚Äôve still been over packing on food when heading out of town, the first 2 days are usually pretty rough weight wise but means I don‚Äôt have to waste as much time going into towns ever 3-4 days. Headed out of the Delaware Water Gap about 10:30am and crossed over the Delaware River into New Jersey. It feels good to get PA behind me, we have been picking fights with each other for days, ü§¨. Headed into the Worthington State Forest with people everywhere, with such a beautiful day and just outside the cities it was pretty crowded. Ended up seeing two black bears and two ticks since being in Jersey, i fried the ticks with my lighter, no tick left alive, üòÇ. Passed the 1300 mile marker just before Sunfish Pond, just keep on knocking em down, üí™üòé. Today was probably one of the best hikes in a while, beautiful scenery, great people and great hiking, the first day in Jersey has been awesome. Pitched up the tent at this great campsite just down trail from the Fountain of Youth Spring, wonder if it will work? ü§£.

The A/C was set at 85 degrees it felt like and i was lying there sweating until about 4am when it finally cooled off. Around 1am i was so close to just getting up and setting my tent up out back. Had a good morning though, went down to the Apple Pie Bakery (pictured) and got a few cannolis with a coffee. I had got all my chores done yesterday so today was mainly spent relaxing and enjoying the nice weather. Sarge showed up about 2pm after hiking 17 miles, haven‚Äôt seen him in about 2 weeks. We ended up heading to the Doughboys Pizzeria and demolished a pizza and went over to the bakery for desert. This bakery is legit, home made anything you can think of, pies, cookies, cannolis, muffins, doughnuts the list goes on, i spent some coin in there, üòÅ. There is a restaurant called Joe Bosco Authentic Smokehouse BBQ that we went for dinner, they best brisket I‚Äôve ever had, it just melted in your mouth, definitely check it out if your ever in the area. We got back to the hostel and it was packed. The bunkhouse holds about 11 and is full and the tent area is 1-2 tents from being full, as you can tell from the picture, some had to get a room at the hotel down the street. Set up my tent tonight so I don‚Äôt have to deal with sweating all night. The rain we got last night really dropped the humidity and actually feels somewhat cool tonight, I‚Äôm liking it. Plan fir tomorrow is to wait for my resupply package from the post office and head out, thinking around noonish if all goes well.

A guide of sorts on what do do in the communities that the trail pass through and near.  We spoke a bit about how our local ATC (@harlemvalleyatcommunity) is part of a  pilot program and currently working with the national ATC to develop a similar kind of thing for our local area (app & web based) so we had a lot to talk about!

Woke up a little early to get a good head start heading into town. Had a few more boulder climbs and rocky sections but ended up following an old gravel road most of the day, which was nice. On the way down into the Delaware Water Gap a bee landed on the front part of my shoulder, when I moved my arm to brush it off i pinched it in between the strap of my pack and my shoulder, he didn‚Äôt like that and just barely stung me thru my shirt, it wasn‚Äôt much but definitely felt it. Got into the Delaware Water Gap about noon and took a much needed shower. Currently staying at the church of the mountain hiker hostel with about 20 other hikers, there‚Äôs a heap of hiker funk up in here, üòÇ. Planning on taking a zero tomorrow and rest the mind and body. The heat plus rocks have taken its tole on the ole feet. The outfitter in town rents mountain bikes, might try my hand at that for a bit.

Headed out of Delps Campsite around 8ish, there was no water at the spring last night so i waited on breakfast until i got to the shelter, pretty much B lined it there. About a mile or so before the shelter i was just doing my thing, walking and cursing at the rocks as usual. When i came to a fallen bees nest (must have fallen out of the tree) and almost stepped right on it. I said a few curse words, turned around and did the quickest 100 meter sprint over rocks I‚Äôve ever done in my life. Got far enough from it that I thought i was safe, stopped, looked back to make sure they weren‚Äôt following me and noticed one clinging to my pant leg, brushed it off and started circling me, once he realized all his other homies were gone he bolted back to his safe space, üòÇ. Cautiously walked back up trail until I noticed the nest and did a big circle avoiding that area. Got to the shelter and talked with a few hikers, sunshine got stung 3 times, joe got stung once and giggles got one, guess i got lucky or I‚Äôm just that fast, üòÅ. After that i got into Wind Gap and ventured the 0.8 mile trek to the gas station, got myself a nice refreshing ice cold 99 cent fountain coke, oooohwee did that hit the spot, think i had dreams about it last night, ü§™. Currently at Wolf Rocks Bypass, it has a good flowing spring and nice tent sites, was going to head up 3 more miles to the shelter but it was already 6pm and with the rocks another 2hrs, I‚Äôm good here. That leaves a 10 mile trek into the Delaware Water Gap and some good food.

Talk about some climbing today. Got down into the Lehigh River Gap about noon not expecting what was to come. The elevation profile looked like a steep climb of about 1000ft, but this was no run of the mill climb. For most of the sections it was straight up rock climbing, grabbing onto rock ledges, cracks in the rocks or whatever you could get ahold of. There was a blue blaze trail that went around the rock climb incase of inclement weather or the rock face is to wet, i see why know. The whole time i just had a huge grin on my face and started laughing to myself. Finally made it to the top and got a Kodak moment with an American Flag painted in the rock (pictured). You can‚Äôt see from the picture but I‚Äôm basically standing on a ledge with nothing but air in front of me, ü§£üòé. Had a nice flat trail for about 3 miles after that that ran along the ridge of Blue Mtn. I could see the town of Palmerton, PA down below, and started pointing out all the gas stations, saying ‚Äúi bet that one has ice cold cokes‚Äù‚Äùi bet this one has ice cream sandwiches‚Äù, ü§£ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Passed Little Gap Rd about 3:30pm and someone had set up a water cache, this whole section of trail has been really limited on water, so some awesome hiker left a few 10 gallon water jugs to help quench our thirst. Set up camp at Delps Campsite which had a spring 0.4 miles off trail. Went down the trail only to find the spring was dry, ü§¨. Luckily i filled up at the gap, üòÅ. Have a good night everyone.

We even ran into Samurai Blue, the man who kindly picked us up when I was injured outside of Harper's Ferry. He saw us on our worst day in West Virginia, and happened to be there to celebrate on our best day in Maine. The trail is a small world. We could think we were in the middle of nowhere and still run into a friend. If we spent any time with you at all, we are so grateful for you. Pretty much everyone we've met is our tramily.

Had allot of rain come thru about 10pm last night and didn‚Äôt stop until 9:30am. Woke up to a nice puddle under my feet. Got up and going about 10, after the rain had stopped and packed up camp. Did allot of boulder hopping, with a 35lb pack on it was pretty funny to watch but with the recent rain everything was slick. Never fell but had a few close calls, just took it nice and slow. Got to PA 309 about 1ish and was going to have a nice birthday lunch at the Blue Mtn Summit restaurant but they had gone out of business, that sucked, so i was relegated to eating the rest of my fig newtons, üòÇ. The sun finally popped out from behind the clouds about 4:30pm. I walked up to a parking lot about 2 miles south of the shelter and set my wet tent up to dry for a bit. It didn‚Äôt take but 30 minutes for it to be bone dry, live the material these things are made of. Got into camp about 7ish and found a nice tent site up on the ridge line at the Bake Oven Knob Shelter. I‚Äôd rate this one as a 8.8, no view but also a good distance from water.

When they realized we were traveling, a barista there recommended we check out the Big Boardwalk in Orono. We decided to do it even though an ominous storm was rolling in, and I am so glad we did. The storm created a certain apocalyptic vibe and made it even more exciting. And the plant life was fascinating! Pitcher plants, irises, etc etc. @willhembree  and @stephenrhornbeck ...

Headed out if Port Clinton about 9:15am and was greeted with some familiar faces as soon as I stepped foot back on trail. Mtn Sage, Joe and Sketch had just got back on trail from taking a zero yesterday in Hamburg, PA. Glad I didn‚Äôt head that way, rooms were $150 dollars per night! Thats not on a hikers budget, thats like 2 weeks of food in trail, üôÑ. Had about a 1000ft climb out of town where we would cruise at about 1500ft for most of the day. Had a few storms come through last night and cooled it off a little and had a little breeze, which felt great. Made it up to Pulpit Rock (pictured) around 1pm, which had a great view of the PA countryside. Took a little lunch and checked out the Pulpit Rock Astronomical Park about 100ft away. It was an amateur astronomical observation center with huge telescopes. Since it was Sunday, there were allot if families and day hikers out looking at the views, very popular section of trail. Made it down to Eckville Shelter with the intention to stay the night but all the tent pads were taken. It was a nice shelter with a shower, fully enclosed shelter and nice toilet, but i pressed on to find a place to set up my tent. Made the little climb up to Dan‚Äôs Pulpit which was infested with rocks and boulders, but finally found some flat ground with no sharp pointy rocks. Legs and feet are feeling good. Love to resupply and get new food but always sucks coming out of town with a full food bag weighing my pack down, üòÇ #thruhikerproblems thanks for all the love and support. üèïüö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚õ∞ Hike on...<br>#2019appalachiantrailthruhike #appalachiantrail #atthruhike #atnobo2019 #georgiatomaine #at2019 #traillife #backpacking #adventureawaits #explore #exploremore #optoutdoors #thruhiker #katahdinorbust #ichallengeyoutoalloutlife #thetrek #backpackerradio #TrektheAT

She told me about how the word "contentment" popped into her mind as she climbed one of the last mountains before Katahdin, with her finish-line just in sight. "That's it. That's the word I'm looking for, to describe this feeling I have out here," she thought. I remember telling her that I was glad she had that epiphany on a mountaintop before Katahdin, "so you wouldn't think contentment was something Katahdin gave to you. It was something you found in yourself on the way there." I won't forget how she smiled at me when I said that.<br><br>Blue and I were at the Dover Oak tree near Pawling, New York when we decided to end our hike. Not out of defeat, homesickness, or injury. But out of contentment. It was a sunny and beautiful day. We were in the presence of new friends, trail magic, and an old tree that started to feel like a friend, too. It felt right. We didn't come out here for one of us to drive all day and the other to hike alone. We weren't out here to prove anything, to go though the motions when our heart isn't in it, or to be stubborn about hiking every mile when we found our Katahdin long ago in each other. We came out here to climb mountains and dip into valleys together. And man, we did just that. <br>So we began a road trip. We connected with as much tramily as we could for final hugs and laughs and "see you laters". And we made our way to Baxter State Park.<br><br>Today, we summitted Katahdin not to find contentment, but to declare that we already had it. We are so proud of ourselves and each other. We are different now. Changed and strengthened in ways we never expected. And so ready to take every ounce of this learning and inspiration to our adventures back home!

That campsite last night was epic. Around 8pm a crew of 3 dudes I‚Äôve been leapfrogging with showed up at camp. I dared rambles to swing into the pond, he didn‚Äôt even hesitate, took his phone out, took his shoes off and tarsaned it right into the pond. I went next and the rest followed, water was definitely on the cold side but it felt amazing. We didn‚Äôt last long though, the mosquitoes thought it was supper time once the sun went down. The next morning, did the normal routine then got back on trail. Had a few really rocky sections but today the mud was my nemesis. We had a few storms roll through yesterday and it just sat on top of the trail, making us slip and slide everywhere, ü§£. Had about 18 miles into Port Clinton, PA and got into town about 4pm. Had a STEEP climb down into town, I couldn‚Äôt imagine going south on the AT and having to climb that with a pack, oofta. Port Clintons is a nice little trail town and is about 2 miles outside of Hamburg which has a Walmart and Wawa, gunna do a resupply there tomorrow. Planning on a zero tomorrow if everything goes right, be nice to get out if the heat for a bit. Have a good night everyone. Thanks for all the love and support.

Woke up feeling refreshed and ready to go. First order of business was crossing the beaver dam (pictured). Took off my shoes and put my camp shies on to prevent me from having to slosh around all day with wet shoes. The water was somewhat cold but more muddy than anything, i think i almost lost my sandals about 5 times in ankle deep mud and muck. First time having to walk through water on this trip, they usually have bridges. Me and 3 other thru hikers were crossing at the same time, i lagged behind and followed their tracks, üòÇ. Had a decent 1000ft climb out of Swatara Gap back up to the ridge line. The humidity was pretty rough today, met a few day hikers heading up that said screw it and headed back to their air conditioned cars, ü§£ü•µ. After that climb was the worst section of rocks, probably about a mile of boulder hopping and ankle twisting, but eventually smoothed out to some decent trail. Eventually made it to William Penn Shelter which was our first water source in 6 miles, chugged a half liter if water, had lunch and headed out. Got into Waggoners Gap Rd about 3:30pm and met an awesome couple with some trail magic, fresh ice cold coke and a whole bunch of cookies right when i needed it. I didn‚Äôt carch his name but said he‚Äôd hiked sections of the AT, CDT and the PCT, so i picked his brain for a little bit, üòâ. Headed out with a few candy bars in hand and past by the 501 Shelter, you can order pizza to this shelter since it‚Äôs right off a main road, but of course they were closed today due to the holiday. Hit the 1200 mile mark! Yea boi! Only 990.1 miles to go, triple digits. It‚Äôs crazy to think how far I‚Äôve walked, ü§Ø. Set up camp at Hertline campsite (pictured) and this place is sweeeet. Nice pond with a rope swing, water fall and nice chairs, it‚Äôs all a man could ask for, üòé. Listening to all the fireworks going off everywhere, I‚Äôm down i a valley so can‚Äôt really see any. Heading into town tomorrow and get some real food. Have a good night everyone. Thanks for all the love and support. üèïüö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚õ∞ Hike on...

The tent site i stayed at didn‚Äôt have a water source, that meant i really had to ration my H2O intake, yes that meant no coffee in the AM, üò¢. Packed up and got back on trail about 8am. I felt sluggish all day, just no motivation. Threw on the headphones and played some music for a bit, it helped, but not much. Ended up stopping and taking allot of breaks, past by a few nice campsites with some decent sitting logs and rocks. By the end of the day i had found a nice tent site next to a stream. Was gunna go about 4 miles farther but i have a nice long beaver damn i will have to ford, probably about shin deep. With the mood i was in i thought I‚Äôd wait to tackle it in the morning.

The poor magic bus has balding/cupped tires due to some suspension issue. Fortunately, we were in a town when we noticed and were able to immediately get a room and make an appointment with a local mechanic without going far. Unfortunately, tomorrow is the fourth of July, so all mechanics are closed and hotel prices go WAY up. We aren't happy about paying holiday prices, but we are happy to have noticed the issue soon enough that we are safe. And we are happy to be together, as always. We are making the most of it by cooking Jambalaya in our hotel room, going for a swim, and looking for mediocre movies on cable. Say some prayers they are able to fix it by end of day Friday so we can have our vehicle (and home) back! .<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #appalachianthruhike #atclassof2019 #atnobo #atnobo2019 #thruhike #optoutside #hikerhunger #hikertrash #appalachiantrail2019 #hikerfeed #ohwell #bettertogether adventures #hikers #carissues #positivity

Laid in bed until 9 and finished off the pizza from the night before for breakfast. Got back on trail about 11ish, made a little resupply before heading out. Crossed over the Susquehanna River (pictured) and made the rock infested climb out of Duncannan. Stayed up on the ridge line for the rest of the day. It was another hot one and was stopping at every spring to fill up, most of the springs where 5 or more miles apart and was going through a liter every hour. The pace was allot slower today due to the rocks but every now and then we‚Äôd get a good section and pick the pace up. Had a few views, mainly clearings for power lines and allot of graffiti on the rocks, must be a big hangout spot cause there was trash and graffiti everywhere, üòîü§¨. Ankles and the soles of me feet are pretty banged up, these trail runner shoes are nice and lightweight but don‚Äôt offer much protection from the jagged rocks, man up SCOTT! ü§£ü§™.

Their bodies are either a metallic emerald green or a metallic turquoise blue. They are stunningly beautiful.<br>‚Ä¢<br>I hike on and find a group of coral mushrooms? This time they're purple instead of beige. I take pics of the little red mushrooms I see on trail, too. ‚Ä¢<br>I'm almost 15 miles into my day when my left calf muscle tightens. I continue hiking. I'm determined to hike 25 miles. Besides I've hiked on tight calf muscles before and it wasn't too much of an issue. I'll be alright. ‚Ä¢<br>I visit Chestnut Knob shelter and wish I could stay there for the night. It's warm in there. Other hikers call it a hostel because it's fully enclosed, instead of a 3 sided lean to. It has 4G signal, for Verizon users at least. I eat dinner there, but chose to push on 4 more miles.<br>‚Ä¢<br>2 miles after the shelter, I'm in the worst pain, so far, that I've been on the trail. My left calf muscle is not only burny and pinchy, it's sore. I try to convince myself to get to the road crossing. There's a hostel from there.<br>‚Ä¢<br>But I don't make it. I'm in too much pain and limping. Although not in enough pain to call SOS on my Garmin. I know I need to stop immediately before I injure myself so severely that I'll need to use it. I search for a stealth campsite on the ridgeline. I tuck under some rhododendron and set up camp. I update my parents. I call Green Jeans as well since he's hiked the trail, and would understand best the mental panic I'm going through. He's great at calming me down since at this point I'm worried I'd just seriously injured myself. I can't thank him enough for his advice and help that night. üôÇ Not long after, I head to bed, hoping sleep will heal my mistake enough to hike the next day.

Woot! üòÄ<br>‚Ä¢<br>The day starts off late for a 20 mile day due to taking the public bus back to the trail head. The ride is 50  cents, so I have no complaints. üôÇ<br>‚Ä¢<br>Before I leave the visitor center, Sal or Wizard finds a Lunar Moth. It appears to be dead. They take it into the center to see if they'd like to add it to their nature collection. Turns out the poor thing is alive, but with the recent cold snap, it got too cold. We all take pictures and put it on a sunny rock.<br>‚Ä¢<br>The next excitement comes from a series of signs on the trail. The infamous one room school house is in Virginia? I had no idea. The local church supplies trail magic there during the season. The cold soda and chips I chose are amazing. There are rules on the walls for both student and teacher behavior. It's interesting. ‚Ä¢<br>I cross a fence and halt to a stop. It takes me a moment to realize I'm looking at Stronghold's memorial. I pay my respects and spend a few moments there.<br>‚Ä¢<br>Soon after, I pass the 1/4 sign at mile 548. It feels amazing to finish a quarter of the whole trail. ‚Ä¢<br>About 3 miles away from the inn, I see Sponge camped out on the side of the trail. She's been dealing with an injury since our 24 hour challenge, and has to stop for the night. I hope she feels better soon.<br>‚Ä¢<br>I make it to Quarter Way Inn around 745pm. I'm way beyond exhausted. Tina is awesome and helps me get settled in. She says a big slack packing group is still hiking in. I take a shower asap. I'm selfish and want to soak under the hot water before everyone gets here and uses it up. üòÇ<br>‚Ä¢<br>While picking my bunk, my eyes light up in surprise. On two bunks are cards that say Whiskey and Turkey. I'm excited to see them again, but most importantly, ask them questions about some things Antman said during our convo.<br>‚Ä¢<br>The slackpackers arrive and my curiosity is fulfilled.

This means stream crossings could be tricky to cross, so I share the news with the other hikers as a heads up. ‚Ä¢ <br>I get up and out of camp. 0.5 miles away I realize I forgot one of my water bottles. I turn around and go back. I can't believe I forgot something again after the fiasco the day before. The silver lining this time is I'm able to tell Sole Surfer about the flooding on the trail so she knows what to expect. ‚Ä¢<br>As I hike, I nearly get run over by a pony running down the trail. We both see each other at the last second due to a green tunnel curve in the trail. It veers off to my left. It's the second pony I've seen that day, and also the second one where we've startled each other due to a green tunnel situation. I'll have to be more cautious. ‚Ä¢<br>Not too long after I see a herd of ponies grazing. They're too busy eating breakfast to hang out like the other ponies I met yesterday. I'm still just as excited and take pics. But I have a ways to go and keep hiking.<br>‚Ä¢<br>As I'm crossing a gap between meadows, I talk to Bear, Blueberry's husband. We chat for a bit. He's supporting her as she hikes and they meet  up at gaps/road crossings. It's neat to see how that works for them. He also shares a heads up about water and such. üôÇ<br>‚Ä¢<br>Not much else happens and I see no more ponies. I think it's because of the rain. I understand since I'm tired of hiking in wet clothes. I decide on a 15 mile day and hike to Dickey Gap. I head into Sufi Lodge for a shower. It's great.<br>‚Ä¢<br>Pics:<br>1&2. Ponies!<br>3&4.

Grayson Highlands, and the surrounding area, is famous for their "wild" ponies. My 17 mile day takes me straight through it all. üòÉ<br>‚Ä¢<br>On my way up, I pass through a cow pasture. It's full of calves that are curious about me. I stand still a few moments to see which one is brave enough to let me pet it, but they don't get close enough. They do follow me down the trail for a bit. üòÇ<br>‚Ä¢<br>I continue hiking up the mountain I'd already climbed the night before. It sucks, but unavoidable. Eventually I get back to the point I had to turn around, and continue on. Now I finally feel like I'm making some progress today.<br>‚Ä¢<br>Before I get to Thomas Knob shelter, I hear people ahead of me on trail. As I hike further down the hill, I see them! PONIES!!! A group of four ponies is hanging out. One keeps licking a boy, two are grazing, and one is sniffing the hands of the hikers around it. I join the group and get a picture with the one sniffing people's hands. üòäüòç<br>‚Ä¢<br>Rain continues to fall as I hike towards my next milestone: 500 Miles! I do my best to take pics with the sign. I can't believe I've walked so far. ‚Ä¢<br>I don't know if it's because of the rain or location, but I don't see any more ponies today. However, all the blooming rhododendron is cool. ‚Ä¢<br>My last excitement for the day is hiking through Fat Man's Squeeze. It's a small crevice/pathway between two rock slabs.

For the past few hundred miles I‚Äôve been paying attention to the elevation of shelters and tent sites. Most shelters will be in a gap or low lying place cause it‚Äôs usually closer to springs and streams, but can get humid with no breeze. Usually when i find the sites that are on ridge lines or peaks there is a little bit of a breeze. <br>Had about a 6 mile section on a ridge line infested with hard, round rocks, they were everywhere! I thought I‚Äôd be getting into Duncannon, PA about 2ish but those ROCKS were stripping my soul, üòÇüò¢. But I finally made it into town about 3:45pm and was glad i was dine for the day. The original plan was to stay at the Riverfront Campground, $5 thru hiker special with showers and right next to the river, good deal right? Wrong! This place was a crap hole, it was one of those Campgrounds that allowed long term campers and RVers. I seen a 16 foot flat bed trailer with an 8 person Ozark Trail tent and picnic table right on the trailer and looked like it‚Äôd been there for years. I said screw this and spent the $25 on a hostel in town. The Doyle Hotel is where I‚Äôm at tonight, an old turn of the century hotel with no AC, but i have an oscillating fan, ü§£üò•. Plan is to sleep in a bit then get on trail about 11am, have allot of flat sections up ahead, hopefully no more rocks, lol. Have a great night everyone.

But we'll get to that story soon. üòï<br>‚Ä¢<br>I wake up early, determined to put in 28 miles. One of the downsides/upsides of completing 42 miles in 24 hours is that now I know my body is capable of doing so. I head out at 6am. ‚Ä¢<br>The day starts off beautiful. For the first few miles or so I hike down the Virginia Creeper Trail. It's so flat, wide, and smooth; so unlike the AT. Perfect for bicycling. Damascus caters to both crowds. ‚Ä¢<br>I see orange efts along the way. I also follow the stream along the trail. The sound is relaxing. ‚Ä¢<br>Today the elevation and terrain aren't as easy, but I still make good time overall. Later on in the day it begins to rain. I get to Lost Mountain shelter and eat a late lunch. By then, I have 12 miles to go to Thomas Knob shelter. It's 3pm and that's 6 hours of hiking. I push on.<br>‚Ä¢<br>On top of the mountain between shelters, I realize I'll have to night hike for the last mile or two. I unpack my bag to get my headlamp out. As I start unpacking, I freeze. F.... comes out of my mouth and a sense of dread washes over. I have my headlamp, but I don't have my clothes bag. I forgot it at the Lost Mountain shelter 6 miles behind me. It's nearly 7pm. I'm in wet clothes, and I have to go back for it. I cry out of frustration for a couple of minutes, and pull myself together. I have to get my butt moving down that mountain. ‚Ä¢<br>I call those close to me about what is happening. My parents always get a text from me in the morning and night about where I'm going for the day, how far, and when I arrive there. After that, I begin trail running down the mountain. ‚Ä¢<br>After a couple of panic driven hours, I arrive at the shelter. I'm relieved that my clothes bag is still there and hug it to my chest. It also has my vitamins, med/hygiene kit, and a couple of sentimental items. I quickly get settled into the shelter and change into my warm, dry clothes. Today I hiked 28 miles like I'd planned. Too bad 6 of them were backwards. üôÅ But tomorrow is a new day and I'm close enough to hike to the ponies. üôÇ

I head to the library to work on videos. I get some work done, but not as much as I'd like due to slow internet/internet issues. ‚Ä¢<br>Later I head to the outfitter to buy new shoes. My Altras almost have 500 miles on them, but my feet are starting to hurt more than normal. As soon as I put on my new pair of Altras, I can feel the difference. I have cushioning again. üôÇ<br>‚Ä¢<br>Chuck Norris and Catalog cookout and invite all of us to join. It's a fantastic dinner. During this cookout, I meet a new hiker named Antman. He gets excited when he finds out my name is Runa. Apparently a couple of hikers I'd met on my 1st day on trail have been trying to catch up to me for almost a month. I find out it's Whiskey and Turkey; hikers that were doing 15 mile days at the start. Hikers that I thought were halfway to Maine already. üòÇ It's interesting how trail time works. ‚Ä¢<br>After the cookout, almost everyone heads to the bar for Green Jeans goodbye party. I try to stay, but am too tired and head back to sleep.<br>‚Ä¢<br>6/5: The rest of the tramily heads out except Green Jeans and I. I see him off when the shuttle driver picks him up. Then I head to the library to work on more videos. It's my 1st double zero and I find I can actually relax. Most of the time in town, I'm stressed out because I feel like I don't have enough to finish all my town chores, especially social media stuff. The extra workday is great for calming that stress. üôÇ<br>‚Ä¢<br>Pics:<br>1. The Virginia Creeper Trail lit up at night. <br>2. Cricket? Grasshopper?

We stick together as a group. We take mini breaks for water every hour or two, and two snacks breaks. One at a discontinued shelter McQueens Knob, but it's still a perfect place to stop. ‚Ä¢<br>My body feels great still, but I'm a nervous wreck. I had night hiked 2 miles, once before, after the sunset at Max Patch to the next shelter. I thought my wobbliness and stumbling during that night hike was due to a headlamp that wasn't powerful enough. Turns out that with fresh batteries, it's not my headlamp, but me. Even though I can see, my equilibrium is off. I'm afraid of falling off the mountain.<br>‚Ä¢<br>I make it 10 miles into our night hike doing fairly well mentally, but after that, it's a white knuckle struggle. At this point, my anxiety/fear of falling is soaring, especially when I sense any type of drop off. I talk about quitting and setting up camp at one of our breaks, but my tramily encourages me to keep going. In the end it was super helpful and worked. üòÉ But I won't ever night hike that much ever again. It's too stressful and dangerous for me.<br>‚Ä¢ <br>We make it the TN/VA border around 3 am. We're a few miles from town and finishing the challenge at this point. We take a long break to take pictures. Our headlamps light up each other as we take turns at the sign. Then Mouse Trap figures out a way to take a group photo. It was a hilarious endeavor from start to finish. üòÇ<br>‚Ä¢<br>We start hiking again, and even though it seems forever to me, we are soon into town as the sky is starting to light up. WE DID IT! Cheers of excitement. I completed mine within 23 hours, while the others completed the challenge around 21 to 22 hours.<br>‚Ä¢<br>We're all exhausted and head to the park where there is a pavilion and bathrooms. At first we were going to sleep in the pavilion for a couple of hours, but decide breakfast is more important. We hang out at the picnic table until the diner opens. ‚Ä¢<br>We did it! I did it!

Started the day out with some decent climbs and had a tight squeeze in between some huge boulder fields. After the last climb it was all downhill into the Cumberland Valley. It‚Äôs an 18 mile section of flat farmland passing through numerous towns, farms and roads. The trail went right into Boiling Springs which had a nice walk along the river and a few restaurants. Stopped into Cafe 101 for lunch and got a plate of tacos. Grabbed a few things from the gas station and headed back on trail. It was really easy walking in a very narrow trail corridor and was able to get a new PR in my total miles in a day, almost 24. Feet feel good, legs feel good and basically stopped for the day to eat dinner. Had a section that past right threw a cow pasture and all the cows were hurdled up right on the trail, (pictured) I tried walking around them about 20-30 feet away. As i got closer they bum rushed me, not scared of me at all and circled me, getting there noses all up in my personal space. I eventually used my trekking poles to keep them at a distance and started walking towards the fence. They all ended up following me, the light brown one in the picture was right up on me the whole time i was in there, kinda creepy but started laughing about it after i left the pasture, people must feed them when they roll through. Passed by a few parks with people partying and scored a beer from a group of people canoeing, winning. Ended up setting up camp at a stealth spot right off trail, decent spot with a good breeze. Have a good night everyone. Thanks for all the love and support. üèïüö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚õ∞ Hike on...<br>#2019appalachiantrailthruhike #appalachiantrail #atthruhike #atnobo2019 #georgiatomaine #at2019 #traillife #backpacking #adventureawaits #explore #exploremore #optoutdoors #thruhiker #katahdinorbust #ichallengeyoutoalloutlife #thetrek #backpackerradio #TrektheAT

They shared their wine and bourbon and dark chocolate with us. We bonded over kindred senses of humor, interest in the hiker community, and our affinity for cats. Yes, the ability to do laundry and shower and use a toilet that flushes was straight up luxurious. But the opportunity to sit in someone's living room and just enjoy an evening- that was everything! Thank you Justin and Kelly. Now we have definitive proof that not every New Yorker hates us! üòã<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #appalachianthruhike #atclassof2019 #atnobo #atnobo2019 #thruhike #optoutside #hikerhunger #hikertrash #appalachiantrail2019 #hikerfeed #tramily

Stayed the night at Michener Cabin, we set our tents up on some flat spots. It had a nice porch swing and rocking chair that was great to have my morning coffee and breakfast on. Had about a 7-8 mile hike into Pine Grove Furnace SP and man was it hot, even at 10am it was steaming. Headed to the Pine Grove general store and partaked in the thru hiker tradition of the half gallon ice cream challenge, i made it about halfway before i felt like crap and quit, ordered a BLTA wrap and fries instead, ü§£üôÑ. We sat there for a few hours and enjoyed the food. About 2:30pm the clouds rolled in and got a pretty nasty storm, heavy rain, thunder and some hail. While we waited for that to clear out i took a shower and got all that nasty sweat off me, felt amazing. About 5pm the storm had cleared and brought the temp down about 10 degrees, but brought the humidity up with it. Hiked about 8-9 more miles to James Fry Shelter and set up camp by the stream. It‚Äôs raining at the moment and can hear music from a house not to far away, someone is partying tonight, should go ask them for a beer, üòéüçª. Have a great night everyone.

Woop woop! Had a pretty good night, got a little humid but by 4am it had started to cool off. Got back on trail about 8am and headed into Caledonia State Park. Right before that was Hwy 30 that headed into Fayetteville. Meet up with Sarge and headed to a restaurant called Bonfire for lunch which was 0.6 miles into town. We got there and noticed it was closed for renovations, which sucked cause it was the only restaurant on that side of town. After a shirt deliberation we decided to hit up the Flamingo restaurant about 2 miles into town. The only reason we even thought about it was that the road we were on was pretty busy and thought a hitch back to the trail would be pretty easy. We stopped at the Dollar General to do a quick resupply before heading to the restaurant. We got to the Flamingo and stuffed our faces, they had some really good food, i drank like 6 glasses of Diet Cokes, the thirst quencher. We walked back to the gas station which was a half mile back towards the trail and scored a ride. A very nice lady and her two daughters were heading to Caledonia State Park in their Westfalia, VW and were kind enough to give us a ride. As we were grabbing our stuff out of the van at the trail, Sarge noticed he had forgotten his trekking poles at the gas station, she was super nice and went back to grab them, as she was leaving a guy in a dodge pickup pulled behind her and gave her the gas cap she had forgotten at the gas station, ü§£. This day was an adventure guys, it was hilarious. We headed into Caledonia to fill up with water, which was right next to a pool and meet a few other thru hikers we‚Äôd been leapfrogging with. Eventually headed out and got about 0.2 miles up trail and hit some trail magic, i was still full from lunch but the lady was super nice so we talked for about 15 minutes. FINALLY got out of Caledonia about 2pm and had about 13 miles to the shelter, that place was a vortex, we almost just took a nero, üòÇ. Made the 1000ft climb out of the gap and was drenched in sweat, today had to of been the hottest day yet, everything was soaked. Made it to the shelter in one peace.

HELLO Pennsylvania... how you doin? (Joey tribbiani voice). 6 states down, 8 more to see. Camped at a pretty sweet shelter last night, actually all the shelters since harpers ferry of been really nice, flat tent pads with picnic table and fire pit, 2 level shelters, the privies have been on another level. Made it to Penmar State Park about 10am which was right before the MD/PA state border, they usually have the concession stands open but not today, üòî. Dealt with allot of rocks and boulders in sections but then would be on a nice flat pine needle trail, walking on pine needles is like walking on carpet, could do that all day. Got into Old Forge Picnic Area about 2pm, just before the last climb of the day. Was greeted with some trail magic by a man that attempted the AT last year, he said he got about 900 miles in and the knees were done, so he comes back every year and knocks iff sections of it, super cool dude. I had a few hot dogs, some chips and an ice cold coca cola, just in time for the last climb, ü§£. Got up the last climb pretty smoothly but just drenched in sweat, temp showed 96 and no wind, üôÑ. Made sure to drink plenty of water throughout the day, if I‚Äôm still sweating I‚Äôm good. Made my way into Rocky Mtn Shelter about 6:30pm and set up camp.

Everyone in camp was up and going by 6am and didn‚Äôt want to be the last man out. Got up and out the door by 7am, the hottest part of the day is afternoon into evening so it was good to get going when it was cooler. About a mile up trail was greeted with three ice filled coolers with sodas, redbulls and beers, felt it was too early for a beer so went with the redbull, ended up paying for that decision, üòÇ. Got about 9 miles done by 11am to Black Rock Cliffs (pictured), sat and had lunch with an awesome view of Maryland. We‚Äôve been passing through a very narrow trail corridor the past few days. Been going through or around people‚Äôs backrards, over interstate highways and farm land, the change of scenery has been nice though. Made it into Raven Rock Shelter about 5pm and set up camp. The water source here sucks, about 0.4 miles down a steep, STEEP side trail, but it had a good flow and was able to fill up. From the sounds of it we aren‚Äôt to far outside a city/town, been hearing police sirens, trains and vehicles not to far away, like i said ‚Äúvery narrow trail corridor‚Äù. Body and mind are doing good, the right knee has been a little tight the past few days but nothing painful, just letting me know it‚Äôs there. No rain, No pain, No Maine! üí™üòé.

And I know it isn't LNT. I'll just leave this here... Blue's breathtaking cairn which he stopped to assemble mostly by himself (only the bottom few rocks were there when he stopped by.) The fog makes it perfect. I freaked out when he showed me this. I always look forward to his nightly "show and tell" from the pictures of his hike. I know it probably gets old how I think everything is important or everything means something. But part of what I love about this picture is how it reflects him so well. Strong, careful, patient, gentle, intricate. I think I'm just in love.

Eating lunch in the van. Views of tires and tourists and locals and parking lots. Awkwardly sitting on the ground outside public buildings to shamelessly charge our devices. Reading/writing and self-entertainment of any kind. Not pictured: being stared at by children, getting yelled at by drivers, and many trips to Wal-Mart and gas stations. Not able to be pictured because it is too intangible: feeling restless and sedentary. Missing my husband. Missing the sweat and endorphins on the trail. Missing a sense of accomplishment. Missing the woods and everything quiet and natural. Learning to accept that I thought I could walk 2,192 miles, but I can't. Feeling guilty that because of me, my husband is walking alone. This hike, for me, didn't end up being about what my body can do. It ended up being about what my spirit can do, and what our relationship can do. And when I'm having a good day and not feeling self-absorbed, I can admit that that is a very beautiful and awesome thing. Today, my husband will have walked over 1,400 on his own two precious feet. I am so proud of him.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #appalachianthruhike #atclassof2019 #atnobo #atnobo2019 #thruhike #optoutside #hikerhunger #hikertrash #appalachiantrail2019 #hikerfeed #marriage #support #teamwork #honest

Stayed at the Teahorse Hiker Hostel last night, slept pretty good but felt like i was tossing and turning all night. The host of the hostel made us waffles about 8am, which were delicious, then headed back on trail. Followed the C&O Canal Towpath for about 3 miles, was a super flat, double wide, gravel trail along the Potomac River. This was where we crossed into Maryland but didn‚Äôt see a border sign, so this AT Maryland trail map is my WVA/MA sign, ü§£ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Had about 1000ft climb coming out of Harpers Ferry which was a cake walk with fresh legs. Past by Gathland State Park (pictured) which had a few War Correspondents Monuments. Got up to White Rock Cliffs (pictured) about 2:30pm and had a little snack with a great view, had a bunch of day hikers on this section of trail, decent views. Maryland doesn‚Äôt allow any stealth camping so it‚Äôs either shelters or designated camping spots, kinda messes with how many miles i can do in a day. Got into Dahlgren Backpack Campground about 5:15pm, it‚Äôs free with pretty nice tent pads, individual fire pit and own picnic table, plus a bathroom with hot showers, ‚ò∫Ô∏èüòÅ. Weather app isn‚Äôt shower any rain for the next week but will be in the mid 90‚Äôs, with humidity it‚Äôs gunna get sweaty. Have a good night everyone.

Last night i set up my tent at the Bears Den Hostel and ate entirely too much, so much so that i was uncomfortable, i guess 2 pizzas, 2 pints of ice cream and numerous chocolate chip cookies was more than my stomach could manage, ü§£ü§¢. Woke up at 7am and had a plate full of pancakes made by this sweet young Italian girl, she is hiking the AT for the summer until college starts. Got back on trail and finished out the last 1/4 of the Rollercoaster, glad that‚Äôs over, just going up and down some pretty steep and rocky grade. Met allot of trail runners on this section training for races around here, would definitely make a great training area if i lived around here, would help train for those obstacle course races, üòé. After those 6 miles it was pretty flat but still had allot if rocks and roots to contend with. Met a young Japanese hiker named ‚Äúsketch‚Äù on top of Crescent Rock which had a nice view. He was sitting up there painting a picture of it in a little book he had been carrying since springer, his whole book was of views and places he has been while hiking the AT, they were amazing paintings. Got into 4 mile tent site which is 4 miles outside Harpers Ferry and should be getting in there early tomorrow morning. I‚Äôm not sure if i want to take a zero or just stop in for a bit, we‚Äôll see tomorrow if the weather looks good, saying rain for most of the day. Legs are feeling good and ankles are yelling at me with all the rocks lately, but they‚Äôll manage. Happy Sunday everyone.

A woman who shaves her head when she realizes her long hair is the only reason she feels pretty. An inherently spiritual and philosophical person. Intuitive, a feeler, an introvert, but also a social butterfly around the right people. I am eager to laugh. Easily angered by loud chewing and people who are not self-aware. I hate bugs and small talk. I'm compelled to do things I'm afraid of, but totally not an adrenaline seeker. I enjoy writing and cooking and many other forms of art and self-expression. I am not easily persuaded or convinced of anything. I lack self-discipline for goals that are imposed on me, but I'm a tidal wave when I decide there's something I want to accomplish. One of my favorite feelings in the world is generating hospitality: watching friends fill their bellies with a meal that I made and drinks that I poured, sitting on my floor, laughing and telling their stories. My favorite smells are pine needles in the dirt baked by hours of sunlight, and warm concrete after a summer rain. I love to dance, be around strong women, and smoke cigars in the winter time. I am a romantic and an optimist and the happiest wife in the world. I get quiet and withdrawn when I'm angry and I hate conflict when I'm not the one who started it. I'm an overly confident driver and I sing insults to make my road rage less ugly. At home, I'm a speech-language pathologist. Out here, I'm a human being in her natural habitat. But most importantly, I'm also really bad at basketball. .<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #appalachianthruhike #atclassof2019 #atnobo #atnobo2019 #thruhike #optoutside #hikerhunger #hikertrash #appalachiantrail2019 #hikerfeed #tramily #womenwhohike

From Blue's perspective, Pennsylvania will be remembered as a difficult state in most regards. Mentally it was a slump. Physically it was as rocky as everyone says it is. He is so strong and proving to be quite the impressive hiker, but those rocks left his feet tender and his shoes worn down and shredded just like everyone else. Trail legs were acquired long ago. The honeymoon phase wore off long ago. Now it is solely a mental game... one I would like to say he is winning, even if it isn't always easy. We really enjoy our little van home. We keep it clean and organized, and it's become our own private oasis. Something we both look forward to every day. I am finding ways to do short hikes on my own or with Blue when I can. It helps me to cope with the grieving process a bit. I don't really enjoy spending a lot of time driving. Selfishly, it isn't what I came out here to do. So it's been a growth period for me to learn about how to help out other hikers while also keeping my own boundaries and priorities in check. No offense to any of you Yankees, but the drivers up here are absolutely vicious at times. It was a culture shock to go from the trail, where you see the best in people, to the roads, where you see the worst in people. But the forest is never far. I enjoy supporting my husband on this amazing feat. I look forward to making fun dinners, hanging out outside the van, and seeing his pictures from the day. Can you believe that he was dropped off in Georgia, and walked all the way up to New York? He amazes me. Katahdin is his, if he wants it. .<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #appalachianthruhike #atclassof2019 #atnobo #atnobo2019 #thruhike #optoutside #hikerhunger #hikertrash #appalachiantrail2019 #hikerfeed #tramily #candid #thegood #thebad #theugly

He doesn't silence his phone at night because he wants to be available if a friend should need his help. You are lucky if he is your friend, because that means you have a friend for life. Blue is a luthier and woodworker who loves to work with his hands. To take materials and concentration and time to create something that didn't exist before. When he builds, he applies careful hands and tedious attention. It truly is his happy place. Blue has incredible integrity. He will complete any task to meet his own high standards- regardless of what that task is or who will ever (or never) notice. He doesn't cut corners. He is a sincere and gentle soul. An intuitive observer of others. An impressive problem solver. Cuddly and loud after a few fingers of bourbon. Playful, hilarious, and lighthearted like a child, but cantakerous and point-blank like an old man. He is determined to never let chivalry die. He thinks we should all spend more time barefoot. He wishes children were still required to learn cursive. He roots for underdogs. He wishes men communicated their feelings more freely. He wishes women would stop trying so hard to be pretty. He will try (or eat) just about anything with little need for persuasion. He won't hesitate to be countercultural if it aligns with his values. He enjoys stirring the pot- antagonizing friends in good humor or ruthlessly playing devil's advocate in a long debate, only to reveal that he agrees with you at the end of it. He is a man of few (but valuable) words. He is ridiculously attractive. And the best damn hugger you ever met. He is my home, my playmate, my Katahdin. But most importantly, he really sucks at basketball. .<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #appalachianthruhike #atclassof2019 #atnobo #atnobo2019 #thruhike #optoutside #hikerhunger #hikertrash #appalachiantrail2019 #hikerfeed #love #marriage #soulmate #admiration

On our way we see an orange eft, which is a juvenile eastern newt. A section hiker tells us that they stay orange for a year and then turn a darker color and are more aquatic as adults. ‚Ä¢<br>We also find what looks like an old log cabin, but when I take a closer look inside, I see remnants of hay. I'm not 100% sure what the building was used for, bit it was neat to explore around it. ‚Ä¢<br>Laurel Falls is beautiful and we find Chuck Norris there as he's leaving. We chat for a bit and settle in to eat. Originally we thought about swimming here, but it's way too chilly, at least for me. But a couple of people who arrive after us do. I'm glad they're having fun.<br>‚Ä¢<br>As we eat, little butterflies are floating around. One keeps landing on us and our stuff strewn everywhere. I try my best to take pics when it lands on my hand. üòä<br>‚Ä¢<br>The hike out of the falls is a bit sketchy for a few feet where you have to navigate a narrow path next to the river. The rocks are wet from the rain earlier  in the day. Green Jeans leads the way and we both make it. ‚Ä¢<br>We continue on towards Boots Off Hostel, and manage to get the last two bunks in the bunkhouse. As soon as I see my bunk, this place becomes my favorite bunkhouse on the AT. We have our own light, plug for charging electronics, a shelf area, sheets, pillow, AND...a privacy curtain. I loved my little pink cave. For the first time I actually sleep well in a bunkhouse. üòä<br>‚Ä¢<br>1&2. Laurel Falls <br>3. Old log cabin or barn?<br>4. Laurel Creek after the Falls<br>5.

I don't go to breakfast and try to wait patiently for everyone to return. My original plan was to hike 18 miles today, but with the late start, that's impossible now.<br>‚Ä¢<br>I finally get back on trail and start my day. I hike through lots of meadows. I stop by Isaac's Cemetery because I like headstone artwork. I'm hoping to see some from the 1800s, and the cemetery has quite a few. They even have anonymous headstones that say: Unknown. A rarity. I think this is the first time I've seen one.<br>‚Ä¢<br>Today is waterfall day since we pass two bigger ones on trail. I take a long snack break at Jones Falls. The sound of the falls is calming. Later on, I stop briefly at Mountaineer Falls. It's smaller than Jones Falls, but still neat to watch.<br>‚Ä¢<br>At the Mountaineer shelter, I wait for some tramily members to head in. I want to hike a  few more miles, but most of them want to stay there because it matches their hiking plans better for the next day. Green Jeans arrives, and since we both want to hike more, we head out towards mile 411 where there's a campsite. It's a 16 mile day. Close enough to my original 18 that I had planned. üòâ<br>‚Ä¢<br>Before leaving the shelter, Green Jeans was talking about trail challenges. The 24 hour hiking challenge was brought up in conversation with Mouse Trap, North Star, him, and I. This challenge is to see how far you can hike in 24 hours, but we choose a 42 mile stretch from Guthooks/AWOL's Guide. We're excited because it looks like the terrain coming up is a perfect spot to attempt it. It'll be a day or two before we're at the spot to begin this. We can't wait! üòÄ<br>‚Ä¢<br>Pics<br>1&2. 400 Miles!!!<br>3. Love the lone dead tree silhouette in the sky. <br>4. View of the day<br>5. Isaac's cemetery <br>6-8. Jones Falls <br>8&9. River on today's hike. The water was so clear by the shore!

We met him back on Blue Mountain in Georgia, where he also coincidentally met most of his tramily. Rhythm and his buds have hung together across several states. Theirs was the first tramily Blue and I saw form on the trail. It was always inspiring to us to see how they managed to respect each other and take care of each other with a true sense of community and togetherness, yet still hike their own hikes. Although some of his tramily members might be behind or ahead of him- or at home healing from injuries- Rhythm will never be alone. He is a fun and charismatic dude who makes friends easily. Many hikers on the AT, even some who haven't met him, have enjoyed his hilarious comments in Guthooks (which were all deleted and blocked by the way.. come on Guthooks?!) Rhythm is also a certified sommelier (basically a wine expert) and plays the upright bass. Despite his classy hobbies, Rhythm is a very down to earth and laid back guy. We are glad we got to meet him and his tramily on the trail! .<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #appalachianthruhike #atclassof2019 #atnobo #atnobo2019 #thruhike #optoutside #hikerhunger #hikertrash #appalachiantrail2019 #hikerfeed #tramily

Your views were good, the wildlife wasn‚Äôt afraid and you trails were flat, next time I‚Äôm going through on motorcycle, üòÇ. I made it out of the Shenandoah‚Äôs in the morning and was instantly greeted with the AT I remembered, rocks, roots and overgrowth, didn‚Äôt slow me down any, üí™. Passed by US 522 and was greeted with a cooler full of cold pepsis, they were no coke but it still did the trick. Walked up trail about 100 yards and sitting under the trailhead sign was a cold 12 pack of good ole PBRs, so i had me one of them also, üòÇü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. I left a note on both thanking whoever left such kindness. Had a decent climb up to Manassas Gap Shelter, maybe 1000ft. Ended up passing by a few day hikers while heading up, one guy asked how i did it, told him, hike 9am to 6pm everyday for 3 months and your legs will literally turn into thoroughbred stallion legs, ü§£üôÑ. The next shelter was about 5 miles past manassas shelter, i filled up with water anticipating maybe a tent site would show up between here and there. Well that didn‚Äôt happen, not one tent site in 5 miles, ü§¨. Got into Dicks Dome Shelter about 7:15pm and my feet were done, all the ricks today had them swearing at me. Clear skies tonight so have my clothes hanging up to dry, hopefully that was a good decision, ü§û. Have a good night everyone.

I kept the vestibules open on my tent to allow a little but if wind to come through and watched all the lightning bugs do there sexy dance. Out here with very little artificial lighting these little guys could light up my tent, super bright. I‚Äôve been using 2 packets of coffee in the morning, üò≤ mixed with some chocolate instant carnations just for that little extra push, ü§™, seems to be working. Got into Elkwallow Wayside (store) about 11:30am and had a meatball sub with cheddar cheese fries, SNP is really spoiling me with these stores every 20 miles. Past over Skyline 18.8, watched a bear cross the road. Hiked up South Marshal Mtn, seen a black bear down by the spring, maybe 100 yards. Was hiking up to Compton Peak, was about half way up and on my left was a cliff with a great view and on my right a boulder which the AT circled to continue up to the peak, took my picture at the cliff and continued on, got around the boulder and climbed some stairs, my attention was on my feet, head was down and was using my poles to help my legs, i get about 6 steps up and look over to my right and this black bear, maybe 4-5 years old is like 10 feet away from me, he/she didn‚Äôt give two craps i was there. I jumped and yelled ‚Äúholly shit‚Äù what i thought was pretty loudly and it didn‚Äôt even faze him/her. I walked slowly up trail and the bear turned it‚Äôs head like meh, and walked off, üò≥. Pretty crazy I‚Äôve seen more bears in the SNP than any other place along the AT and the SNP has people everywhere. After that i made my way to the next campsite and called it a day. Feet are a little sore from the rocks but other than that don‚Äôt feel to bad, think the bodies getting used to 20 mile days. Have a good night all.

She‚Äôs a flip flop hiker who covered 1400 miles last year and is finishing the trail this year. She started about 3 weeks ago in Pine Furnace and aims to finish in the Whites. Had a really interesting chat and what‚Äôs nice is that this year she‚Äôs taking the time to enjoy the journey rather than clicking up the mileage .....

Stayed at the Big Meadows Campground last night, had a family with a 1 yr old baby that apparently was hungry at 4:30 in the morning, üòÇüôÑ. Had another hot humid day and sweated my arse off, luckily the climbs are pretty easy on this section of trail. Stopped into the Skyland Resort & Restaurant for a bite to eat about 1pm, luckily i did cause we got a hell of a rain storm that passed by, had a good downpour for about 15 minutes. Headed out and began the little climb up to The Pinnacle (pictured) and had an awesome view of the Virginia countryside. Made my way down to Thornton Gap where this dude was waiting for me, FRED, life long family friend but definitely more like family at this point. Haven‚Äôt seen him much since joining the military but was so good to sit, chat and catch up on life, thanks for taking time out of your day to come see me brotha, appreciate it, üòä. After that i quickly made the 2 mile climb up to Pass Mtn Hut, as we were talking in the parking lot we seen a set of nasty looking clouds rumbling our way, the whole way up i could here them getting closer. Got to the hut just in time for the rain, waited it out for a bit then set out to get the tent up. Gunna chill here for the night and might do a little hiking in the morning, I don‚Äôt know, we‚Äôll see what happens, ü§£üôÑ.

Well today wasn‚Äôt one of those days, üòÇü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Woke up feeling great, which was a shocker considering how much I‚Äôve hiked the past few days. Had a guy about 15ft away from my tent and could here everything, he was talking in his sleep pretty loudly, from the buts and pieces i picked up it sounded like he was nervous about taking a test, maybe college, I don‚Äôt know but it was weird, ü§£. About 4 miles on trail i came up on a black bear, i was making a climb and was turning left up the hill, i had to have been 20ft away before he ran, he was small but not small enough for momma to be around. I stopped, looked around to see if she was around but it was just him. He ran up the hill a little ways, maybe 70ft, i could still see him clear as day. I started to walk up trail and he just watched me, didn‚Äôt seem scared, more curious of me than anything. Got into Lewis Mtn Wayside about 2pm and had my an ice cold coca cola and sandwich. The temp today was allot cooler than yesterday, i sweated my arse off yesterday, still humid today but not as steamy. It was getting late in the day so I started looking for good tent sites, of course i had no water so i had to wait till the next spring. Found an awesome site on top of Hazletop Mtn but had no water, almost said screw the water the site was so good, ü§®. Got water a few miles up trail and wouldn‚Äôt you know it, not a single tent site to be found, figures. Got to Big Meadows Campground about 6:45pm, it was either walk another 2 hours to the shelter or pay $15 for a site, my feet were done so i went with the tent site. Got a shower, laundry and an ice cold coca cola, üòé. Today was a good day. Have a great day everyone.

And all because of a tree branch that threw him off balance just enough to send him tumbling. It wasn't about his will power or his ability to hike. Our hike is a series of millions of steps, and it only takes one- the wrong one- to end it. No matter how tough, how young, or how healthy you are. For me, it was that I started my hike in the wrong pair of shoes. And eventually the problems it caused grew so severe that I had to call it. How could I have known? I'm thankful for the time Iron Man and I spent together the last few days. Talking about how possessed we are- and always will be- by these white blazes. How psychologically challenging it can be to focus daily on accomplishing a goal through every kind of adversity, only to have something totally unexpected and out of your control take it away. This trail is teaching me hundreds of lessons. I thought I knew what the trail would  teach me, but I was wrong. I've learned about determination and perseverance, yes. But most thru-hikers start with those lessons pretty well learned, don't we? What we don't expect to learn is humility, surrender, flexibility, and resilience as we bounce back from failure. Iron Man- you haven't failed any more than I have. We are simply learning lessons we didn't expect to learn. These lessons are hard AF, but beautiful too. Heal and come back to tap these blazes, brother. Everyone is rooting for you.

Got to the Loft Mtn Store just before noon, charged up my phone and had lunch while i waited. SNP has campgrounds next to Skyline Dr and mist have a general store with it. This one was nice, showers for $1.75 for 5 minutes, laundry room and fully stocked with ice cream. Headed out about 1pm and headed up to Blackrock Overlook, it was a huge boulder that had been worn away over time and made the entire mountain full of boulders. Met a few families on trail heading north, but nowhere near what i saw yesterday, pretty quite. Headed past Simmons Gap and past that 900 mile marker BOI, at this pace I‚Äôll hit the 1000 by this weekend, üí™. Got into Hightop Hut about 6:30pm, not as full as the last one but probably around 10-12 people. Getting a few rain showers at the moment but should clear out here shortly. Gunna sleep good tonight, i can feel it. Have a good night everyone. Thanks for all the love and support. üèïüö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚õ∞ Hike on...<br>#2019appalachiantrailthruhike #appalachiantrail #atthruhike #atnobo2019 #georgiatomaine #at2019 #traillife #backpacking #adventureawaits #explore #exploremore #optoutdoors #thruhiker #katahdinorbust #ichallengeyoutoalloutlife #thetrek #backpackerradio

Hardly any roots, very little rocks and the climbs i could almost laugh at, well groomed and well maintained means i can put myself on autopilot and go, üòÜ. Steve (a local trail angel) dropped me of at Rockfish Gap about 10ish and not to far up trail was the Shenandoah self registration box for backcountry permits. I had my new shoes on and could already feel my feet hurting, need to break these suckers in quick. The AT went back and forth with Skyline Drive allowing for some decent views at the parking lots, not much for views on the AT. Ran into ALLOT of day hikers who were heading south, i kinda felt like a celebrity, everyone would ask ‚Äúhey, you thru hiking?‚Äù Ide say ‚Äúyes‚Äù, then it was the 20 questions. Met allot of previous thru hikers and got complimented a few times on how small my pack was,ü§£, feels heavy as sh!t to me, üòÇ. Met a couple from Anoka, MN, they were down here for vacation, sat and chatted with them for awhile. The last 5 miles to the shelter was rough, feet had had enough of the new shoes, guess doing 20 miles the first day wasn‚Äôt such a good idea, üòé no blisters though, so were good.

Bubbles earned her trail name because she is so effervescent, warm, and joyful. Her laugh fills the room with light. Bubbles is an intelligent, independent, and hospitable southern sweetheart. Her husband (Halo) is hiking the AT and was the first member of our tramily. But Halo could not conquer such a dream if it weren't for Bubbles holding down all the responsibilities at home. She keeps many plates spinning while she also takes care of her father full-time. But somehow in the mix of her busy schedule, Bubbles finds time to plan elaborate gestures to show Halo how much she cares about his journey and how proud she is of him. She planned ahead to have cake and signs waiting for Halo and his crew at the ATC in Harper's Ferry to congratulate him on making it halfway. She puts together picture albums of his hike so he can cherish the memories long after Katahdin. She rallies friends and their Church community at home, not just to help Halo along, but also to support his tramily and provide trail magic for many other hikers along the way. Bubbles has a refreshing and lively sense of humor and is a blast to be around. Her heart is deep and wide. We have been loved so genuinely by her. And when you are loved by Bubbles, you are a lucky one indeed.

She earned her trail name on her second day-hike on the Appalachian Trail, as Sunshine noticed her admiring and petting the ferns on more than one occasion. Fern's second time on the AT was a lot more peaceful than the first. The first time she walked between the white blazes, she was in the Smokies with her husband with the intention of doing a looped day-trail. Well, as we know, the AT will take you straight to Maine if you let it. She and her husband walked 8 miles before they had the daunting realization that they would have to turn around and walk those same 8 miles back to their car. But this time, Fern did a portion of the AT on purpose and loved every second of it. She is a nurse of 30 years with a hippie heart who loves to garden and spend time with her hubby and fur babies. She loves glitter and the color blue. She thinks trees are sexy when they sway in the wind. When we thanked her for being willing to drive 900 miles to visit us, she said: "well, I didn't drive as many miles as you walked!" Fern is kind, a lover of all things lovely, and a person who welcomes new experiences in a fashion that will keep her forever young.

This picture actually captures him pretty well. He is a tough dude (note the recently broken arm and stoic expression) but also a true softy (note the "happy birthday" crown he tried to wear in honor of Sunshine, but ended up wearing it as a choker instead because it wouldn't stay on). Iron Man is 25 years married with one kid, and has a very supportive mother we all call "Iron Mom." Iron Man got his trail name because of his long career in an iron foundry. But he is a man of steel. He was diagnosed with a progressive disease called Ankylosing Spondylitis. This disease causes his joints to progressively fuse together until they are no longer mobile. He had a hard time accepting this diagnosis. But eventually he decided that it ultimately meant the best time for the AT is NOW. He was inspired to do the AT when he was doing a shakedown hike in Pennsylvania and saw a female thru hiker with one arm climbing out of Lehigh gap (a 1000ft hand-over-hand rock climb) as if it was nothing. He thought: "if she can do it, I can do it." As he walks between the blazes, his fusing joints are cracking back open again, and again, and again. Thru-hiking is painful, but Iron Man's baseline of daily pain is much higher than ours. He has our respect because he can break his arm in two places and then still go out to enjoy a pasta dinner and ice cream on the same day. He has our respect because he can fend off an aggressive bear in the Shenandoahs. But most importantly, he has our respect because he is a kind and giving soul who takes care of the people around him.

I don't think I've ever felt so genuinely celebrated by others as I did today. My cheeks are sore from laughing. My heart is overflowing with true love for each of these hikers, angels, and family around us. I feel swallowed up by a community of selflessly loving, endlessly giving, hilarious, wholesomely GOOD people. I've been surprised by pie. Prayed for. Gifted with sweet and thoughtful trinkets. Verbally encouraged and lifted up. Pedicured. Celebrated. Seen and enjoyed. I'm feeling truly humbled to be so loved. This was my favorite birthday so far. And I hope it is the kickstart of a year that  continues on with the momentum of the trail- community, kindness, adventure, peace, joy. ‚ô•Ô∏è<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #appalachianthruhike #atclassof2019 #atnobo #atnobo2019 #thruhike #optoutside #hikerhunger #hikertrash #appalachiantrail2019 #hikerfeed #happybirthday #sunshine #bluegrass #tramily #grateful

Had a cold front move through about 10pm creating some massive wind, some if the gusts were so strong i was fearing a Branch would land on my noggin, which had me up most of the night, üôÑ. Woke up about 7:30am and cooked breakfast in my sleeping bag, it had to have gotten down into the 40s, good sleeping weather but damn cold for a good breakfast, ü§£. Quickly packed up and got back on trail just to stay warm and get the blood flowing. Had about 12 miles till waynesboro and i booked it, got those 12 miles done by 1:30pm, üí™ the motivation of food was real. The town of waynesboro is very hiker friendly with an Appalachian thru hikers pavilion right in town, you can set up your tent in the park for free (three day max), have a solar charging station (doesn‚Äôt work) and can head over to the YMCA for a free shower (towel and soap provided), it‚Äôs a pretty nice set up. Went over to the local laundromat and did laundry in the sketchy part of town, üòÇ they never have them on the good side, lol. After i got all my chores done, finally went over to the Ming Garden Buffet and stuffed my face, $12 dolla all you can eat, it was AMAZING. It feels like my body doesn‚Äôt know what to do with all this food and just shuts down, it was a long walk back to camp, ü§£ü§¢. I swear I don‚Äôt plan this, but looks like this weekend is Waynesboro‚Äôs trail days fest and are having soapbox car races tomorrow, totally checking that out, don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever witnessed one of those. Gunna be a good night, just laying down and gunna watch some Netflix. Have a good night all.

Had a great nights sleep, got a little chilly but curled up in the sleeping bag and was nice and warm. Took my time tearing down camp and git on trail about 9ish, really liking getting a later start but hiking later in the day. Had some pretty easy terrain today, mainly rolling hills between 3-4 thousand feet. Could really tell the trail crews were putting in their time on this section, allot of the overgrowth was cut down and made fir easy walking. Made the climb up to The Priest (pictured) but it was the downhill after that was hard on the feet. Had almost a 3000ft downhill to the Tye River, knees and hips were really sore after that, was almost wishing for some uphill, almost, ü§£. Met a group of 7 heading south for a section hike while getting water, they had to climb up what i was going down, i wished them luck, üí™. Made another 1000ft climb up to Harpers Creek Shelter late in the day and pitched my tent at the tent site just before it. They have enough room for probably20 tents but I‚Äôm the only on here, they‚Äôre right next to the creek which is nice. Supposed to rain a little tonight but nothing major. Legs and feet feel excellent even with the high miles.

Set up camp next to Brown Mountain Creek and fell sound asleep to the sound of flowing water, might have made me had to pee a few times also, üòÇ. Woke up to blue skies with a nice breeze and got back on trail. Had about a 4 mike hike to Long mountain Wayside parking lot, meet a huge group of kids from the YMCA out for a day hike, had to of been 30 of them. Tried for about an hour to call for a ride into town, i had no service and when i did it wasn‚Äôt enough to call out, but i had 4g LTE, üôÑ. Finally a few hikers came by and let me use there phone, went into town and got some snacks for a few more days. Got back on trail about 2pm and made the 2500ft climb up Bald Knob, which isn‚Äôt actually a bald, üôÑ. After coming down from that we had a beautiful section of trail through some open prairie, was nice to see some views for a change. Made it into Hog Camp Gap about 4pm that has a bunch of tent sites in a grassy meadow, it‚Äôs right next to a popular parking lot so there‚Äôs allot of people here. On my way to get water i seen a trail crew with about 30 people set up just down the hill, they have a few canopies set up with a few grills and coolers. I took everything out of my pack and laid it out to dry, really didn‚Äôt take long with the sun beating down on it. Met an old japanese guy with the trail name Rising Sun, barely speaks any English, just enough to get by, super cool dude though. Gunna lay down and enjoy this sun while i can.

Really getting tired of this rain, pretty much rained all night and all morning. Finally got a break around 9:30am, enough to quickly break down the tent and head out. At this point the tent is wet, shoes have been soaked and sleeping bag is pretty damp, doing all i can to keep everything dry, but 4 days of this it‚Äôs been pretty tough. Started the day out with a 2400ft climb up to Big Rocky Row, if the rain didn‚Äôt have me drenched the sweat sure did, that was a tough climb. Had a few other little climbs going up Bluff Mtn, Punchbowl Mtn and Rice Mtn. Shortly after that i hit the big ole 800 mile marker, seems like it took forever with these last few days. With the wet socks, shoes and clothes, been getting some nasty chafing, especially on the feet and groin. Stopped a few times to apply tape over chafed areas but really the best thing is to get everything dry. Weather app is shower sunny skies and around 70 tomorrow, woohoo. Gunna head into town and do a quick resupply in the morning, then try an find a place to camp early in the day to dry this stuff out, I‚Äôm over being wet all day.

Slept pretty good last night but with all the rain everything was damp. Slept in until 8:30am, looked at my phone to see what time it was at shocked me, had to do a double take. Got up and quickly tore down the wet tent and continued on. Luckily since i did all that climbing yesterday, mist of today was downhill. It rained for most of the morning until about noon, the wind gusts had died down also so it wasn‚Äôt blowing all the water off the trees. Made it up to Highcock Knob which was the biggest climb for the day, about 800ft. Got into Matts Creek Shelter and had a snack, the trail follows Matts Creek for a bit after that until we cross over the James River. This is the longest foot use only bridge along the AT, not sure how long it was, had allot of day hikers checking it out. Tried to get a ride into town but everyone was going the other way and had no cell signal to call for one, so i just headed back on trail and hit up the next shelter. Not to much going on today, had a few views that were whited out but mainly just walking with a purpose. Tomorrow is supposed ü§ûto be the last of this all day rain, need to see the sun and dry out all my gear.

Injuries happen and you can't schedule recovery any better than you can schedule the injury itself. The van is our home and we enjoy it! We recently got drawers to organize our food better and spent a good half day arranging everything to be as clean and efficient as possible. Bluegrass has encountered some rocks and rock mazes on the trail, but for the most part it hasn't been too bad yet. Lots of flat and beautiful farm land and some boardwalks. He's been a hiking machine through every obstacle. And we are near many hikers we know and love. While he may not get to camp with them every night, seeing them on the trail and in towns has been awesome. Halo is close to catching us after leaving trail for a wedding, and many others such as Q, RG, Stingray, Iron Man, Rhythm, Nibbles and Radar, Spruce Lee and Shiitake, Mighty Mouse and Which Way, Roo, (the list goes on...) they are never far!

Sometimes that involves a shuttle or picking up a package, or handing out sodas and snacks, or writing inspirational phrases with pebbles, or cleaning a hostel from head to toe. No matter what it is, we find that the more you give the more you get. That isn't why we are doing it, but it's an amazing law of nature to find yourself in the middle of. We've been honored guests in people's homes enjoying wine and games and birthday cakes, stumbled upon secret bars in small towns with $1.50 beers... it's been a blast. What it comes down to is that we love living our lives with each other, whatever that looks like. Making decisions together is easy and we are a strong team. We are so grateful to all the hikers and angels we know who genuinely support our journey even though it isn't as "purist" as we originally intended. You all have been so kind and uplifting, and it means the world.

We used to worry about heavy packs, the weather, water, etc. Insead, now we are feeling lonely, alienated, and conflicted with our identities as hikers. Sunshine feels less included now that she is off trail and traded her stinky pack for a set of keys. People don't immediately look at her and know she is a hiker, which is unexpectedly  hard. Now her "hike" has a strange caviat... An explanation that has to be given many times a day when people see the van. And its a very sad conversation to have over and over again- explaining why she isn't walking. She passes up trail magic and doesn't feel welcome to it anymore. She notices her leg muscles getting softer and weight coming back. She tried to do squats but her knees weren't having it, and her feet are still in too much pain to do any substantial day-hiking. So she's trying to limit calories with a hiker hunger that hasn't subsided yet. She is hangry and forced to be sedentary, and feeling very frustrated in her own body... Missing the woods terribly. Blue might see people he knows on the trail, but he isn't ending his day with them at the same camps or shelters. And that is where most of the visiting and social aspects of the trail take place. Instead he is hiking to parking lots and gaps. He struggles with feeling like he isn't a thru-hiker because of the amenities of the van and slackpacking every day. He even put his AT tag on his slack pack so he might avoid some of the awkward/explaining conversations Sunshine also deals with. We miss walking together. We miss the straightforwardness of our journey before the van. And Blue sometimes wonders what the point is of doing this if he doesn't get to be with Sunshine and other hikers. We are trying to make the most of this, but it isn't as carefree as it looks. Mentally, this is so much harder. And I don't know how to share pictures of mental struggles so here are some pretty flowers.

Had a nonstop rain from 1am till 11am, got a little break around 9:30am, just long enough to break down the sopping wet tent. Kept an eye on the radar most of the morning, just itching to get back on trail. Finally about 11am it looked like the rain had cleared out, took the shuttle to the trail head and was once again on my way. I think I‚Äôm going to call today ‚Äúremember where you started‚Äù, it literally felt like i was back in Georgia with all this climbing. Started out at 951ft of elevation and by the end of the day had hit 4227ft, but with all the ascents and descents getting to that point could probably double the total ascent climbed for today. I started getting a tight muscle on my left shin about halfway through the day, would have to stop and massage it every once and a while to help it, feels like it wants to lock up, but by the end of the day it was better, still there, but better. Made it to the top of Apple Orchard Mtn finally and went through the guillotine (pictured), looked like a fallen rock wedged between two huge boulders, kinda creepy. Not too many people on trail today, guess allot waited out the rain. Seen about 6 people slack packing southbound and inly ran into one other northbound, made for a lonely day. The wind gusts were pretty high today, blowing the water off the trees and blowing the big trees around, making for allot of creaking and moaning, I‚Äôd swear I‚Äôd hear people talking but knew I hadn‚Äôt seen anyone in an hour, the trees are talking to me, ü§£üòÇ. Found a nice tent site and quickly set up the tent. Got 14 miles in which isn‚Äôt bad considering i started at 11ish and climbed up hill all day. Foods in the belly, waters in hand, going to dream of lasagna and a cold beer.

Had coffee and breakfast and waited for it to clear out, finally did by about 10am. Most of the trail was pretty slick, most of the tread on my shoes has been worn away, i guess walking 700 miles will do that, lol. Most of the views were whited out, but it was a pretty calm day on trail. Got into Middle Creek Campground around 4:30pm and threw the wet clothes in the dryer. Still have 4 more days of this wet crap, so nothings going to dry easily, or at all. Have a pretty nice scenic section coming up tomorrow so hopefully it isn‚Äôt all whited out, but probably will be. Have a good night everyone.

The hotspot on my left foot is pretty much gone, been putting tape on it every morning to prevent any further agitation which seemed to work. Made a few road crossings and a rail crossing before heading up to the Blue Ridge Parkway. The trail has been cruising right along with it all day, making some great trail and views. Noticed that this section of the AT is pretty well maintained, all the over growth has been cut recently. Had a few sections that were out of the tree canopy and what a difference the temp was, it was hot, i checked the weather and it said it felt like 92, summer here we come. Got into Bobblets Gap Shelter about 6:30pm, filled up on water and headed out to look for a campsite, the sites at the shelter weren‚Äôt that great. Hiked up about 0.5 miles and found a sweet site up on the ridge, I‚Äôm pretty close to the BRP road, can hear it pretty good. The weather app is showing rain for the next 4-5 days starting tonight, luckily i fixed all my leaks, üòâ.

I met a man there who really left an impression on me. He treated his girlfriend with such chivalry and care, and I had never actually seen that kind of demeanor in a guy my age before. And now, that man comes home to me and this van every night- my husband. This van saw me through many roadtrips. Saw acquaintences turn into sisterhoods. My first ever genuine prayers happened in this van. Today I've been thinking about how things have a tendency to come full circle, and how our lives end up being so much more than we ever could have expected or predicted. I'm so glad I drove the magic bus to Louisville eleven years ago with a chick I barely knew. I'm so glad my dad drove the van to Blue and I on this hike so our adventure didn't have to end entirely. I'm so glad I set a trend early on in my life of "stepping out on limbs" and "putting myself out there"... Because so many adventures, lessons, and relationships came from it. And I'm so grateful to be here now, immersed in the best community in the world, experiencing amazing new things every day, with the greatest man in the world next to me<br>. .<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #appalachianthruhike #atclassof2019 #atnobo #atnobo2019 #thruhike #optoutside #hikerhunger #hikertrash #appalachiantrail2019 #hikerfeed

The weather got pretty chilly, lower 50‚Äôs I believe, made for a great nights sleep. Finally got up and packed about 8:30am and got back on trail. The next 10 mikes has got to be the best section of trail I‚Äôve been on so far, just view after epic view, with the trail running right along the cliff line. Saw allot of deer that really didn‚Äôt care i was there. Was walking down a section of trail that was pretty thick with head level brush, headed down hill and making a slight right, i got right up on this deer, maybe 10 feet when it decided to take off, scared the fricken crap out of me, i just yelled ‚Äúcome on dude! Geesh‚Äù üòÇ. Since this part of the trail is highly trafficked with day hikers, it was well worn and easy to keep a good pace. Got into Daleville around 3:30pm, not bad for walking 15 miles, i was crushing it. Took a shower, got laundry done and ordered a dinner box from pizza hut that I‚Äôm also gunna crush. Today was a good day and hope every one of you have a good night and tomorrow.

Got a little later start this morning which was needed after the 23 mile day yesterday. Legs and feet were pretty tight and didn‚Äôt want to move, but after walking around and some Kung Fu Fighting they were ready to go. Had a nice little climb up Cove Mtn and to the Dragons Tooth which was a huge stone monolith. For these first 7 miles it was rock climbing, climbing up sheer granite with a few metal ladders hammered right into the rock, some of it was pretty sketch, but fun. Got into Catawba Grocery store around 1ish and ate all the carbs my stomach would allow, and a few diet cokes. Sat there and charged some batteries while i ate. After that i headed back on trail and was treated to a great section of trail with view and view, the Virginia countryside has been epic. This section of trail is also very popular with allot of day hikers out, even on a Monday. Started the 1200ft climb up to McAfee Knob about 4:30pm, felt like i was running into people about every minute or so, i could smell their perfume or cologne from a mile away and they could probably say the same for me but just straight up stank ü§£. Got up to McAfee Knob about 6:30pm and was the only one up there besides a thru hiking couple from Europe. McAfee Knob is the most photographed section of the entire AT, and know i see why, the view here was humbling. I‚Äôve seen many pictures and video of this overlook but man, they just do not do it justice, this place has to be experienced first hand. I st up there for a half hour and continued on to Pig Farm Campsite just before Cambell Shelter, no it‚Äôs not on a pig farm, lol. Temps are supposed to fall into the upper 40s tonight, thats some gooood sleeping weather. Have a good night all.

It was nice starting the day out with a downhill for a change. Past through some nice virginia farmland, the rolling hills out here are beautiful. Past by the Keffer Oak tree, over 18ft around and over 300 years old, the Dover Oak tree along the AT in NY is slightly bigger. Didn‚Äôt have much for elevation gain again today, but these rocks and boulders are the plague of my existence. Most of the day was walking on huge slates of rock and almost a 45 degree angle hoping not to slip and fall on my butt. Got into Craig Creek Rd about 2:30pm after about 14 miles and was greeted with some trail magic, i walked up on the guy and he yells ‚Äúnow there‚Äôs a guy in need of a double cheeseburger!‚Äù, so i sat and ate a double cheeseburger and a sprite, oooh wee was that good, and just in time for the last climb of the day. About a 1500ft climb up to the Audie Murphy Monument, he was the most decorated American soldier of WWII, even had an American Flag pole up there. Made my way back down the backside of Brush Mtn, the feet and legs were about done by this time but not as bad as I‚Äôd thought they‚Äôd be when i planned on doing this many miles. Got into Pickle Branch Shelter about 7:30pm, well set my tent up just before it anyway. I got about 7 miles to Catawba Grocery in the morning, was running out of food hence the high miles today.

Made a double batch of my special blend coffee and some pop tarts. Once that initial shock of putting cold wet clothes on is over, and your body temp warms them up it does suck a little less üòÇ. Got back on trail around 8:30am and finished the climb I‚Äôd started yesterday before the rain. Pretty easy miles today in terms of elevation but the dang ole rocks and boulders had my pace down to a screeching halt. Nothing had time to dry from last night and had the rocks uber slippery, plus the tread on my shoes is dang near gone, mix that with wet rocks and it made for an adventure. About 10am the sun finally came out and started drying everything out. Passed by the road to Mountain Lake Resort, or more commonly known as ‚Äúthe Dirty Dancing Resort‚Äù where the original film was shot. I really wanted to go check it out but it was 5 miles down the road and didn‚Äôt have a ride üò©. Stopped into War Spur Shelter for lunch and laid some gear out to dry, didn‚Äôt really do much since it has been so humid. Started the first real climb of the day going up to Kelly Knob, about a 2000ft climb. Started to get a hot spot on the side of my left foot from walking in the wet socks all day, stopped and put some tape over it just to get me 4 more miles to the next shelter. Stopped at Kelly Knob Overlook, but was overgrown and not much of a view. Got into Laurel Creek Shelter around 4:30pm and layer most my gear out in the sun, hopefully get these socks dry. This is a pretty nice shelter, has water, a privy and decent tent pads. Fingers crossed it doesn‚Äôt rain again tonight ü§û.

I hiked about 32 miles with Blue after my two-week rest in the magic bus. The first day back was rough. Foot pain came right back early on with a vengeance. But I smiled through it, thinking maybe I could hide it from Blue and just keep going. Smart, right? Well 11 miles in, my body must have realized my mind wasn't taking the hint, and it spoke louder. My left knee locked up and suddenly maintaining a normal stride was very painful. We pushed 5 more to the next shelter through heavy rain. I hobbled with Blue wet, chaffed, in tons of pain, and even developed my first ever blister since starting the AT. Welcome back, Sunshine. "Tomorrow will be a new day," I thought. Except that night, my sleeping pad leaked (AGAIN!) and I didn't get much rest. As optimistic as I try to be, I woke up feeling beat down and heavy that next morning. We talked about the what-ifs, if my injuries should end my hike for good. Not much later, my knee pain got so much worse. Blue told me what I needed to hear- that it's time to get my body off the trail. I tearfully accepted that he was right. We called a trail angel who would pick us up at the next road, 2.1 miles from where we stood. The slowest, most painful, saddest saunter of my life. I know- so far, all I've shared here is bitter. So here is the sweet part: we aren't going home just yet! We are back in the magic bus, Blue will continue on, and I'll be there supporting him every step of the way. We are a team, and we will continue doing this together the best we can. We didn't expect our hike to look this way, but there are some things you just can't control. And we aren't ready to say goodbye to this journey or these people just yet. (Ps- this post is to update you on our journey... We are not looking for medical advice about knee pain or plantar fasciitis‚ô•Ô∏è)

Had a good nights rest at Woods Hole Hostel but was up and on trail in no time. Neville, the caretaker of the fine establishment made no bake chocolate oatmeal bars that were amazing, i had two for breakfast before i left, they had to weigh at least a pound each. Had about a 12 mile hike into Pearisburg, VA and got into town around 1:30pm. Had a few good views of the country side, views have been rare around here and usually have to take a blue blaze to go see them, usually worth it. Once in town, made a stop at DQ for a flamethrower burger and fries, so unhealthy but oh so good. Ran over to the Post Office and sent a few of my cold weather gear home that was taking up space and adding unneeded weight. Pack is a little lighter but not quite where I‚Äôd like it to be. Walked around Pearisburg for a bit to checkout the town but really wasn‚Äôt much to see. Headed back the DQ, this time for a Turtle Pecan Blizzard, could have eaten 5 of those but didn‚Äôt want to get fat, lol. I got a hitch back to the trail but the guy dropped me off at the wrong trailhead. There were 2 about 0.6 miles apart and he dropped me off at the further one. So being the AT Purest (someone who walks ever inch of the trail) i am, i walked back to where i had left off then turned around and walked back in the right direction. Just like with any town, the trail went up about 2000ft to the ridge line. Setup camp at Rice Field Shelter and realized this shelter doesn‚Äôt have water source, bruh! So i made the 0.6 mile trek back down the trail to the last piped spring and CLIMBED back up. The meals i eat for dinner are dehydrated so water is a must have, otherwise i would have just waited till morning. Actually have service tonight for once, gunna Netflix and chill.

Headed up to Trents Grocery and had a little breakfast, just some sausage biscuits and a Bang energy drink, breakfast of champions. Finally got back on the good ole white blazes about 9:30am and made our way up to Dismal Falls, would have been a great place to set up camp. Walked by some really thick rhododendron forests, it was so thick that it was almost like walking in the dark it just blocked out so much of the sun, pretty cool. Made it to Wapiti Shelter about 1:30pm and had lunch. We had a female deer come visit us while we were finishing up, must of been used to people cause she didn‚Äôt care we were there at all. After lunch we headed up for our first climb of the day, about 1500ft for the next 3 miles, have I mentioned how hot it is. Once we were at the top we were greeted with a great view of the Virginia countryside. Views have been rare since entering Virginia, usually blocked by trees. Hiked along the ridge line for a few miles after the view and heard thunder off in the distance, checked the radar and had a huge band of storms heading our way. About an hour later i hit Big Horse Gap and seen the sky getting darker and the thunder getting closer. The original plan was to make it to Docs Knob Shelter and pitch the tent, which was 4 miles up trail or 1.5 miles up trail and 0.5 miles off trail is Woods Hole Hostel. I wasn‚Äôt gunna make it to the shelter so i set my sights on the hostel. From Big Horse Gap to Sugar Run Gap (about 1.5 miles) i ran that entire stretch, hoping over logs, through rock gardens, up muddy hills all with a 30lb pack on, i was getting it. I kept yelling ‚Äúwhere‚Äôs the damn road?‚Äù ‚ÄúCome on road‚Äù. I got about 400 meters from the road and the sky just let loose, thunder, lightning and high winds. I threw my pack down, put on the rain cover and put on my rain coat which was pretty much useless since i was already soaked. Picked up the pack and made it to Woods Hole Hostel in no time. This place i amazing, nice showers, nice beds and all organic dinner, made fresh here on the farm, i think i made a good‚¨á

Lehigh Gap, or the Palmerton Zinc Superfund site as the trail signs call it.<br><br>This was my first full-on bouldering climb up 1,000 feet of rock, totally exposed. Ten years ago there were no trees on this mountain, just cesspools of heavy metals and rocks. The superfund rehab project is in the process of trying to revegetate the area, but compounds like lead, arsenic and zinc are still found in the streams. So it was not only an enormous exposed climb, it was an enormous exposed climb followed b almost 15 miles of undrinkable water sources. I did the climb with 3 liters of water, or just over 12 extra pounds in my already 20-pound pack.<br><br>It was so. Much. Fun.<br><br>I passed a family where the little boy kept saying how easy the climb was. I said ‚Äúif it‚Äôs so easy, you wanna carry my backpack?‚Äù ü§™ We high-fived when I passed him on the rock scramble.<br><br>I‚Äôve been expecting Pennsylvania to be horribly rocky and slow. With those expectations, Pennsylvania delivered‚Äîfor the most part. It was pretty dang rocky, but usually without the ‚Äòhorrible‚Äô. People kept saying it would get worse. It just stayed bad, it never got horrible. And I guess when you have the expectation that something is going to suck, and then it sucks a little bit less, the whole thing becomes a game. Like I got lucky. At the end of the state, well...Pennsylvania was really...kinda fun!

Had a bleak bear wondering thru the shelter about 2:30am, could hear him/her trampling around and breathing around the shelter which no one was in but a few hikers thought hanging their food bags in there would be cool, but as soon as him/her heard the zipper on the tent it took off. Got back on trail around 8am and was ready for a short day, feet, ankles and buttocks were ready for a break. Hiked about 6 miles to Trents Grocery were i had a resupply package from my amazing grandma & grandpa waiting for me. Have mentioned how HOT it‚Äôs been the past week? If not, it‚Äôs been crazy hot, just walking at an easy pace has me sweating bullets. Got into Trents about 11:30am and finally got to take a shower, do laundry and dry everything out, not bad for 6 bucks. Were camped right next to a stable with a horse named Thomas and he loooooves apples. He‚Äôs a little older and can barely see but he‚Äôs a gooood boy.

It was hot/muggy, and when it‚Äôs hot/muggy I walk slowwwww. Five miles in I felt lonely. It was a persistent loneliness, the kind I sometimes get in the woods. It gets worse when I see another human and we don‚Äôt connect very well. Then I feel more alone.<br><br>So I decided I would be very intentional about trying to connect with humans today.<br><br>First, a past hiker and his three friends brought trail magic to trail‚Äîcandy and Yuengling. I didn‚Äôt just take the Magic. We sat on trail for 20 minutes having a beer and chatting. Taking the time.<br><br>Then the folks at the shelter. I stopped for two hours to hang out and hear flip-floppers stories of how their hike was going so far. I knew I wouldn‚Äôt sleep there, but I stopped to talk anyway.<br><br>Then Grits and Half Note, two more flip floppers I met and hiked with for two hours.<br><br>At the end of the day, I‚Äôm camping on my own and I‚Äôll never see these people again (I‚Äôm getting off trail again, this time for a month, so they‚Äôll be way ahead). And yet, just being on the same wavelength as a few other humans for a few moments made me feel not so alone in the world.<br><br>My 80th day on trail was complete with me having 2-person conversations with just myself. And they were enlightening, even if that sounds bats.<br><br>After 80 days, this trail and I are starting to jive.

I thought I would walk here. But I drove. I tearfully asked a trail angel on the phone before my drive if the ATC would still take my picture.  He responded emphatically, after saying "YES" a dozen times: "you should be proud of what you've done. You were injured and had to rest, but you are hiking this trail. Get your picture taken!" I said okay, dried my tears and started my drive. When I got there I walked around and visited with other hikers while I waited for Blue. I talked with "dot com," a volunteer there at the ATC, who was so encouraging about our journey. She said, "when other people finish the AT, they are done and don't know what to do. You can still have a little part of it left waiting for you." She reminded me that doing trail magic during this time is a great way to experience the trail without walking on it. Then I saw these posters of other hikers whose journeys were unexpected and unconventional... And I felt encouraged. Blue finally arrived, and we took our halfway picture together. The last 12 days have been so mentally difficult. I didn't walk past the 1000th mile or the West Virginia sign. And no, I didn't walk into Harper's Ferry. But we journeyed here together. And now, we will walk out together.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #appalachianthruhike #atclassof2019 #atnobo #atnobo2019 #thruhike #optoutside #hikerhunger #hikertrash #appalachiantrail2019 #hikerfeed #harpersferry

I could hear the thunder off in the distance, but kept telling myself it wasn‚Äôt coming this way, but it finally did, had to jump up and grab my somewhat dry clothes off the line, saved it. Got a late start this morning, did get up out of the tent until 8ish and then still didn‚Äôt get packed up until 9ish, bunch of bums man ü§£. Had some trail magic a few feet from where we camped, cooked us pancakes, bacon, sausage, eggs, biscuits and strawberries, good way to start the day. Had a nice steep 500ft climb to start the day, a full belly didn‚Äôt help ü§Æ. But after the climb we were on a ridge line so we busted out 6 miles in no time. We got to Brushy Mountain Outpost about 2pm and got some lunch, couldn‚Äôt have planned that better if we tried. Ordered a cheeseburger and cajun fries to help fuel the body. We hung out there for about an hour with a few other thru hikers then decided to git the trail. We crossed over US Hwy 52 down to Kimberling Creek and started another 500ft steep climb back up to the ridge line. These ridge lines are nice when you get up them but the lack of water sources suck, we went about 8 miles with not one water source üò©. Passed the 600 mile marker about 4 miles before the shelter, 600 miles knocked down, 1,590 to go üò≥. Currently at Jenny Knob Shelter which had the closest water source. Luckily it has a privy, probably going to visit that in the morning üòß. Have a great night everyone and don‚Äôt forget you gotta work in the morning üò¨ü§£.

To all my fellow CrossFit and FitBox peeps back in good ole Columbus, MS. I hope you have an awesome time completing MURPH, wish i was there working out with you all, i miss ya and will be back soon to put ya through some grueling workouts üòé.<br>Saw another black bear on trail this morning, walked up on another thru hiker just ahead of me and said he walked up on him and didn‚Äôt even know he was there, the hiker spotted him first, said he had to bang his trekking poles to get his attention, but as soon as he did the bear took off üò≥. The trail was kind of uneventful today, not much going on, just pounding the miles down. Met a few new thru hikers at Jenkins Shelter, met one girl that started the AT in February but took a few weeks off for work and is heading up to maine for the long haul. Had a nice little climb just after lunch, then followed an old service road that was nice and flat, made for a nice easy day which was nice cause it was HOT. The green tunnel is a life saver when the sun is at maximum power, spent a few miles hiking in the sun and what a game changer it is when you finally get back in the shade, felt like a 15-20 degree difference. Set up camp next to Laurel Creek and went for a little swim in the deep spot, let the feet soak for a bit and washed all the sweat off, it felt gooood üòã. We have some trail magic coming in the AM for breakfast, not sure what time but i think I‚Äôll wait for it ü§£. Hope everyone had a great Memorial Day weekend üá∫üá∏.

We decided to stay at a campsite just before our next big climb, about a 2 mile climb with almost 1000ft of elevation, it wasn‚Äôt bad. The weather has been crazy hot the past few days, hotter than expected for this time of year. Headed downhill for awhile into some nice Virginia country side, into a few cow pastures that the AT goes thru. Had a few gates to go through but some of the fences just had ladders you had to climb over, felt like i was back doing Spartan races again, except with a 30lb pack ü§£. Had another steep climb up Brushy Mtn and stopped for a snack at Knot Maul Branch Shelter. We headed down to the water source behind it, about 100 yards downhill of course. On our way down we seen a little black bear rummaging through the rhododendrons, it was a small one so we were weary of momma coming around but it took off and never came back. Headed down the backside of Brushy Mtn and prepared for the next climb. These climbs haven‚Äôt been long, but man are they steep, had about a 700ft climb in less than a mile, STEEEEP ü§Æ. After we got done with that bastard we had lunch, drank allot if water and headed down to prepare for the last climb of the day. We originally had planned to do this one tomorrow, but looking at what we had for tomorrow we decided just to get it over with. A 2100ft climb over the next 5 miles, the first 2 miles STEEP AF, then a gradual climb for the rest. At the time i really regretted making this call but afterwards i didn‚Äôt, was good to just knock it out. After the 2 miles steep grade we headed out into an open prairie, while still uphill, it was a gradual uphill and got some nice views. We got to Chestnut Knob Shelter around 5:30pm. A beautiful fully enclosed stone shelter on a nice prairie. Little windy tonight, but better than the humid stale air we had last night. Happy Saturday everyone.

You can likely already infer what happened, but I‚Äôll fill in the details as part of my grieving process.<br><br>My papa gave me an eagle feather necklace before I started the PCT in 2017. It has since come with me on every trail. I took it off in the tent to give my neck a rest (sometimes its long chain gets twisted up while I sleep) and put it in the pocket of the tent. I went to bed.<br><br>Waking up at 5:00am, I packed up all my crap, shook out my tent (FATAL MISTAKE üò≠üòµü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è), loaded my bag and hiked north.<br><br>18 miles later I felt my chest and the wave of oh-fuckery swept over me. Shame, hot-in-the-faceless, disappointment, tunnel vision. I stopped and went through everything‚Äîmaybe I actually put it in a bag? Maybe it didn‚Äôt fall out when I shook out the tent?‚Äîbut no dice.<br><br>This picture is of exactly where it is probably laying in the gravel that I camped on.‚Äù, waiting to be found. To end this without a total downer, the picture also shows my new friend Hot Toddy reading his AWOL book. Hot Toddy is an accountant from SoCal in ‚Äòreal life‚Äô but he really doesn‚Äôt want you to know the accountant part!<br><br>I know the necklace is just a thing, but it‚Äôs a symbol of love for my dad and it‚Äôs a way to bring him on all my adventures, so it‚Äôs taking me a minute to get to the acceptance stage in the grieving process. I‚Äôm still having fantasies of going back to look for it.

Whatever it was, it wasn‚Äôt there long, but i kept one eye open the rest of the night, every little leaf blowing or twig falling had me wide awake, needless to say I didn‚Äôt sleep that well. Woke up and did the normal camp routine and was on trail by 7:30am. Started the day out with some nice downhill to The Settlers Museum, there was an old school house from the late 1800‚Äôs that had some trail magic, ice cold sodas and snacks, place was kinda creepy. The trail crossed Hwy 81 in Atkins, VA which had a few gas stations and a restaurant called The Barn. We had lunch there and sat and charged all the battery packs for a few hours, they had some really good food. We headed out and got back on trail around 2pm and braced for the climbs ahead. We hit mile marker 457 which is the 1/4 way mark for NOBOs, that is a HUGE milestone for me, sat there for a moment to let it all sink in and reflect on the past 547 mile walk, it feels good...real good. After that we had some VERY steep climbs, the guide book did not do any of them justice. We had about 6 little bumps, no more than 4-5 hundred feet but man did they kick my butt. It has been really hot the past few days and with the hills i was pretty much drenched. After the last climb of the day we had a little downhill (ü•≥) into camp. For taking a 3 hour lunch and getting 14 miles in, i think we did pretty good. Hopefully sleep better tonight and not wake up every 20 minutes.

She's not out of the woods yet, so please keep sending your prayers and good joojoo. Trail magic continues to flow from Sunshine and the Magic Bus. Hitches, beers, snacks, slackpacking- enjoying every second of it. It's been an amazing way to stay plugged into the AT community and flood an otherwise crappy situation with joy and positivity. We are still truckin' with hearts full of gratitude for everyone who has supported us. Thank you to Rhythm and Twenty for the pack shakedown... We believe Sunshine's feet will thank you for lessening the impact of every step! Thank you Jimmy and I Believe for calling every day, helping us read maps to determine rendezvous points and safe places to park, and for being excited about our journey. Thank you Screw-loose and Tough Mother for driving so many hours together to bring us this van and surprise us. And thank you Screw-loose for funding this trail magic... You've made many hikers smile. Thank you to all the people we haven't seen physically, but who routinely comment to celebrate our journey and encourage us. Halo, Q, Papa Bear, Teach, Peach, Gopher- y'all better know we daydream of hiking with you again and send you big love every single day! And to all the hikers we know and love behind and ahead of us- y'all are kicking ass and we are so excited for your journey. Just wanted to put our love out there.

It‚Äôs always hard picking that pack up after a resupply, thing weighs a ton, i keep wanting to eat everything just to keep the weight down, lol. Had some good flat terrain to walk on today, virginia has been very kind when it comes to pointless up and downs, but the rocks on this section are no joke. We made our last climb of the day about a mile before camp, it was STEEP but short, with all the rocks in trail there‚Äôs no ground for the trekking poles to grab hold of, so you‚Äôre jamming them into the crevice of a rock hoping it sticks, just means we gotta use the trusty legs more, lol. We made it to Partnership Shelter (533.5) about 3:30pm, which was right before Pat Jennings Visitor Center, you could order pizza, take a shower, soda machine, this was the Audi of shelters, if it wasn‚Äôt so early we‚Äôd probably stayed, üòé. Got into camp about 5pm, we spent some time finding one with some cell service, been about 5-6 days since we‚Äôve had any signal at night, we found one right before our next big climb in the AM.

I had a resupply package sent to Sufi Lodge in troutdale, VA with the intention to stay the night. Since we pulled off that 20+ mile hike yesterday we got ahead if schedule. The package didn‚Äôt end up showing until 2pm and there was a hiker picnic in troutdale at 6pm. We debated on whether to stay for the picnic or head out and get some miles in, with all the hikers heading to the picnic we decided to stay. It was a good time, there was so much food and some killer desserts. I think they said their were about 60 hikers, which was down some from last year. We stocked up on food for this resupply, gunna shoot for 90 miles before we head into the next town. If we can average atleast 15 miles a day we can knock it down in 6 days, an 18 mile average 5 days.

Hit the 500 mile marker shortly after GHSP, only 1,690 miles to go. Most of the day was spent on some beautiful balds which wound around a few state parks, allot of day hikers. Got some trail magic coming into Fox Creek, had a couple hot dogs and a coke, three days in a row for trail magic. üòä It seems like they strategically place themselves right before the huge climbs, it wasn‚Äôt too bad but a full stomach didn‚Äôt help. Got into camp about 6:30pm for a total of 21.3 miles, those last 3 miles were painful, I didn‚Äôt plan on doing that much but that section of trail had absolutely no campsites.

Out-given. I've received trail magic and I've given it, but it doesn't matter. Yesterday I handed a hiker a bag of popcorn because it was her favorite snack and she had just eaten her last bag. We talked for a bit and she asked enough questions that I ended up telling her about my plantar fasciitis and why we have the van. She asked my name and I told her "I'm Sunshine." Her reaction was so squeal, pull me in for a hug, kiss my sweaty cheek, and say "you ARE Sunshine!" Before our interaction was over she held hands with me as she prayed for my feet and gave me a $20 bill so I could do more magic for other hikers. After she left I sat in the van and asked myself, "what the heck just happened? Who gave magic to who?" The cool thing I'm learning as a hiker pretending to be a trail angel for a bit, is how to receive. As a person giving, I love it when the hikers stick around for a bit and tell me how their day is going and other stories from their hike so far. I want them to take one of everything and say "yes" to every favor I offer. So, when my feet allow me to walk the trail again, that is how I will receive trail magic: eagerly, abundantly, and in no hurry. I will not be sheepish and thank them too many times because I feel that I am inconveniencing them, because I'll know that I am not. I now know how it is just as much a joy to give as it is to get. My best way to say "thank you" is just to receive joyfully... Especially since I can't afford a $20 bag of popcorn.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #appalachianthruhike #atclassof2019 #atnobo #atnobo2019 #thruhike #optoutside #hikerhunger #hikertrash #appalachiantrail2019 #hikerfeed #trailangel #trailmagic

We think her trail name should be "tough mother," because she is down to earth and loves her kids fiercely, sweetly, and  sacrificially. She would do anything for her kids, her kids' spouses, and even her kids' friends if they needed her. TM has seen first-hand how magical the AT community can be, and she fell in love with it just as much as we did. She even established  long-distance friendships with some of our tramily, their spouses, and trail angels we know out here. One of our favorite moments of our hike so far was coming down on the switchbacks into Erwin and seeing her silhouette through the trees, leaned up against the guardrail waiting for us. We had no idea she was coming and we tearfully ran down with our full packs to get one or three of her famous hugs. TM is sassy, independent, observant of others, and willing to try just about anything once. We feel supported by her every day because we know she believes in us. And it shouldn't go left unsaid that Sunshine feels she helped raise two of the best men on the planet, who she is lucky to call "husband" and "brother."<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #appalachianthruhike #atclassof2019 #atnobo #atnobo2019 #thruhike #optoutside #hikerhunger #hikertrash #appalachiantrail2019 #hikerfeed

We think his trail name should be "screw-loose." When you mix determination, a giving heart, and out-of-the-box thinking, you get something like him. He's the kinda guy who drives 8+ hours from Indianapolis to BFE Virginia to let his daughter and son-in-love use his van. And better yet, it was his idea. He wouldn't hike the AT in a million years. In fact, he says there isn't anything in the world he would want to do everyday, all day, for 6 months straight. He has a point. But even though he doesn't want to be in our stinky muddy shoes, he shows genuine interest and support toward what we are doing. Screw-loose loves a good story, and he enjoys helping others write theirs. The elements of a good story are hardship, victory, and compelling characters. Screw-loose is a compelling character who will rally alongside you in your hardship until you have your victory moment. He is goofy, heavily caffeinated, a talker, a thinker, a doer, and a man who could care less about the "normal" way to do things. Perhaps that's why his daughter was crazy enough to think that walking 2,192 miles was a good idea. Yeah, we will go ahead and blame that one on him. .<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #appalachianthruhike #atclassof2019 #atnobo #atnobo2019 #thruhike #optoutside #hikerhunger #hikertrash #appalachiantrail2019 #hikerfeed

But it wouldn't be like us if we didn't share the unlovely parts too. Like how strange it felt to drive again for the first time in 3 months. And to not be together 24/7. Especially the first day Blue hiked without me, it felt very foreign for both of us. I shed a few tears as I watched him walk away on the AT alone. He felt lonely without me there, especially since our entire tramily has dispersed between trail days, getting off trail, or being behind or ahead of us. I worried about him a lot and checked his GPS often. Struggled with all the downtime and seeing so many cars and roads and signs instead of trees and birds and streams. I also still have the hunger of a hiker, but not the activity level of one. So I've spent a lot of time being hungry, with very little to do, and with many yummy hiker foods within arms reach. Torture! I've had a lot of time to think "what if my feet don't heal" and worrying about losing my trail legs entirely. And there's been a slight identity crisis... Feeling like I can't really call myself a thru-hiker right now, and not feeling like I belong in hostels or campgrounds because I didn't walk there. It has occurred to me that this is only a fraction of what we will both feel when we return home. Back to the daily grind, feeling relatively sedentary, not being able to satisfy our appetites for mountains and honey buns, not spending every night in the woods, and encountering people all the time who won't know us as hikers or match our interest in the AT. (Sidenote- if you have a friend at home who's spent time on the AT or any other long trail, show them some love by asking about their experiences. Maybe call them by their trail name every now and then. It will mean more than you know.) Anyway- None of these things have overpowered the "good" that we see in this situation.

We are having a total blast. It was a hard decision for us to make to get the van and rest Sunshine's feet for an extended period of time. But it was clearly our best option. Once the decision was made, we jumped into it wholeheartedly and put our efforts into enjoying this phase of our hike as much as possible. That means driving to sunset vistas because we can, tons of trail magic, slackpacking bigger miles than ever, comfy car sleeps, and eating food we usually wouldn't because they are too heavy to carry. Bluegrass realized that the mentality behind his hikes needs to adapt when he slackpacks alone. Since his solo slackpacking can't be about quality time with Sunshine, he decided to change his focus to turning it into a fun challenge. He's been having a great time seeing how fast and far he can go, and looking forward to seeing Sunshine and the Magic Bus in mountain gaps and parking lots along the way. At the end of the day, he is feeling good mentally and emotionally and feeling pretty proud of what he accomplished. Sunshine has had fun leaving notes/signs for him along the trail and reading maps to determine where she will see him next. Even though we aren't hiking together, we saw our first bear together from the van while driving to the trail head! We were pumped about that. We adjusted to vanlife pretty quickly and have a system that works really well already. We are so pumped we get to experience thru-hiking, vandwelling, and trail angel-ing all in one adventure!<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #appalachianthruhike #atclassof2019 #atnobo #atnobo2019 #thruhike #optoutside #hikerhunger #hikertrash #appalachiantrail2019 #hikerfeed

I jumped right up to run out and grab em but it was too late, they were soaked when i woke up, oh well. Got back on trail about 8am and headed up the Virginia Creeper/AT for about a mile, then the AT split from the Creeper. We missed the sign where the two split and ended up going 0.6 miles up the Creeper before we realized we hadn‚Äôt seen a whiteblaze in a while. Made it to a cow pasture about 11:30am and seen a bunch if baby cows, seven started talking to them but they paid no attention. We got some more trail magic just before our big climb of the day. We walked up and he handed us some ice cream sandwiches and a can of pop. We found out he was a retired Army Ranger and has been going up and down the AT helping hikers out, he was a cool dude. After that we had a 2000ft climb up to Whitetop Mtn, it wouldn‚Äôt have been so bad but the rocks and boulders on the trail really slowed us down, took about 1.5 hours to get up, but it was worth it. We had a beautiful 360 degree view of our surroundings, had lunch and laid our gear out to dry. Eventually made our way down to Elk Garden which was a beautiful open prairie, we were going set up camp there but it was to early. Had an 1100ft climb up Mt Rogers to get to Thomas Knob Shelter. The whole way up again was nothing but rocks, ideal foot placement was a must, one miss step and you could easily roll an ankle. Finally made it to camp about 5:30pm, set up camp, made dinner and laid my tired butt down. Hitting that ole 500 mile marker in the morning and heading through the Grayson Highlands State Park with all the ponies. Have a good night everyone.

What a blast trail days was, with all the music, food and beer, it turned out to be a great weekend. I got to meet so many people that i have been following on Instagram for years and meet a lot of new inspirational people to follow. Sorry I hadn‚Äôt posted in a few days, service in Damascus was non existent.<br>Seven and I headed out around 9:30am after breakfast and getting some charge on my phone. Wally had been planning on heading home after Damascus so we had to say our goodbyes, you are a good dude and you will be missed. Just like ALL the towns we leave, there was a good climb out of town, just enough to get the legs going. We spent a good chunk of trail right along White Top Laurel Creek with nice campsites, we were tempted to set up camp and go for a swim but it was only 1am and had to get some miles in. Got some sweet trail magic coming out of US 58, two 2016 thru hikers set up a grill and made some bomb hamburgers, it was just before the biggest climb of the day, it was a trap.ü§£ made the 1000ft climb up to Saunders Shelter and took a break, it was hot and humid all day, the sweat was just dripping off my arms like a faucet. Made our way back to Laurel Creek where the Virginia Creeper Trail and the AT come together for a few miles. Set up camp right along the creek and cleaned ourselves up a bit, was nice to get that sweat off before dinner. We got about a 2000ft climb first thing in the morning up White Top Mt, be nice to get that knocked out before it gets hot.

We are SO ready to celebrate our achievement by diving into half gallons of ice cream. <br>We wake up early to hike the 13 miles into Pine Grove Furnace State Park for the half gallon challenge (where hikers try to eat a half gallon of ice cream in one sitting). Lightfoot and Early Bird are the first two on the scene, and then I walk up to see them sitting at a picnic table outside the general store. It‚Äôs not. Fucking. Open. Not at all today. We sit there for an hour trying to decide what to do. Hitch into town for some ice cream? Hike 8 miles to the next store? Call a shuttle?<br><br>I only have a few hours until I‚Äôll be on my way to the airport, so a decision needs to be made. I‚Äôm feeling anxious with all the options, and decide that we should at least attempt to hitch. I figure I can start trying to hitch and the others can either get in the car with me or follow soon after. Then, as I‚Äôm standing with my thumb out, an idea strikes me. I could hitch nearer to the airport so my shuttle (a few hours later) won‚Äôt have to pick me up in this remote state park. That means a cheaper shuttle. The second car that drives by is going right into Boiling Springs,  exactly where I need to go! My trail family won‚Äôt be following me that far, so I say a quick goodbye and hop into the bright yellow Jeep.<br><br>The moment I get into town and get all my stuff out of the car, Lightfoot calls me and tells me the General Store did open after all. He leads the phone call with ‚ÄúSo...can you get a ride back? They just opened.‚Äù ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I‚Äôm bummed that I don‚Äôt get to join Oats, Ewok, and Lightfoot for their half gallon challenge, but I‚Äôm ready to go home and get a short rest from trail life.

I have never left trail on a thru hike before, but I‚Äôve had this on my radar since before I started the AT. I‚Äôll be taking an intensive course/training in Strategies for Trauma Awareness and Resilience in Minneapolis. Part of the reality of leaving trail for so long is that, when I return, I‚Äôll be hiking with a completely new group of people. The folks I‚Äôve gotten to know for the past three months will be at least a couple hundred miles ahead. So I soak up every last minute I have with them, and remember what Bob Peoples tells us‚Äîthe only difference between the friends you‚Äôre hiking with now and everyone else on trail is that you just haven‚Äôt met the ‚Äòeveryone else‚Äô yet.<br><br>We end the day by cowboy camping, and it‚Äôs a regular ol‚Äô sleepover party!

We knew it would suck. We knew it would be amazing. But behind those two broad understatements are so many nuances, details, and lessons that we can't yet begin to put into words.  Ultimately the most important thing we have learned so far is how we want the story of our thru-hike to read when it's all said and done. When we started, we would have told you that we hope we stay on pace, make it to Katahdin with no injuries, and go home having achieved something great. And I guess that would have been fine and good. But now we know differently. We want our thru-hike to be a story of togetherness and determination. It isn't just "Sunshine" or "Bluegrass." It's "Sunshine AND Bluegrass," and that is what is special about us. Realizing this empowered us to approach our hike a bit more creatively. I'm ready to admit it- it's not just foot pain I am dealing with. I am injured and I need to get off trail. But not Bluegrass! Due to the great lengths our parents were willing to go to in order to support us, we now have a vehicle with us. I'm going to take a few weeks off trail and rest. During that time, I'm going to assist Blue with slackpacking so he can hopefully make up for the time we've lost dealing with my injury. This wasn't an easy decision. I desperately want to keep my feet on that lovely and merciless trail, and Blue isn't sure how/whether he will enjoy hiking without me. But we know this is our best shot. There WILL be trail magic. There WILL be healing. And hopefully I can rejoin Blue further north and we can finish this thing on foot together. The miles I miss will be there forever, and I have the rest of my life to make them up. No, this isn't the "purist's" way to thru-hike. But it is purely "us." And it's a hell of a lot better than quitting! Wish us luck...we love you all. -Sunshine

Most hikers out here are very polite. Some don't know any better. And the minority are just plain rude. Regardless, spreading some awareness is up to us, so here goes!<br>1. Hikers going uphill have right-of-way. Move over for them to pass so they don't lose their momentum, unless they say that they are eager for a reason to take a break.<br>2. Always move over for groups.<br>3. Don't take up more space than you need at shelters or picnic tables<br>4. If a hiker has caught up to you, that means their pace is faster than yours. Don't get competitive, just move over and wish them a good hike.<br>5. When the sun goes down, so should your noise level. The darker it is, the quieter you should be.<br>6. Use an earbud to listen to music instead of playing it for all to hear. We would like to choose when we listen to music and what we listen to... Don't make that choice for others.<br>7. Try to avoid setting up in a shelter after dark and/or when hikers are clearly sleeping. Obviously bad weather is an exception.<br>8. Don't move other people's gear.<br>9. If you leave a shelter before sunrise, please try to pack up as quietly as possible.<br><br>We don't mean to sound preachy! And most of this should be common sense. But lately we've been a bit surprised. This doesn't cover everything, but it seems like a good place to start.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #appalachianthruhike #atclassof2019 #atnobo #atnobo2019 #thruhike #optoutside #hikerhunger #hikertrash #appalachiantrail2019 #hikerfeed #trailettiquette #mindyourmanners #psa

The town opened up the ball fields for hikers to camp for the weekend, free showers, free laundry and free haircuts, i almost feel civilized! ü§£ The Damascus Fire Department had a free hiker feed for all hikers, deep fried chicken, potatoes, coleslaw and brownies, so good.

The conversation started with him asking me how I was liking the trail so far, and me, after a long pause trying to think of something positive to say, blurting out ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not‚Äù. Boy oh boy I don‚Äôt know how I kept my head from exploding when he went on to extoll all the reasons this trail was so much fun and then... we crossed the road, found Juju doing trail magic, and sat down together. Thus becoming friends. Maybe in real life, when I think I can‚Äôt stand someone, I should just sit down with them for 20 minutes and eat a hot dog. I also narrowly missed Oats at trail magic, AGAIN. I think we‚Äôre the only two millennial women thru-hikers within a few hundred miles, and have been just missing one another by a few minutes here or there. We‚Äôve been hearing a lot about each other, so I‚Äôm hoping we‚Äôll finally get to meet in Harper‚Äôs Ferry tomorrow.<br><br>Staying at Blackburn Trail Center tonight with Juju, Shiner, J3 and Ewok. These guys and gal are fantastic. I figured I‚Äôd be staying at this trail center cabin alone. Instead, I descended the mile of switchbacks and heard their friendly voices‚ÄîHOORAY!<br><br>In other news, I talked to Legs today. I should be reunited with him (and my sunglasses he‚Äôs been carrying for several hundred miles now) in Harper‚Äôs Ferry. He‚Äôll be alone, however. He told me that his entire trail family imploded. Within the last two days all three of the guys he was hiking with have simply lost the will to keep going towards Maine. They‚Äôre done with their thru-hike and getting off trail. Just like that. Less than a hundred miles from halfway. I guess it‚Äôs called the ‚ÄòVirginia Blues‚Äô. Yeesh.

This year is his third attempt at thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail. We were excited to be there as he crossed the Punchbowl Overlook- the furthest he'd ever walked on the AT in his previous attempts, until this year when he finally walked past it. Teach is kind, witty, resilient, competitive, and candid. Teach is many things. A joker, a woodworker, a kickboxer, a martial artist, an enthusiast, an ADD poster child, an adrenaline seeker, a hiker... But most importantly, he is an incredible father and teacher. He has a rare and wonderful ability to connect with, understand, affirm, and empower others. He gets to the heart of things and does them his way- not the conventional/textbook way. He took the role of "dad" on as his greatest honor and enjoyed every second of it. He speaks of his daughter in such a way that it is clear she is the light of his life. As an educator, he connected with the most troubled kids in personal and effective ways, and created a safe place in his classroom that many students flocked to.  A free spirit with the kind of wisdom that only comes from time and maybe a few mistakes. But don't call him mature or you might hurt his feelings. .<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #appalachianthruhike #atclassof2019 #atnobo #atnobo2019 #thruhike #optoutside #hikerhunger #hikertrash #appalachiantrail2019 #hikerfeed

It felt like about 1-2am it had gotten warmer. Went to bed all curled up in the sleeping bag then around 1-2am i woke up sweating, it was weird, but still had a good sleep. We stayed at the Rabbit Hole Hostel that night, woke up around 7:30am and Cat, the owner of the hostel had the coffee ready to go. This hostel was amazing, definitely in my top 3 hostel stays so far, and they only opened in February. Got back on trail about 9am and went through this beautiful meadow. Cows are free to roam here to help keep the overgrowth of grass down and got to take this mandatory AT thru hiker pic. This section of trail has been great, no major climbs, good verity of scenery and plenty of good logs to sit on. We had heard at the hostel last night that there would be some trail magic at the next gap from where we were, which was about 9 miles, if we got our butts in gear we could be there by 1pm. Once we got done with the photo op, we boot scootin boggied our way up the trail to get to that trail magic by 1pm. The weather was beautiful and the Trail forgiving, we had gotten there by 12:30am, just quick enough before he ran out of hot dogs. We sat and stuffed our face for a good half hour and mingled with the thru hiker folk. Allot of people have been slack packing the past few days. Not sure why they would choose this section, since it‚Äôs one of the easier sections we‚Äôve done so far. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èWe had made it to the Abingdon Gap Shelter by 3pm, the next water source was almost 5 miles up trail, so had to make the journey down to the creek before we headed out. The creek was only 0.3 miles behind the shelter but man was it steep, it‚Äôs pretty bad when the climb back up from a water source is your biggest climb of the day. After we filled up we ventured up trail looking for decent campsite for the night. Went up about 2 more miles to a site for three, a fire pit and a beautiful sittin log, you guys think it‚Äôs funny, but a good log to sit on out here is like gold. Got into camp about 4:30, a little earlier than normal, so we took the time to build a fire and chill. Thanks for all the love and Support. üèïüö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚õ∞ Hike on...

I realized halfway through the day that I had 14 miles to make in the next 5 hours if I wanted to hit up the Elkwallow Wayside before it closed. So I pumped up Carly Rae Jepsen and hauled ass up one hill and down another, dodging swarms of gnats and leaping over blowdowns.<br><br>I raised my trekking poles in triumph as I walked up to Lightfoot and Recon at the wayside, then ordered three sandwiches and an ice cream.<br><br>We only had enough motivation to hike out from the wayside to the nearest flat space for our tents. That flat space was occupied by 25 boyscouts all crammed together! They tipped us off to an unoccupied forest service cabin just down the hill, and we set up camp on the porch. It was a memorable evening of building a fort and having a sleepover, staying up late telling stories with Recon and Lightfoot ü§ó

I stopped to read every park info sign, I went for a dip in a creek, I moseyed up and down hills and took breaks to eat instead of doing it on the go. I met a very friendly deer, saw some incredible views of the lush green Shenandoah, and still made it to the same place as everyone else by the end of the day.<br><br>There‚Äôs a weird cast of characters at this shelter. It‚Äôs a mix of weekenders, sectioners, and thru-hikers. There‚Äôs a hobo with slow, twisted facial expressions interrogating Mr. Toast, and a whacked-out guy Dustin burning plastic in the fire and throwing his shit all over the place. Then someone mentions that one of the sectioners snores, and I decide after such a peaceful day I‚Äôd better end it with a peaceful night of setting up my tent and spending the evening camped out in solitude.<br><br>The next day is rainy, all the waysides we looked forward to are still closed for the season, and I have a quiet struggle with the monotony of the trail. We‚Äôre 95 miles from Harper‚Äôs Ferry, and I wish I had something motivating or inspiring to say...but I‚Äôm just bored. And then I remember that one thing the trail reminds us of (or teaches us) is HOW to be bored and lean into that boredom.

Started the day with a great hike to Laurel Falls (pictured) and passed by some awesome camp sites along the way. Got to our first major climb of the day, about 2000ft of elevation gain in less than 2 miles. It was pretty steep in sections but for the most part was switchback after switchback followed by false summit after false summit. After those zero days the legs just didn‚Äôt want to get going. What goes up, must go down, we didn‚Äôt even get a nice view at the summit, just a ‚Äúhey your at the top, now go back down‚Äù. üòí once we hit the bottom, we passed by Shook Branch Recreation Area and stopped to take a lunch.

My feet were in pretty rough shape by this time, but they had been hurting for most of the day, gotta get em back in hiker shape. ü§£ all of us were wining and moaning going up that hill, and were looking for camp spots to stop at, it always seems like when you‚Äôre looking for a spot they‚Äôre just never around, but could pass 20 of them on the way there. üòí We passed by 2 full campsites and finally found a little clearing big enough for three tents (433.5). Looks like we have a cold front coming through, windy and cold tonight, think 41 degrees is what they‚Äôre saying, haven‚Äôt had my long underwear on in at least 2 weeks. Good night everyone.

Not only are the rhododendrons blooming, we also crossed the 500 mile marker AND 1/4th completion mark of the trail this past week. We're beginning to fall into the groove of higher mileage days, and have been lucky enough to have a wonderful and supportive group of hikers around us while we experience the ups and the downs of trail life.

Sadness and disbelief have been in the air this weekend among the AT community in wake of what happened. And we are among those who are feeling it. But we want you all to know that we are okay. We are far enough north that we luckily never met the man who did this. We have never felt unsafe on the trail before, and want to advocate that this trail is overall a very safe and loving place to be. We are hiking on. Expecting justice. And hoping that the reputation of the trail stays true and untarnished. .<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #appalachianthruhike #atclassof2019 #atnobo #atnobo2019 #thruhike #optoutside #hikerhunger #hikertrash #appalachiantrail2019 #hikerfeed

Just wanted to provide a status update for today and tomorrow. going to take two more zero days here in Hampton for two reasons.<br><br>Reason 1- The weather has been pretty crappy all day today. This morning I had packed up all my gear and headed to the trail head with the intention to hike on. I had gotten to the trail head and meet up with a few other hikers and showed me the weather forecast. The next 2 days have scattered thunderstorms all day. not too big of a deal but the next reason pretty much solidified our decision.<br><br>Reason 2- I'm not getting into to much detail about it, you can google it if you want. Don't want to spread the rumor mill more than it already is. Yesterday there was an individual on the trail (not a thru hiker) who had gotten into a confrontation with 2 other thru hikers just north of Damascus, VA. It escalated and the police got involved, the individual is currently in custody. For the safety of thru hikers, that 20 mile section of trail is closed until further notice. That section of trail is about 3-4 days north of us. So we are deciding to sit and chill until the trail reopens. It sucks that one individual can cause such a ruckus on what in my experience has been a super safe trail. All the thru hikers have banded together to help support those involved and those in the vicinity. <br>Thanks everyone for the Support and please don't think that this trail is anything but safe. A few bad apples shouldn't tarnish what makes this trail great, the people! Thanks for all the love and support.

This is the montage of our last few days. The town of Glasgow has been kind to us. It seems to mark a turning point in our hike, where our perspective made a big shift from "having a duty" to "enjoying a journey." And goodness do we feel a weight off of our shoulders because of it. We wouldn't be surprised if this new outlook, though it might seem counterintuitive, leads to bigger miles and happier hikes. Our goal is to enjoy the hell out of these 6 months. Sunshine has been working out dozens of knots in each foot and resting them like it's her job. Bluegrass is kind and supportive and playful as ever... Having fun shooting Sunshine with his watergun when she is too crippled to run away. That's okay. She will just keep shooting him from the safe zone (her quilt) where he isn't allowed to retaliate. 800 miles is around the corner. We have more long climbs and thunderstorms in our future, but we are hiking out tomorrow.

But we like to call him "turtle dog" because he loves to roll on his back when his dad takes his pack off for the day. He wants you to throw the stick, but he won't let you have the stick. No take, only throw. He is an adept hiker with the advantages of an extra pair of legs, a low center of gravity, and absolute positivity and eagerness. He leaps over logs like a deer when he gets the zoomies. He will eat your beef sticks if you offer them. He throws a minor tantrum when Dad puts his pack on in the morning, but it's clear that he loves to hike and is pretty darn good at it. Jasper has tons of energy, even after a long day. He inspires us because we know that if Jasper can do it, we can do it!<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #appalachianthruhike #atclassof2019 #atnobo #atnobo2019 #thruhike #optoutside #hikerhunger #hikertrash #appalachiantrail2019 #hikerfeed

This is Bucket List. He got his trail name from a Goodwill TShirt he no longer wears. He's hiking the AT the good old fashioned way: no shelters, no hostels, no fuel, no smart phone, and no AWOL guide. He figures out his plan by here-say along the trail of what's coming up as far as water sources and tenting. He uses a wood burning stove to cook his meals, so the rain has an interesting impact on his diet. He is the opposite of ultralight. He has taken 5 showers so far, but 4 of them were in one day. He is a resilient hiker who can put up with a fair amount of suck with a smile on his face. He hiked 54 miles in 24 hours just for funsies, then partied hard that night. He has a goofy and lighthearted sense of humor that has given us tons of laughs already. We also think he is immune to poison ivy and giardia. .<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #appalachianthruhike #atclassof2019 #atnobo #atnobo2019 #thruhike #optoutside #hikerhunger #hikertrash #appalachiantrail2019 #hikerfeed

Thank you so much for the way you responded with encouragement, love, and support on my last post. (Sunshine here). Yesterday was a hard day. Our hardest yet. Even if my head was in the game (which it certainly wasn't), it would have been a tough day. It was hot and humid and we had TONS of climbs. I don't think we've ever sweat so much! But having the idea of quitting bouncing around in my head for the first time ever, along with feelings of total inadequacy and shame for not being a stronger hiker- that was nearly crippling. I stopped a lot more than I usually do on the climbs. I sat more. I cried more. I barely talked to Blue all day. I kept thinking about what I should do. Hike on and hurt everyday? Or stop now and hurt everyday after, for not getting to Katahdin? We actually got to a shelter to take a break around 3:30, and I had fully accepted that maybe I should just do a low mile day and sleep there for the night to regroup. But there were two men there who were very negative, competitive, and talking poorly about other hikers. I didn't want to be around that when I was feeling so fragile. So I told Bluegrass I'd like to press on another 5.3 miles to the next shelter. And we did. And it was in those last 5 miles (which weren't easy, btw) that I remembered a card I made for myself on days like this, when I felt like giving up, to remind me of why I'm doing this. One of the reasons says "to have a strong body and mind." My feet might be weak. But a person with a strong mind, what would they do? They would press on even when they are hot and sweaty and cryish and their entire day is uphill. They would add 5 miles to their day when they are at their worst, just to be around positive people instead of crabby ones. My feet can be what they are. But I do have a strong mind. And a person with a strong mind wouldn't quit on a bad day. And I didn't either. ‚ô•Ô∏è Thank you all for telling us that you are rooting for us and believe in us. You all helped me climb mountains.

Stayed at Mountain Harbour B&B/hostel last night cause of all the good reviews for their breakfast. Oooh weee!! It was simply amazing! Homemade biscuits and gravy, scrambled eggs with cheese, bacon, ham, strawberries, berry danish and cupcakes. Hands down best breakfast I‚Äôve had in over a month. After that deliciousness i got back in trail about 9am. Of course being in a gap the only way out is up, not much of a climb though, maybe 1000ft. At the top was a nice open ridge with views of the surrounding area, some nice lush grass land. Past Isaacs Cemetery, would have been real creepy at night. There were lots of day hikers out heading to Jones Falls. Cool water fall right off trail. Probably 50 to 60 feet high with water running off the shale rock, which is abundant around here. After i hit the 400 miles marker, still can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve walked 400 miles, only 1,790 miles to go. üòé took a quick lunch at Elk River. The trail runs beside it for a half mile and it‚Äôs pretty clear, allot if people swimming in it. I went up to test it with my big toe, nope, to damn cold! ü•∂ after that it was pretty much just bleh for the rest of the day. Felt like i was in the green tunnel, walking through rhododendron forests. Camp is set up, have few neighbors tonight, some young college kids, they better not be up all night blaring their Post Malone crap! ü§£üòâ plan for tomorrow is to get up early and head into Hampton, TN. Supposed to rain the next few days so fingers crossed it scoots by us.

Hiked on, knowing there was a storm rolling in, and got trapped on a ridge with lightning coming from every direction. I bailed to a shelter for a few hours, then made 6 more miles once the rain let up for a short 13-mile day. On the positive, my campsite exactly at mile 600 was peaceful and breezy with a gorgeous view of rural Virginia. Camping alone provides refreshing solitude.

I am discouraged. My plantar fasciitis is very severe. I've tried it all. Stretching, massaging, insoles, better shoes, turmeric, ibuprofen, KT tape, cold soaking, hot soaking, CBD, compression socks, Epsom salts, you name it. The truth is, my feet are going to hurt until I stop hiking. I haven't felt my right big toe in over a month. My plantar fascia is so tight it causes my toes to curl, and they crack when I straighten them. The lightning in my feet keeps me awake at night. Toward the end of every day my pain becomes so great that I often am limping and holding back tears by the time I get to camp. I like to think I'm a tough cookie and I've been accused of having a high pain tolerance... But this is no joke. But even though this is the most painful thing I've ever experienced, the hardest part of it all isn't the pain- it's the mental aspect. I feel guilty, like Bluegrass would be in Harper's Ferry by now if it weren't for me slowing him down. I feel shame, when other hikers ask when we started and they realize how slow we've been and how behind we are. I struggle to enjoy hiking or look forward to it at all when I associate it with feeling miserable. I feel angry when I have the hundredth conversation with a stranger who thinks they can tell me how to cure my PF and I tell them "yeah, I tried that." The truth is, we saved up enough money to hike for 6 months. I am doing my best and pushing myself to tears almost every day, but the chances of us summiting Katahdin before we run out of funding is slim because I can only go so far. Hiking faster or further isn't really an option. If I am going to enjoy this hike and be able to complete it, I need more time. And I don't have it. I try very hard to stay positive and enjoy everything I can during my hikes... To not worry about pace/money/time and to just do my best. But it's very hard not to obsess over "how many miles do I have left to camp" when I know camp is the only time I'm remotely comfortable. Anyway, thanks for joining my pity party. It's just that we've been very candid with you all on his hike, and I didn't think we should stop now.

So that amazing few I showed everyone yesterday with the amazing sunrise. Yea, that didn‚Äôt happen. The clouds rolled in about 1am and brought the wind with it. Woke up every 15 minutes to the wind pile driving my tent. It finally cooled off a little around 6am but still had some strong gusts. Had breakfast and coffee and quickly tried to take down the tent, it was a chore with the wind. The first hour of hiking was a white out, sucks cause there were some good views, just couldn‚Äôt see em. Made it to Little Hump Mountain (388.1), about 6 miles in and things began to clear up. Being in the Roan Highlands, which is a series of five mountains with balds on top, makes the views go on forever. Made the climb up to Hump Mountain (391.8) and enjoyed the view with a little lunch (pictured earlier). Best place EVER to take a lunch. From here it was all down hill, passing the Doll Flats which is the TN/NC border. That means today was the last time I‚Äôll step foot in NC while on the AT. Two states down, twelve to go! Wooo!! Continued down the rock infested trail for another 2 miles and reached US 19E. I‚Äôve been hearing about the amazing breakfast at Mountain Harbor Hostel. Debated heading that way, but it was only 0.3 miles off trail, why not! Got a tent site for $10 and a shower. Bought 2 burgers with fries from the food truck here, yes, they have a food trucküòÇüòç. This place is pretty cool, they turned an old barn into a B&B/hostel. Plan is to eat some amazing breakfast in the morning and get back on trail. Next few days should be good as far as elevation goes. Have a good night.

Woke up about 7am and started breakfast. The body really didn‚Äôt want to get up, felt pretty content in the ole sleeping bag. Finally about 8ish i put my wet socks and shoes on and packed everything up, got it down to about 5 minutes. Stayed at a nice campsite in an open meadow. Made it to greasy creek gap about 11. Greasy Creek Hostel was about 0.6 miles off trail, thought about getting some lunch but kept chugging along. Had my first 1000 ft climb of the day just after Hughes Gap (4040elv). It was pretty steep at sections with the trail being mainly log steps. Got to a beautiful campsite at Ash Gap (5350elv), almost set up camp there it was so nice. Continued on my next climb up to Roan Mountain (6190elv). This was allot of boulder climbing and rock gardens. Luckily I didn‚Äôt have to do this yesterday when it was raining, it would have been miserable. Made on top of Roan Mountain and hit up the highest shelter on the AT, Roan High Knob Shelter (6186elv). Originally planned to stay there tonight but it was too crowded. Headed down the backside of Roan and enjoyed a very dense pine tree forrest, the smell of pine was intense. Got down to Carver Gap about 6ish and made my way up to Round Bald. I‚Äôm so glad I didn‚Äôt decide to stay at the shelter, the view up here is awesome. Pitched my tent on the summit and started dinner. Again, this view i have right outside my tent is killer. It‚Äôs gunna be a great sunrise. Have a good night.

Altra has a cult following among hikers because, all-in-all, they make a good shoe. We've all been waiting for a trail runner that is actually foot shaped and wide for our swelling and splayed feet. However! Until Altra makes a shoe that can stand up to more than 200 miles before completely falling apart, we don't intend to purchase another pair from them. It is very common to hear hikers say they love everything about their Altras except their total lack of durability. Blue had these Timps for less than two weeks/200 miles when he noticed holes on the inside (a place where they commonly blow out). Sunshine's Salomon Odyssey Triple Crowns looked better at 600 miles than Blue's Altra Timps did at 200. (And they are just as wide as the Altras.) He's sewn together two pairs of Altras with floss on the trail, and so have many other hikers. These trail runners might be great for running at home, but if you plan to wear them on the AT, be prepared with double the shoe budget because you'll be replacing them often. @altrarunning  @salomonrunning @salomon<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#shameshame #badreview #disappointed #trailrunners  #appalachiantrail #appalachianthruhike #atclassof2019 #atnobo #atnobo2019 #thruhike #optoutside #hikerhunger #hikertrash #appalachiantrail2019 #hikerfeed

There is a commonly used phrase out here: "making miles." As in, "I don't stop for lunch because I got miles to make." I don't want to get caught up in semantics, but I don't like this phrase at all. Us hikers are not "making" anything that didn't or couldn't exist without us. The mountains and the miles between them have always been there, and always will be. We are lucky that our feet get to pass over them. Everyone has their own reasons for hiking the AT. Getting to Katahdin as fast as possible is one of them, I guess. But to take such a life-changing and potentially spiritual experience and turn it into a competitive one is not our style. It tends to be a goal among the younger hikers on the trail. They compare miles and talk proudly of how much they did that day. And good for them! But for us, we'd rather be asked what we saw that day or what our favorite moment was. We aren't "making" anything...

Woke up about 2am as usual to pee, ate a snack and fell right back to sleep. Woke up about 6am to the pitter patter of rain, pulled my sleeping bag over my head and slept for another hour. About 7am, fired up the Jetboil to make some coffee. I got some instant carnation mix from my moms resupply while in Erwin. Thought it would be good to mix in my coffee to get some needed vitamins and minerals in the morning. That was a game changer, it tasted so good! üòä i sat in my tent until 10 or so waiting for the rain to stop. I had decent cell signal so kept an eye on the radar. Finally the rain stopped for a bit and quickly packed everything up. It was a later start than usual but was still looking to hit 15 miles for the day, even if it meant night hiking. Started the morning with a nice up hill, nothing major, just enough to get the legs loose. About a half hour in, it started raining, just a little sprinkle at first then a good steady rain. It rained for most of the day, the trail looked more like a stream than it did a walking path. Got up to Beauty Spot Gap about 1ish. It was a clearing on top of a mountain. The rain and wind up there was crazy. The wind and rain was blowing from the left, to keep the wind and rain from my face and to keep the hood of my rain jacket down i was literally walking crooked trying to shield myself. Once i was in the tree line again things got better. About 100 feet in was some trail magic. They were just packing things up as i rolled in, got a diet coke and two twix bars. Made the climb up Unaka Mountain (5180elv) soaking wet. i forgot to take a lunch, it had been raining all day and once I stopped hiking i got cold, so i just kept going until i reached the next shelter. I got to Cherry Gap Shelter about 4pm and the rain had finally stopped. Met a few thru hikers from Erwin that had just changed and gotten dry. I pulled out a few snacks and carried on. Hiked another 5 miles to an unnamed campsite in a little clearing about 7. Gear dried out a little from hiking but is still a little damp. It was just one of those head down foot forward days. Thanks for all the love and support. Hike on.

We've waited awhile for these. We are enjoying feeling strong and upping our mileage. It makes it fun to set short-term goals and meet them. Seeing the 700 mile mark had us specifically thinking about that... How so many steps in a day turn into miles and so many days in a row turn into hundreds of miles. There's been a sense of celebration in the air lately about how far we've come. Bluegrass is particularly jazzed that we are 1/3 through. We could be worried about pace/money/time, but we are choosing not to. We are enjoying the experience and celebrating what we've shown that we are able to do. We are enjoying the people, the pups, and the budding flowers. Sunshine saw rhododendron in bloom for the first time ever... Something we consider nothing more than an invasive weed at home. It was nice to get a new appreciation for it. She's also newly in love with the smell of pine needles under the heat of the sun. She will stop mid-stride to breathe as much of it in as she can. We've loved hiking with Papa Bear and growing our tramily. We've enjoyed the simplest trail magic, such as a Coca-Cola and a chair by a stream on a hot day. As well as the most personal trail magic, such as Jimmy waiting for us at the end of a pasture to surprise us with snacks and slackpacking. The sense of community and love on the trail continues to be the AT's most beautiful trait. And now, after walking 200 miles in two weeks, we are enjoying a restful zero with copious amounts of carbs and perfectly mediocre hotel cable. We feel so lucky to have a chance at this adventure. To grow so much as a couple and as individuals. The AT will give you so much joy and new strength if you let it.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #appalachianthruhike #atclassof2019 #atnobo #atnobo2019 #thruhike #optoutside #hikerhunger #hikertrash #appalachiantrail2019 #hikerfeed

Finding camping was a bit difficult because we passed through a lot of restrictive areas. A chemical plant, a landfill, a 7 mile switchbacked section with few flat spots for tents, and no water sources for 10+ miles at a time. We pitched our tents near roads and highways a couple times and missed the quiet peaceful woods, where we feel like we belong. With the heat came humidity, bugs, poison ivy, some sleepless nights, and needing to camel up and carry extra water between water sources. We have never been so sweaty. Sunshine's sleeping pad is leaking faster and faster each night, and we weren't able to fix it in the mountains without a bathtub or soapy water to help find the holes. Bluegrass has been Mr.Fix-it between the sleeping pad and his shoes... Yes, the ones he just got 200 miles ago. We will make another post on this later, but we are pretty disappointed with how poorly Altras hold up on the trail. We pushed ourselves on miles this week, and our bodies are showing it. Sunshine has a split toe, poison ivy all over her body, some boo-boos, and wicked sore knees and feet. Bluegrass has ferocious allergies and achy hips. (He wins).

Headed into downtown Erwin for some free blueberry pancakes, which were delicious. Erwin was having there Trail Days this weekend. They had the downtown area closed and allot of vendors and live music. Made it really hard to leave, contemplated staying another day just to enjoy the festivities. Was watching the weather radar and seen a line of storms heading our way. It was about noon at the time and storms weren‚Äôt expected to hit until 6ish, so i headed out. Was looking to hit a campsite about 10 miles outside Erwin. If i kept a good pace i could make it. It was about 4:30pm when i could hear the thunder roll (garth brooks) and was still about 4 miles out. Thoughts were going threw my head ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not gunna make it, find the next flat spot‚Äù. About 15 minutes later it started drizzling, then a little more, then a little more. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not gunna make it‚Äù ü§¨ i was on a ridge about halfway up the mountain. If i looked left, straight down, if i looked right, straight up. It wasn‚Äôt the ideal camping spot. About 10 minutes later the sky let loose and just down poured. I got lucky though, at the next bend was a campsite right before Indian Grave Gap. Quickly set my tent up (probably the quickest I‚Äôve ever set it up) and threw all my soaking wet gear inside. It rained for an hour then the sun came out. Currently drying my gear before the next wave comes through at 10ish.

This time I want to start our update with #theugly ... Or really, the beautiful. <br>Like all other aspects of our marriage, the AT is not just a shared journey. It's also an individual one. We support each other the best we can, but our own feet have to walk the miles. Blue has his unique struggles with the trail and I have mine. One thing we didn't expect was how hard it would be to watch each other work through those struggles independently. On the day of this picture, my feet were in new kinds of pain. I pushed my trail runners too far (600 miles) and they were toast. It was getting late in the day and the clouds were looking threatening. We reached the base of a steep climb and I asked Blue to tell me how many more miles to camp. "Three," he said. "We are at the base of our last climb." I couldn't hold back my tears. I didn't feel like I had three more miles. I didn't want to climb in the rain. I asked him for some pain meds and he kindly dropped pack to dig them out for me. I swallowed them fast and before he could put his pack back on, I was long gone. I turned on my most motivating music and pushed as hard as I could. Just then, it POURED down rain. I don't know how I found the mental fortutude to climb that mountain as fast as I did in the downpour, or to ignore the pain throbbing in my shoes. But I did. What I didn't know, was that Blue was trying desperately to catch me. His only thought was that he didn't want me facing that battle alone. Even if he couldn't fix it for me, he wanted to be there. He caught me almost at the top, breathing ragged and with new pains of his own for pushing so hard. We finished the climb together. At the top, we enjoyed the view in silence. Until he tearfully said "I'm so sorry you hurt." We shared a good cry and I took this picture to remember the moment. Not of the view, but of us. Because we are the journey. The trail gets real ugly sometimes, but after a few days I find those ugly moments to be the most beautiful. Later that night I realized: this man is my own Katahdin. I could walk 700 miles of this trail, or 2,192. My holy mountain is walking right behind me, every step of the way.

We'll be taking a zero day today - meaning we won't hike any miles - in order to resupply our food and get some much needed mental respite. Virginia is the longest state on the AT...around 500 miles.

It wasn‚Äôt strong, just a consistent wind, probably 5-10 mph. We camped about 0.1 miles up from Low Gap on the ridge. Campsites were a little lower into the gap but nothing was flat, plus the wind wasn‚Äôt as prominent. Headed out of camp about 9ish and made the 1300ft climb to Big Bald Mountain (5516elv). Had an awesome 360 degree view of the world. It‚Äôs funny how ripples in the earth can be so beautiful. üòÜ Didn‚Äôt stay long, the wind was pretty bad today. Headed over to Big Stamp which is a treeless ridge. Saw a few deer that didn‚Äôt care at all that i was there. ü§£ from there it was down hill to Whistling Gap. Took the pack off and had some lunch, couscous with some extra ramen noodles i had. Meh, it worked ok. I made it to Spivey Gap (333.1) about 2:30pm and started what i thought was my last climb of the day. About half way up I stopped at a water source to wash some of the sweat off my face. As i was doing that a dog walks up, lays right in the stream and starts gulping down water, i just looked at and said ‚Äúyup, i know how you feel buddy!‚Äù. The digs owner showed up a little later, she was slackpacking into Erwin for the day. For the next 2 miles i had a little buddy to hike with, it was great. üòé I got to No Business Knob Shelter about 4ish and didn‚Äôt see Seven, so I continued on. The plan was to camp a little past the shelter to have a shorter hike into Erwin tomorrow morning. Got to Temple Hill Gap, about two miles past the shelter, no Seven. Made another climb up to the summit around 6ish and found a pretty good site just off the trail. Long day, but means only 3 miles into town in the morning. üòÅ gunna hit up Subway and demolish two footlong subs, can‚Äôt wait! ü§§ have a great night everyone.

It was so humid last night that everything just stuck to me. I slept with one leg out, one leg in and every time i turned my face stuck to my pillow. üòÇ I‚Äôm not sure what they were but sounded like some coyotes howling last night about midnight. Sounded like a pack if them, howled for about 10 minutes then gone. Kept one eye open for the rest of the morning. üßê started the morning with a nice 1500ft climb up to Lick Rock summit. I don‚Äôt mind having big climbs in the morning, gets the blood pumping. ü§™ from there it was a few ups and downs, nothing major. Made it to Sams Gap about  1ish. It passes under interstate 26 into Tennessee. Caught up with Seven and had lunch underneath the overpass. There was a gas station and cafe about 3 miles down the road. We seriously contemplated heading down, but decided to keep trekking on instead. The climb out of Sams Gap SUCKED! I think it was about 1200ft but it was STEEP. My calves were so sore when i reached the top, but was greeted with a wide open prairie. Wide open view of the mountains and thigh high grass just flowing in the wind, absolutely beautiful. I sat down for about 10 minutes to soak it all in. Thats one i will never forget. After that we headed down to Low Gap Campsite (323.4) and set up camp.

Half the day was spent listening to the whooshing of my blood running through my ears, extreme sweating and wondering when my heart was going to burst through my chest. It was hot and very little water, so I had to carry more then usual.  Over 7 miles uphill, steep.  Today really tested the saying, ‚ÄúA bad day on the trail is better then a good day at work.‚Äù As I lay here in my tent, I am looking forward to sleep, resting my legs and thankful for the weather because doing this climb in the rain would have made it so much more difficult.  I definitely feel stronger as the days go on, however once and a while a day comes along and reminds you that you have limits and walls.  Apparently we are human.

Had a pop tart and made some coffee without ever getting up, üòÇ it was like breakfast in bed, but my bed is an air mattress and my breakfast wasn‚Äôt pancakes. üôÑ got all packed up and headed out by 8:30am. i think sevan is very meticulously trying to turn me into an early riser. ü§£‚òïÔ∏è Had a little climb up to Big Firescald Knob with a great view. The trail was on the ridge line for about a mile after that. I wouldn‚Äôt call it a trail, more like a bunch of bloody big rocks that the trail crews happened to stack other rocks on top of each other, so you could get on TOP of the bloody big rock/boulders. üòÇüò≥ It was a good change of pace though from the last few days, and hit that BIG OLE 300 mile marker. ü§ò From there it was a little up and down until we made it to Big Butt Mountain. I think it was called that because there was a huge boulder with a crack down the middle resembling a buttocks. üòâ I caught up to Sevan around 3ish and we found a campsite just south of Devil Fork Gap (311.1). Set up camp real quick and headed up to Laurel Hostel which was 0.5 miles up trail. We had a beer and mingled with a bunch of thru hikers eating pizza and drinking beers. Campfinder was already here when we got back, but he wanted to knock a little of the climb we have tomorrow out. I don‚Äôt blame him, it‚Äôs gunna be rough. ü§í watching the sunset as i type this, it‚Äôs gunna be a good night. ‚òÄÔ∏è Have a great night.

It was a 0.6 mile hike off trail and wasn‚Äôt sure if it would be worth it, but it was. They had a really nice setup where you could cook pizzas or cheese burgers if you wanted. I ended up grabbing two bacon cheese burgers and two diet pepsis and mowed em all down. If you‚Äôre ever passing through check em out, really nice people. Of course after that we had a 2000ft climb up to Camp Creek Bald. On a full stomach that really sucked. ü§¢ got into camp about 5ish for a 14 mile day. It feels as though I‚Äôm finally getting my trail legs. The climbs the last few days have been tough, but have been able to get through em with less breaks.

Of course there was a nice climb to start the day off, pretty steep. After that it was decent, no major climbs until the last 2 miles before camp. My legs felt great today, killed the uphill even with a full pack of food. Got a total of 10 miles in today. We camped on Rich Mountain (283.2) which has a nice fire tower with some epic views.

The first 5 miles were nice, a little up and down but most of it flat. It was still overcast and got a few rain showers off and on until about 11:30am. Made it to Walnut Mountain Shelter about 12:15pm and had a quick lunch. I had a few tortillas left, so pulled out some almond butter, pepperoni slices and some tomato basil tuna. Weird combination i know, but it was good. üòù had a little decent into Kale Gap, then a 500ft climb up to Buff Mountain. Got into Deer Park Mountain Shelter(271.1) around 5:30. We were trying to find a campsite before the shelter but the pickings were very slim. We found a few tent pads away from the shelter but still close enough to use the privy. üí© all in all it was a good day. Put in a little more than 16 miles, which leaves us with a 4-5 mile hike into Hot Springs in the morning. üòÅ hopefully be there by breakfast.

We figured it was about time for another update. #thegood - miles are coming fast these days and our gear is working really well. We are enjoying our lighter summer packs! Sunshine's plantar fasciitis has been more manageable thanks to compression socks sent by @jo_meyers and stopping every 5 miles or so to massage or soak in a cold stream. It still hurts everyday, but not as bad as it was. Virginia has been beautiful and green. We love seeing the trees wake up and the flowers come out, which is always a positive aspect of all the rain that comes with spring. We are so tired of seeing brown, dead leaves and naked trees... So come on spring! We stayed at Long Neck Lair in Atkins and enjoyed using their kitchen to make a big breakfast. We've been hiking with Papa Bear and really enjoying his company. (Hiker Spotlight soon) #thebad - this heat, man. Days that wouldn't have been tough in cooler temperatures are much harder with the sun sucking your energy dry. There isn't much tree cover so sunburns are bound to happen even with hats and sunscreen. We've been going for long stretches without any water sources too. So we "camel up" at streams and are trying hard to stay hydrated. Also, everyone who told us "Virginia is flat" can kiss our butts. #theugly - Virginia Blues...ugh!

Ok he didn‚Äôt show up with McDonalds but it‚Äôd be cool if he did. ü§£ he pulled in almost 23 miles the day before to catch up to us, he killed it. Today was a total grind fest. We went up hill, ALL. DAMN. DAY. üò¨ it was pretty warm today also, so the sweat was just pouring off me. We took allot of breaks and made sure we had plenty of water at all times. I think in total we climbed about 5000ft today. We finally made it to Max Patch (255.1) which is a mountain that was cleared for cattle, but is now maintained as a bald. We got in about 5:30 hung up our clothes to dry and proceeded to stuff our faces. With the all day grind none of us ate much. After dinner we trekked back up to Max Patch to watch the sunset (pictured). Were planning on a 14 mile day tomorrow to get us within 4 miles on Hot Springs, NC. We‚Äôll see how that goes, have allot more climbs between here and town.

Woke to the rustling of the early birds packing there stuff. It got cold last night and  i was all fine and comfy in my sleeping bag.

On my way down i seen this little guy, he was just doing his thing. There was remnants of a old plane crash about a quarter of a mile down. Not sure when or how but it looked rather new, within the last 10 years. From here on out it was down hill until Cosby Knob Shelter. (mile 231.1) this will hopefully be my last night in the Smokeys. It‚Äôs been great but the rules they have here are kinda bogus. üòí but this shelter has some pretty nice tent pads. Headed up Mt. Cammerer in the mourning, heard of a nice view from there.

We weren‚Äôt sure if the road to Newfound Gap was going to open today, it was still pretty cold in the higher elevations. We made a secondary option of skipping ahead 30 miles the Davenport Gap, which would have taken us to the northern border of the Smokey Mountains just incase the road didn‚Äôt open. By 11oclock we had found out that the rangers had opened it. Called an Uber to get us to the trail. Was surprised that they would take us that far. Got to the trail about noon, and it was cold. Still allot of snow and ice on the trees. The sun peeked it‚Äôs beautiful self for a while but as we went higher in elevation, we got stuck in the clouds. Most if the views were socked in (fogged in) and made it pretty uneventful. Sucks cause we passed a handful of nice peaks. With the warmish temps and the wind blowing allot of the snow and ice on the trees came crashing down. Had some pretty big chunks crack me in the head. Just gotta follow the 5 D‚Äôs rule, dip, dive, dodge, duck and dodge. Got into the shelter about 5:30pm and tried drying my gear. The sun had cone back out but it was cold and didn‚Äôt dry much.

After hiking through both, we think Roan takes the cake quite easily. Grayson gives you ponies and views, but also rocks and mud and poorly blazed trail.

This is the only picture we have of it, because we aren't prone to taking our phones out in heavy downpour to seize a photo-op. When the heavy rains turned into a mere sprinkle I asked Bluegrass to take a picture of how GREEN the forest was. This picture doesn't do justice. But I digress. Our day started with awful sleep due to a leaking sleeping pad  and then waking to realize that the stormy winds twisted up our bear line and left our food bags stuck on the limb. Neither of us would call it a smooth morning. Neither of us wanted to hike in the rain. But we told ourselves (and each other) that we did it in Georgia, and we can do it today. So on we went. At first we embraced the suck, laughed as the rain came down even harder, and splashed in the puddles instead of walking around them because we were already as wet as wet can get. We hiked a fast 9.2 miles to the next shelter, and it was actually the first one we've seen since the Smokies that had a working fireplace in it. Just what we needed. We ate our tuna and pepperoni and warmed our hands by the fire. It was hard to walk away from a warm and dry place, but we chose to hike on, another 9.8 to the next shelter. This is when the suck started to embrace us instead. Our hands were so water logged that our pruny skin was turning white and flaking off. I had (have) a sharp pain in my cervical spine between my shoulders that feels like a hot poker. My plantar fasciitis wasn't happy. Blue developed a blister. Our shoes were so flooded that the water created a suction that stuck our feet to the bottom of our shoes. We tripped. We fell. Our muscles locked up. We stopped in the middle of the trail because we just didn't want to walk anymore. But we also sang songs. We ate combos in silence and laughed together about how much this sucks. And we did it. 19 miles might not be a lot to some hikers, but to us it's a PR. Yesterday reminded us that we can be so strong together when we dive headfirst into the suck and choose to make the most of it. The worst days really do make the best stories.

Max Patch is a bald that is so flat and so long, that they used to land planes on it! We also did some crazy hiking along Interstate 40 (shoutout to the truckers who honked us along) and then completed a grueling two days (14 miles/20 miles) with a descent into Hot Springs, NC. The trail actually runs right through downtown Hot Springs, which is why the last picture of our bunch has the AT logo paved into the sidewalk.

We were treated to some spectacular views and had one AMAZING (albeit cold) day hiking above the frost line - as you'll see from the pictures. The Mt. Cammerer fire tower and Charlie's Bunion now represent two of our favorite destinations in the Smokey's, but the hiking in general was spectacular.

Man there was allot of people out there. üò≥ Woke up early and got back on trail by 7:30am. Had a beautiful morning hike threw some pine tree forests. It was a good change of scenery from what we‚Äôve seen the past few days. Had about a 5 mile hike into Newfound Gap where we caught a shuttle into Gatlinburg, TN. The first Baptist Church does daily shuttle rides into town everyday, that was super cool. üò¨ we got dropped off at the NOC outdoor center about 2pm. MAN!! What a culture shock this place was. Gatlinburg is a HUGE tourist town and it was BUSY AF. One good thing about this tourist town is you have plenty of options to stuff your face. üòµ we stopped at Ole Smokeys Moonshine and had ourselves a little taste test of 13 different flavors. All of it, good ü§£. Got laundry done, resupply done and shower done. The plan is to head out in the morning and hike 12 miles to Tri-Corner Knob Shelter, if the weather holds. The line of storms that hit Mississippi and Alabama today is supposed to hit us in the morning. If it‚Äôs just rain we‚Äôll head out, but if the winds continue we might have to make a decision. Hopefully it‚Äôs just rain cause i really don‚Äôt feel like taking a zero, AGAIN.

I‚Äôm out here - I‚Äôm alive - all is well! üòç This has been an incredible four days. I really couldn‚Äôt have asked for better weather. The terrain is brutal. Totally fucking brutal (especially for this flat lander girl who is not so used to climbing mountains all day long). But the sense of accomplishment at the end of a long, hard day makes all the sweat and struggle worth it. I‚Äôm just gonna hold on to the promise that I‚Äôll eventually develop ‚Äútrail legs‚Äù at which point, the game becomes a little less physical and a lot more mental.<br>::<br>In terms of mileage, we‚Äôre moving pretty slow - trying hard to keep our knees and feet healthy and not overdue it. Due to severe weather moving in tonight and slated to hang around all day tomorrow, most of us got off trail to rest up. Five of us are here at Barefoot Hills - eating pizza, drinking coke, and taking our first showers in way too many days.<br>::<br>Which brings me to the people! Who are by far the best part about this epic journey. Against all odds, I ran into @abigail_bowers and @al_pie3 right smack dab at the bottom of a gap on Day 2. They‚Äôre sisters from Michigan who are also thru-hiking this season and they‚Äôre total sweethearts. And also Russ (trail name Ragnar) who hikes exactly my pace. He‚Äôs super chill and easy-going and owns a potbelly pig named Lulu and a snake and bees and talks with a slow, calming southern drawl. I dig his stories and his ability to stay positive. I think we maybe have the beginnings of a tramily (trail family).<br>::<br>I‚Äôll post another update in a few days ‚úåüèº‚ú®üçÉ<br>::<br>#atnobo2019 #AT #atclassof2019 #womenwhohike #getoutside #wildandpreciouslife #adventure #brutalandbeautiful

Kinda uneventful morning, but still making little climbs/decents and gradually gaining elevation. Made my way to Double Spring Shelter which was 4 miles before Clingmans Dome. A couple hiking down the AT past me as i was heading in to the shelter. I said my usual greetings and they asked if i was through hiking. I said sure am, on day 24. They were like ah cool, you want some pound cake? He whips out this huge slice of chocolate chip pound cake. I just starred at it like it was the holy grail of pound cakes. He put it in my hand and i just said, you guys are so awesome, I can‚Äôt thank you enough and they proceeded on there way. This trail is so amazing, the generosity out here just leaves me speechless. Random strangers are willing to bend over backwards just to brighten your day a little. Its just so cool to know that there are great human beings out there. Im not just talking about the piece of cake but I‚Äôm constantly running into people willing to brighten your day. ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è love it. <br>Had lunch at the shelter and made the climb up to Clingmans. It was a burner, allot if steep section and being at such a high elevation, that sun is no joke. Made it up to Clingmans Dome, the highest point on the Appalachian Trail (6658elv). That was also the 200 mile marker! Woohoo! Just knocking em down. üò¨ allot of people there checking out the view. When you‚Äôve spent so much time on trail, it feels really weird around that many people. ü§£ since we climbed all day, guess what? The rest of the day was all down hill. It got pretty hard on the knees for a while but it‚Äôs all part of the journey. Got into Mt Colins Shelter about 5:30, it was 0.5 miles of the AT, what kinda crap is that. ü§£ There‚Äôs a ridge runner here making sure everyone is in the shelter. üò¢ beautiful shelter though, in a pine tree forest. üå≥ thanks for all the love and support. üèïüö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚õ∞ Hike on...<br>#2019appalachiantrailthruhike #appalachiantrail #atthruhike #atnobo2019 #georgiatomaine #at2019 #traillife #backpacking #adventureawaits #explore #exploremore #optoutdoors #thruhik

Had a cup of coffee and an RX bar for breakfast. Left Mollies Ridge Shelter about 8:30am with a goal to hike 17 miles. Started the day off with a good climb up Devils Tater Patch(4775 elv) then made the argues decent into Big Abrams Gap (4115 elv). Had lunch at Russell Field Shelter (M 180.8) and meet allot of section hikers out for the week. It was a pretty technical climb up to Thunderhead Mountain, (5527 elv) but the view was epic. From the top you could see Fontana Dam, NC, Knoxville, TN and Gatlinburg, TN. Sat up there on the bald and had a little snack. Meet a fellow CrossFitter up there, that had been doing it fir about three years, so you know we talked about that for awhile. üòÇ had allot of pretty technical downhill and sharp technical up hill. A few times i had to just toss my trekking poles up the trail so i could use both hands and boulder my way up. On paper the route looked easy, i reality it wasn‚Äôt.

Wooo!! ü•≥ The two zero days in Fontana Dam were great. A VW car show was going on that weekend, so it was good to go around the resort and check out all the activities. Even though we mostly ate all weekend. Get up at 8, hey you hungry? Yup, wanna grab breakfast? Yup. Noon oclock, hey you hungry? Yup, wanna grab lunch? Yup. 3pm, hey you hungry? Yup, wanna grab dinner? Yup. 7pm, hey you hungry? Yup, wanna grab dinner again? Yup. WE ATE SO MUCH FOOD!! It was awesome üò¨. Got back on trail about 10am and crossed Fontana Dam, Headed straight up in the smokeys to 4500ft. Throughout our time here we will mainly be staying at 4500 to 6000ft of elevation. Lots if up and downs but nothing to strenuous, hopefully üòë Calves were definitely sore today since taking 2 zeros, but everything else was doing good. Still got that knot in my upper back but has gotten better. Rolled into Mollies Gap Shelter about 5:30pm and set up camp. Throughout the smokeys it is required that you stay in the shelters unless it is full. It‚Äôs a nice shelter. Has a lower row that fits about 6-7 and an upper section that fits about the same. It was full, so i set up my tent üòÅ I‚Äôm not complaining! Made dinner and chilled with the shelter crew for a bit. Seven also made it after abandoning me earlier in the day. ü§£ supposed to be down to 34 tonight, so had to pull all my cold weather gear out again. Has to be about a week since I‚Äôve had to do that, been rather warm at night. 11.8 mile day in total and will have a 12.1 mile day tomorrow. Excited to see what the smokeys have in store.

It was a great way to bounce back to good spirits after hiking in driving rain for the better part of 5 hours and soaking ourselves through.

Many of our days are spent looking at exactly this for hours: dead/dormant trees, dry brown leaves, twigs and felled branches, and scarce appearances of green. That doesn't get shown often because it isn't very "insta-worthy." But it is the most accurate depiction of how we spend a lot of our time. Sometimes the only reason we hike is because we need to cover some ground between sleep. Those are the days we put some music in our earbuds, drink caffeine, and find a way to get through it. Thru-hiking isn't always scenic or adventurous or wonderful. It's a hard mental game sometimes when you don't want to walk, but you just gotta.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #appalachianthruhike #atclassof2019 #atnobo #atnobo2019 #thruhike #optoutside #hikerhunger #hikertrash #appalachiantrail2019 #embracethesuck #hikerfeed

I took my time packing things up, the body was still pretty sore. Sat on a log and drank my coffee as everyone headed out. The first 2 miles started out with a good climb up to Cheoah Bald (5062ft)ü•µ. Got a few pretty good pictures of the view. Then it was down hill for the next 2 miles. Ran into a guy I‚Äôve been leapfrogging with since the start and said there was trail magic at the next gap, woohoo. Had a little bit if a climb and then it was downhill into Stecoah Gap where hwy 143 ran through and trail magic was still there. Dropped my pack and talked with the folks putting it on for a bit. Mist were previous thru hikers wanting to give back. After about 4 hot dogs, 2 cokes and some fresh made banana bread i headed out. The climb out of Stecoah was killer. In less than a mile we climbed almost 1000ft. My legs were still pretty tired from the day before. It did drag on like before but it was STEEP AF! By the time I‚Äôd got to the top i had burned right threw the 4 hotdogs, 2 cokes and the banana bread was about to come upü§ÆüòÇ. It was a short but intense ascent, but we got it done. After that i was a little bit of a roller coaster until hitting Cody Gap Camp. Tent is set up and food in the belly.

It was pretty quite, just had two other thru hikers stating nearby. Did the normal mirning routine and was packed up and back on trail by 9am. It was super cloudy and foggy most of the morning, so through on a Joe Rogan podcast to help get out of my head. ü§£ made it up to Wayah Bald by 11ish. There was a nice stone tower at the peak to help get a good view of all the mountains. Could see Standing Indian Mountain that i had done last week. It looked enormous from where i was at, couldn‚Äôt even see the summit, the clouds had it. After leaving Wayah Bald the day took a huge turn. Got to Licklog Gap (no I didn‚Äôt make that up) and it started pouring rain. It would come in spurts, just down right pouring rain for 10-15 minutes, let up for a few then just down pour for another 10-15 minutes. This cycle continued for the next 5 miles until i reached Cold Spring Shelter. I got to the shelter, dumped my pack, pulled out my food and munched. The plan was to go another 2 miles to Big Branch campsite, but the rain never let up. Sat there and mingled with two other thru hikers who beat the rain and were planning to spend the night. Waited about 2 hours to see if the weather would change, it didn‚Äôt, so i went 0.1 miles up trail to find a campsite. The rain had stoped just long enough to get the tent up and all my crap inside. I‚Äôve been laying here, in my tent, since 2:30. The rain has not stopped, I‚Äôm bored, a little wet and i gotta poop. ‚òπÔ∏è Hopefully tomorrow is better.

We past by Winding Stair Gap as we drove to Wallace Gap and seen that there was some trail magic setup. Hot dogs, cookies, breakfast burritos, the whole works. I was being dropped of a few miles up trail so would get there in a few hours. Went up and over the hill separating Wallace and Winding Stair and by the time i got to the trail magic they were gone. Dang nabbit!! üò´ was really looking forward to a burrito, oh well. Cruised up hill to Siler Bald Mountain and took the 0.2 mile blue blaze up to the tippy top. Got a 360 degree view of epic! Just mountain after mountain as far as i could see. (pun intended) had a snack and enjoyed the view. Trekked 3 more miles to Wine Spring Road camp and set up camp. For not getting on trail until 11:30 and busting out 12 miles today, it was a good day. Just made some four cheese pasta sides and plan tomorrow‚Äôs activities. I hope everyone has a great night.

That being said I am stoked for her and her big dream. Being the incredible person she is, she wanted to make this journey bigger than herself, so she has partnered with 2 organizations (@hilarityforcharity and @letusmovemountains ) to try and raise money for some great causes. Her hope is to raise $10 for every mile she hikes (2200 miles). No amount is to big or 2 small. Reposts welcome! I will plug her post below for more info about the organizations. You can also head over to the link in her bio or mine to donate. If you happen to run into her on the trail give her a big hug for me. @courtneystrieker you are strong and brave and I can‚Äôt wait to follow along with you on your journey.

Even though i was sleeping on a hump. Stayed the night at Standing Indian Shelter. Beautiful shelter but the tent pads were horrible, not a flat one in site. Where i had placed my tent, it was either left side hump or right side BIG ASS POINTY ROCK IN MY BACK, i went with the hump. ü§£üôÑ went to bed at normal time last night, about 9 o‚Äôclock. There where probably around 9 tents set up around the shelter. The next morning i woke up, same time i have been, about 7ish. I get out of my tent and I‚Äôm the ONLY tent in site. üò± I looked around like ‚ÄúWTF mate‚Äù did i miss the memo?! ü§£üòâ guess i was with a bunch of early risers. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è<br>You better believe i still had my coffee and breakfast before i left. ‚òïÔ∏èüç≥ Started the day out with a 2 mile gradual climb up Standing Indian Mountain. (pictured earlier today) The view up there was awesome. I was the only one up there so, so i sat on the ledge for about 15 minutes and just let it all soak in. üòä made my descent down the mountain into Beech Gap and had a snack and a power nap, I‚Äôm on vacation, i nap when i want too. ü§™ the trail after that was beautiful, we weren‚Äôt up on top of the ridge line like we‚Äôve been for the past 90 miles. We‚Äôve been kinda in the middle, walking past streams and weaving in and out with the mountains. it‚Äôs a nice change of pace, other than going up and right back down. Made it to Betty Creek Gap about 3pm. I had originally planned to camp here but wanted a shorter day for tomorrow. Planning on heading into Franklin, NC friday and by staying here it would have been a 12 mile hike to get into town. So i decided to walk 5 more miles to the next shelter. I went up Albert Mountain with the famous fire station at its peak. That climb WAS. NO. JOKE!! By far toughest climb yet, but worth it. That fire station is also the 100 mile marker for the AT. HELL YEAH!! Two days and two milestones kicked down. üòéü•≥ after the champagne and cake i headed down to Long Branch Shelter, for a 16.3 mile day. üò´üò≠ I‚Äôm done, tired, totally beat. But means i only have a 5 mile hike into town. All right! üòè Thanks for all the love and support. üèïüö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚õ∞

They had a few people out doing some trail maintenance, cutting downed trees, water runoff‚Äôs. After that started making my way up Standing Indian Mountain. The shelter was about half way up and the next camp was still 5 miles up and over the mountain. Currently chillen, waiting on dinner.

Had around 12 thru hikers bunched together on a little site just off trail. Meet two guys from the Netherlands, a group of four from canada, three guys from texas and a couple from New Jersey. <br>Made coffee and breakfast, then hit the trail. Had a nice morning climb up Kelly Knob to get the blood flowing. then a good 1500ft decent into Dicks Creek Gap, which sucked on the knees. Stayed and had lunch in Dicks Creek Gap with a few other thru hikers. The sun had finally decided the show about that time and warmed everything up, so i took a 15 minute power nap on the picnic tables, not the most comfortable but did the trick. After lunch was a long grueling climb up Buzzard Knob, just a steady climb up over the next 1.5 miles. üò© got into camp about 4:30, a little later than normal but i was taking more breaks through out the day. Found a great spot at a unnamed campsite. No service either ü§î you‚Äôll see in the videos how good this site is. üòé thanks for all the love and support.

He has a face that was made to smile, a gentle spirit, and a sweet, silent laugh. Q is attentive to the needs of others and is earnest when he offers to help you or share his food with you. He cheerfully puts others first. He is a peaceful man who can see beauty and positivity even on the hard days. He is sending his grandson a rock from each state along the AT. Sunshine wonders how he picks the perfect rock, but we are sure he does it carefully and with love. Q has a theory about the laws of physics on the AT: what goes up, must go up some more. We hate that he's right, but at least he can joke about it. Q is the kind of person who won't remember the small details of his hike, such as the mileage or the names of the shelters he slept in. What he DOES remember, is who was sleeping at each shelter with him and what conversations he had. We think that means he has an innate focus on the right things in life. Everyone is happy to see Q. Especially Sunshine when he announces he has her lost toilet paper in his pack!<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#hikerspotlight #hikers #appalachiantrail #appalachianthruhike #atclassof2019 #atnobo #atnobo2019 #thruhike #optoutside #hikerhunger #hikertrash #appalachiantrail2019 #hikerfeed

From talking to others, this seems to be a common struggle pairs and couples have on the trail. These days we feel like we are hitting our stride (no pun intended) and have some good compromises established. Habits train the mind, so we essentially tried swapping some roles. Sunshine started setting the alarms and waking Blue up in the mornings. When we decide to stop early for the day due to Sunshine being over it or in pain, she sets a goal for a high mileage day to make up for it. (Apparently it's easier for her to do the hard things when it's her idea.) She is figuring out how to pack up more quickly in the morning. Believe it or not, it was her idea to wake up at 5am today to hike into town before 9am. Bluegrass, on the other hand, has graciously chilled out enough for Sunshine to have her morning coffee everyday. On days where only 10ish miles are planned, we sleep in and he doesn't mind starting at 10:30. He is now in charge of picking the scenic lunch spots. In general, he is sporting a much more laid back and cheerful appreciation of the current moment rather than always thinking about the future. (A big thank you to CBD and mature communication!) We are trying to be better at communicating at the start of the day: is this a leisure day, or a day to kick ass? And we come to an agreement. Basically, we are meeting in the middle and feeling stronger because of it. .<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #appalachianthruhike #atclassof2019 #atnobo #atnobo2019 #thruhike #optoutside #hikerhunger #hikertrash #appalachiantrail2019 #marriage #compromise #hiketogether #staytogether #honestsocialmedia #candid #hikerfeed

This time our update is going to have more in terms of #thegood rather than #thebad or #theugly . <br>The Good: Where to start? We saw Max Patch in sunny clear weather, which is sort of an AT milestone hikers look forward to. Friends and family have surprised us with visits and treated us with so much love. Hot Springs was a lovely town filled with kind and hospitable people and  surprisingly good beer. We have really found our groove in compromising with our different hiking styles (more on that later) and we feel like we are coming together as an even stronger team than before. Trail angels hooked us up with slackpacking, cowboy camping in their truck, and Sunshine's first ever chilli dog. Bluegrass saw his first shooting star. We saw Big Bald Mountain in the snow and wind and it made our running list of top 10 favorite sights along the AT. Also- NO RAIN?! Seriously. We could keep going.<br><br>The bad: What we thought was altitude sickness was apparently not. Bluegrass seems to have some inner ear issue where he gets dizzy when he is lying down at night. Sunshine has plantar fasciitis, athletes foot, and a gnarly cough. And neither of us have slept well in many nights.<br><br>The ugly: Sunshine had a weird moment where she got all emotional and thought Bluegrass wasn't going to like her anymore by the end of the AT. Whatever, it was weird and dumb.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>#appalachiantrail #appalachianthruhike #atclassof2019 #atnobo #atnobo2019 #thruhike #optoutside #hikerhunger #hikertrash #appalachiantrail2019 #hiketogether #staytogether #hikerfeed

Temps got down into the lower 20‚Äôs, I‚Äôm not about that life. ü§£ got a hot shower, laundry done and recharged all my sh!t. Went into town for dinner, went to this awesome Mexican joint and had a mug of beer. The stomach was happy. üòÅ woke up the next morning and some of the guys were making eggs, bacon and biscuits, annihilated that. Packed my gear and caught the 8oclock shuttle back to the AT. First climb up Tray Mountain (pictured) was killer, had to burn off that breakfast. üòí the rest of the day was uneventful, a few climbs here and there but nothing to write about. Had the ear buds in most of the day. Using the inspirational lyrics of Alter Bridge to get me through the day. Got into Addis Gap about 3:30 for a 12 mile day. Legs are sore and still have the knot in my back, working that out as i type this. Foods in the belly and trying to stay warm. Low of 29 tonight. Thanks for the love and support.

Do the bears smell me? Do the skunks smell me? Why don‚Äôt the skunks run away? I fear i have been welcomed by new neighbors.ü§£ü§¢<br>Didn‚Äôt sleep very good last night, every position had my back hurting. I‚Äôm not much of a side sleeper but have noticed i have been the past few nights. Might need to invest in a light weight air bed. <br>Started the day with a nice ascent up Levelland Mountain(200ft) to get the blood pumping. Past a few thru hikers still packing their stuff up. Made it over Cowrock Mountain(pictured) into Tesnatee Gap. There was a small parking lot where day hikers could go up Cowrock and see the views. Took my pack off to put my shorts on, it was warm, mid 70‚Äôs i think. As i was doing that a family pulls up and asks me ‚Äúhow far do these trails go?‚Äù I pointed back in the direction i came and said ‚Äúabout 50 miles that way‚Äù and if you go this way (pointing in the direction i was going) ‚Äúyou can walk all the way to Maine‚Äù. The look of bafflement on their face was hilarious. I had to explain, Maine the state, the one up by canada. ü§£ the next question ‚Äúare there any 2-3 mile hikes around?‚Äù üôÑ i pointed them up Cowrock to see the views. ‚õ∞<br>So I continued up Wildcat Mountain(3637ft) a very steep 600ft climb, short but intense. Made it into Hogpen Gap by 1pm where a local church had set up some trail magic. Ice cold lemonade and 2 chocolate moon pies had my name all over it. üò¨ sat there and mingled for about a half hour then got back on trail. Past by Low Gap Shelter about 2, it was too early to stop. Hiked 2 more miles to Poplar Stamp Gap and set up camp. Set the tent up and sealed the seams with seam sealer i bought back at Neels Gap. Only one other thru hiker with me tonight. Temps are supposed to fall into the 20‚Äôs tomorrow night so will be heading into town. Thanks for the love and support. Have a great Saturday night!

I‚Äôm usually the last one out of camp. But i gotta have my coffee in the morning ü§§. It was a long gradual climb up Blood Mountain. Started to get a knot the day before on my right shoulder blade. Was trying every different stretch to try and ease the burn for a little bit while i was walking. Got to the top of Blood Mountain and the view was epic. Pretty touristy spot and was pretty crowded so didn‚Äôt stay long. Knees held up great on the 1300ft down the backside. Walked into Neels Gap and thought we were getting trail magic, seen canopies set up along the road. It was so much better, Brenau University was raising money for their school and offering thru hikers free back massages. Hell yeah!! Just what i needed. This sweet young girl worked the knots out of my dirty sweaty back for like 15 minutes. Just what i needed üòÅ. Went into Neel Gap Gift Shop and demolished a full sausage & pepperoni pizza and diet coke. Was able to charge a few things while i waited and ate some more. With a full belly and happy soul i headed up to Bull Gap Camp. Chillen with a few thru hikers and headen to bed. Today was a great day. Thanks for all the love and support.

Did the normal morning routine and bid good fortune to the other hikers that are just way more motivated than me in the morning. A couple i camped with had their food bags chewed through by mice.

He noticed a few times, a dark shadow running over his rain fly but couldn‚Äôt hear anything, fast little bastards. ü§£ mostly easy climbing to start out with. Made the ascent up Ramrock Mountain, which had the best few on the AT yet. Made it to Woody Gap and called a shuttle to take me into Suches, GA for a quick resupply. I had enough food for lunch and dinner but was running short on snacks. I wanna throw a shout out to Uber Steve Shuttle Service (scuba steves ugly cousin). I was picked up, driven to town, got snacks and drove back all within 20 minutes. Hell yeah! Took a short siesta and headed back on trail. Made the ascent up Big Cedar Mountain, with another great view. Got into camp about 5ish and literally took the last site. üò§ all in all it was a good day.

It took allot to muster up the motivation to get out of the sleeping bag, but once i was out, things warmed up quick. The day started out rather easy with a few up and downs. kinda like going down some moguls, You go up the mountain and come down the mountain and dry rinse repeat. Once i hit Sassafras Mountain it was show time. Climbed up the gradual 800ft to Sassafras and the 400ft down to Cooper Gap. Took lunch at Cooper Gap(mile 12.2) and talked to few other thru hikers that were doing the same. Climbed up and over Justus Mountain(mile 14.3) and set up camp just passed Justus Creek. It‚Äôs supposed to get down into the lower 30‚Äôs tonight. Chit chatting around the fire with a few fellow thru hikers then it‚Äôs off to bed. Heading into town tomorrow, resupply and exchange some gear. Good night. üòéüö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüèï<br>#2019appalachiantrailthruhike #appalachiantrail #atthruhike #atnobo2019 #georgiatomaine #at2019 #traillife #backpacking #adventureawaits #explore #exploremore #optoutdoors #thruhiker #katahdinorbust #ichallengeyoutoalloutlife

The morning on Springer Mountain started out foggy and dreary, but by mid day, the clouds had cleared and the sun was shining. Ran into allot of day hikers coming down the backside of Springer. I hit Three Forks(mile 4.3) around lunch time, meet a few more people taking there attempt at thru hiking, then sat and had lunch by the river. Pictured here is the sign for the Hickory Flats Cemetery. It was 0.2 miles off trail so I didn‚Äôt go check it out. ü§£ got into Hawk Mountain Campsite around 3. Set up camp and let the tent dry off from the rain that morning. (nothing like rolling up a wet cold tent to start the day off.) üôÑ picked a nice site with a fire pit down the hill from the trail. Got a fire started and not 20 minutes later it started raining (fricken great üò§). After that, i just laid in the mobile home and planned out the adventure for tomorrow. Thanks everybody for all the love and support.

For us this week, the difficulties were with figuring out what it means to "hike your own hike" when you are a married couple hiking together and you both have very different hiking styles. Bluegrass is early to sleep and early to rise. He wants to do big miles and challenge himself. He monitors his pace so he can reach his destination early and fit the most into the day. He is streamlined with his stoveless breakfast and dutiful ability to wake up to the first alarm. He's a "snack while walking" kind of guy who usually has to back-track a few feet when we walks past a good view. He has a plan forming in his head for about 4-5 days into the future on the AT at all times. Sunshine thinks mornings are hard because she was up for hours the night before thinking and writing while the other hikers snored. She wants hot coffee and Carnation breakfast in her sleeping bag before she gets anything done on a cold morning. She stops to take pictures of mushrooms and pinecones and vistas. She wants to take breaks to lay in the sun when she passes the perfect spot. She doesn't get there fast, but she gets there eventually. What does that mean for us and how we hike together? We don't know yet. Sunshine admits she could be more disciplined and thoughtful about the future. Blue admits he could relax a bit and learn to enjoy the little moments. We are working compromises into our daily routines and figuring it out. But it isn't easy!<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #appalachianthruhike #atclassof2019 #atnobo #atnobo2019 #thruhike #optoutside #hikerhunger #hikertrash #appalachiantrail2019

The only re-supply option is in Gatlinburg, which is far away from the trail, expensive, and infested with tourists.  Thru-hikers are also mandated in the Smokys to sleep in shelters unless they are full. But we have to give up our spots to other hikers who made reservations for shelter space. That means you can be sound asleep in a full shelter, and a family of 5 can walk in at 10pm with reservations and rightfully kick you out. Luckily this didn't happen to us, but we didn't enjoy the stress of never knowing where we would sleep. We hiked through the park during spring break with excellent weather, which means it was crowded with section hikers and families on weekend trips. We love meeting people on the trail, but sharing a shelter with these folks is tricky. They want to build a fire and play games and stay up until 11pm and then sleep-in the next day. Whereas the thrus are in their quilts by 7:45pm and up again at 6am. Earplugs (for both parties) can only do so much. Secondly, Bluegrass started to feel some altitude sickness and that royally sucked. Sunshine fell down pretty hard and ripped her favorite pair of leggings. And, our last complaint, THOSE WATER BARS. (Second picture). For the love of God. We would rather hike through mud and streams than hoist our tired bodies up these two-foot steps repeatedly, or ruin our knees by taking hard and heavy steps down them. We tried walking around them. We tried alternating our feet. It doesn't matter. These things hurt. And they are all over the Smokys. .<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #appalachianthruhike #atclassof2019 #atnobo #atnobo2019 #thruhike #optoutside #hikerhunger #hikertrash #appalachiantrail2019 #thegoodthebadtheugly

Thru-hikers love 'em or hate 'em. We will split the middle and just call it a love/hate relationship. As usual, we want to share our candid update by including the good, the bad, and the ugly. But this time, each one will need a post of it's own. So let's start now with the good stuff.<br><br>The Good: We had uncharacteristically great weather every day. Windy and cold, yes. But sunny and clear every darn day, and that's unheard of for the Smokys. The clear skies meant we enjoyed our best views on the AT so far. We summited a mountain during a golden sunset. We passed through our first conifer forest, and it felt like a sanctuary. We stared into endless blue mountains under crystal skies. We walked slowly through frosty wonderlands. We enjoyed aromas of pine and spruce that were intensified by the sun. Truly the most beautiful parts of the trail so far. We don't have the proverbial "trail legs" yet, but the Smoky Mountains will mark the point where we first started to feel like thru-hikers. Where we noticed that we don't need to stop to catch our breath while hiking 2.5 mph up a mountain. Where we started to schedule lunch time around the scenery instead of the time of day or state of our stomachs (we can always eat anyway). Where we decided it was worth the weight to carry a can of Pringles or 8oz tub of mayonnaise. Where we smelled just as bad to the day hikers as they smelled lovely to us. The Smokys were challenging and annoying. But they have changed us, and we aren't mad about it. .<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #appalachianthruhike #atclassof2019 #atnobo #atnobo2019 #thruhike #optoutside #hikerhunger #hikertrash #appalachiantrail2019 #smokymountains #gsmnp #thegood #thebad #theugly

He is a horticulturalist and a hugger. When he walks through a dormant forest, he sees what you and I don't: all the hidden buds and sleeping stems that will soon bloom into something obvious. He knows what they will become and he knows their scientific names. He is warm, easy to know, and easy to love. His willingness to enjoy real conversation, keep eye contact, and go out of his way for others is refreshing to our generation. He believes in taking care of nature, taking side trails, and staying out of the trail towns as much as he can help it. Thanks to grad school, he can enjoy a cup of coffee at 8pm like it's no big deal. He is hiking the AT with his dad Gopher, whose feet are hungry for miles and whose eyes always have a twinkle about them. Gopher has a Georgian accent that feels like a fireplace when you hear it. If he thinks you need it, he might pull out a piece of dove chocolate from no where and throw it your direction. He has a wit and a quiet peace about him that make his presence feel like a hidden treasure. When he opens his mouth, it is either to say something meaningful or to make you smile. We think the world could use more people like these two. The only thing we don't like about them is how hard it is to catch up to them on the trail! No matter how much time passes between seeing them, they are family to us.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #atclassof2019 #atnobo2019 #atthruhike #thruhike #thruhiker #hikertrash #hikerhunger #hikerspotlight #love

Wind gusts in the m<br>Smoky Mountains we're forecasted to be up to 50mph. As our good friend put it, "one day won't make your hike, but it can end it." We desperately did not want to leave the trail, but figured the warning of potential blow-downs was worth heeding. We hiked 5.2 miles downhill to get to Cade's Cove. And yes, as we said, only 0.2 of those miles were on the AT. Tomorrow we will need to hike those 5 miles UP to get back to the trail. BUT: We got to sunbathe in the grass area of a parking lot. We got a free ride into town from a generous day hiker. A fellow hiker bought our room, so we are buying his dinner whether he likes it or not. We showered and brought our dirty clothes in with us to do "hiker laundry" with a bar of soap. We are about to take a trolley around town to get our re-supply. A friend hooked us up with a ride back to the trail tomorrow. AND we've been holding onto a Texas Roadhouse gift card for over a month...and guess what restaurant is walking distance from our motel?! .<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#atclassof2019 #appalachiantrail #thruhiker #thruhike #atnobo #atnobo2019 #thruhiker #hikertrash #hikerhunger #optoutside

Gettin' There likes his trail name to be pronounced as one half-eaten word. It is his usual response when you ask how he is doing while he's hiking: "oh, I'm gettin' there." And surely, he is. Gettin' There doesn't like mornings. But he does like stopping to enjoy simple pleasures, such as chuckling when he arrives at a shelter just before it starts to rain. Or laying in the grass under the sun midday even though there are miles left to tread. He believes in stopping for lunch. He believes in strong coffee. He pays attention to what people say and thinks about it long after it's been said. He is cerebral and a problem solver. He is knowledgeable about the most unexpected things, like archaeology for example. He is caring and kind to others. He has a punchy, cynical wit that will faithfully give you at least one belly-laugh per day. He knows who he likes and who he doesn't.

But for now, with our last bit of wifi, we wanted to share some clips from our recent slackpack between Fontana Dam and Stecoah Gap. The best part of it was the German Shepherd who ran up on Bluegrass (and scared the crap out of him) and then continued to hike with us along the trail for another 6 miles or so. We gave him all of our beef jerky, called the owner, and had him returned home safely. But we really enjoyed his company and made sure to tell him every half mile or so that he was a goodgood boy. We've been learning to see the beauty in the rain and fog... Because it doesn't seem to be going anywhere, does it?<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #atclassof2019 #atnobo2019 #atnobo #thruhiker #thruhike #optoutside #slackpack #noc #nantahalaoutdoorcenter #fontanadam #dancemoves #hikertrash #hiketogetherstaytogether #appalachiantrail2019 #atthruhike

They have been full-time trail angels ever since I Believe summitted Katahdin at the age of 62 in 2014. Jimmy has the mind of a computer and the heart of a servant. We call him Mr.Logistics because of his strength in helping hikers plan their journey one section at a time. Sunshine's favorite thing about him is his genuine smile when he sees a tired hiker emerging from the mountains, successfully finishing their hike for the day. I Believe has a resilient and humble strength about her, which you will only get to know if you get her talking about her AT experience. Ask her questions and ask for her advice. She has nothing to prove, but is a wellspring of wisdom when you get her going. She has a childlike joy about her that will inspire you to hug her regularly. She also makes a mean Mexican casserole. These two have blessed us immeasurably with their stories, rides in their truck, opportunities to slack-pack difficult sections, home-cooked meals, and their belief in our ability to get to Katahdin. Check the link in our bio for Jimmy's YouTube channel where he interviews hikers...

We want to do better at proving that to you, so we are going to do a "hiker spotlight" to introduce you to some of these amazing characters periodically. .<br>.<br>This is Halo. He is named after a pope that no one has heard of. He loves blackberry cobbler and his wife Rhonda. He retired early from Sherwin Williams to hike the AT, and has hiked almost every day with us since day one. He has a strong faith and a warm, safe, accepting spirit. If you catch him singing, it will always be "Last Nite" by The Strokes. He stays positive and friendly and all times. He is self-sacrificing and chivalrous. He is generous with his uplifting words and affirmation toward others. And occasionally he talks about pizza in his sleep. He is also really excited about his new beard, which he puts essential oils in every day to boost his morale while hiking. Except that one time when he realized mice liked the smell of his beard at Woods Hole Shelter... He wasn't so excited then. He journals about his AT experience at trailjournal.com/halo ...

OR we could skip the boring stuff and share about the most surprising and lovely part of this adventure so far: the people. We keep experiencing what "community" is supposed to be. Just people helping people. Today we decided to turn two days worth of hiking into one- with a tough 11 mile push into Dicks Creek to stay two nights at a hotel for much needed rest. But we weren't sure how we were going to travel 11 miles up the road from Dicks Creek Gap to Hiawasee. They say out here that "the trail provides," and you just can't know how true that is until you get here. We met some hikers today who were planning on meeting their parents at Dicks Creek for a ride to Hiawasee, and they offered their truck bed to us. Not only that, but when we finally arrived to the parking lot, they asked "do you want a cold beer?!" Now after a long day that started at 5am, formalities were out the window, and we answered honestly: YES! So there we found ourselves, sipping a beer in the sun in the back of someone's truck we didn't know this morning. This is the trail, y'all. (Oh and they insisted on buying us tacos... Which almost made sunshine cry.) #appalachiantrail #tacos #hikerhunger #hikertrash #atnobo2019 #thruhike #thruhiker #atclassof2019 #optoutside

He hope soon to actually get a good view on top of these mountains we are laboriously climbing. The rain does drive down on one's morale, but we are staying positive and keeping at it. Still no zero days, and still no falls/injuries! However, we have made a few of the iconic rookie mistakes (losing gear, packing too much food.)

I am writing this from a cabin lodge at Neels Gap, where historically a large number of attempting thru-hikers are known to quit and head home. We are happy to say that we are not those people.  We are sore. We are tired. And the first two days were especially tough, not just physically but mentally as well. But we have grown stronger in both areas, with more growth to come. The weather was pretty unrelenting with constant heavy rains turning the trail into little streams and waterfalls. There is no "staying dry" out here. But man, this trail will teach you how to stay positive, "embrace the suck," and press on. Possibly the best part of this experience so far has been the people. Our tramily- Halo, Gopher, Peach, Legs, Tex, Webster, and Rebel are the kindest and most interesting people. They've named us Sunshine and Bluegrass...

I had just said goodbye to a couple of dear friends, the last thing I said being, ‚ÄúGod takes care of His children,‚Äù which is some wisdom I have been practicing for a couple of years now. I didn‚Äôt mean this in a strictly Christian sense, but more whether you have love in your heart, and act unselfishly. More spiritual than religious. When I went to start the car and leave, I had the stereo on The Joint to enjoy some reggae. Just listen to the chorus of this song that starts again at about the 1:10 mark. It goes, ‚ÄúGooooood bless the children!,‚Äù and repeats. Now I also just realized as I type this that we are at AT northbound mile 110, 110 miles from the beginning of the Appalachian Trail at Springer Mountain. All I can say is, ‚ÄúWow...‚Äù Praise Jah!!!<br>#zenintheforest #at110 #atnobo2019 #atnobomile110 #goodergrovehostel #goodergrove #outsidefranklinnc

Starting at Springer Mountain, Georgia and ending at Mt. Katahdin, Maine, the trail travels through 14 different states and at nearly 2,200 miles long is the longest ‚Äúhiking only‚Äù foot path. The AT is one of three long trails in the U.S. that include the Pacific Crest Trail (CDT) on the west coast and the Continental Divide Trail (CDT) in the American Heartland. All three are known as The Triple Crown. üëë‚Å£<br>‚Å£<br>I will be posting daily updates and will be releasing videos approximately every 3-4 days (depending on cell signal) while on trail. You can follow me on instagram at ‚ÄúScott.The.Bald‚Äù and head over to my YouTube channel to receive quicker updates. ‚Å£<br>‚Å£<br>Most of the people around me already knew i had been planning this. Feels like I‚Äôve been talking about it for almost 5 years (probably cause i haveü§£). ‚Å£<br>‚Å£<br>Again, SUPER excited to get this news out to everyone and SUPER excited to get out on trail and start the next EPIC adventure. Just putting the final touches on some things and will be ready to go come March. See you on the trail. üòÄüí™‚Å£<br>‚Å£<br>‚ÄúThe world is big and I want to have a good look at it before it gets dark.‚Äù‚Å£<br>John Muir‚Å£<br>‚Å£<br><br>#2019appalachiantrailthruhike #appalachiantrail #atthruhike #atnobo2019 #georgiatomaine #at2019 #traillife #backpacking #adventureawaits #explore #exploremore #optoutdoors #thruhiker #katahdinorbust #ichallengeyoutoalloutlife

For the most part, social media and I don‚Äôt mix very well at all. Mostly because I fall for it every time: the after photos, the summit photos, the ‚Äòlook how amazing and beautiful and full my life is!‚Äô photos. Meaning: I forget that everyone‚Äôs life is hard. Most people don‚Äôt post the hard stuff is all.<br>::<br>Anyway. Part of my journey to the AT is maybe a little different than most. This trip has been four years in the making. And I still have about four and a half months to go.<br>::<br>My apartment lease came up and to save money, I decided to take my sweet man friend up on his offer to temporarily house me and some of my things. But most of my things are going in storage. And I‚Äôm doing this all by myself: the planning, the packing, the scheming, the budgeting.<br>::<br>This is HARD. This is emotionally so fucking hard for me. My family doesn‚Äôt understand my decision, and therefore isn‚Äôt particularly supportive (I know, I know...they‚Äôre just scared for my safety). Believe me when I tell you I am also afraid some days. I‚Äôm afraid of being single and almost 30. I‚Äôm afraid of the fact that I took a demotion at work and I have no permanent home and I have only the next 12 months of my life mapped out. This is so damn scary.<br>::<br>Guys. This is what it looks like to participate relentlessly in the manifestation of your own blessings. This is what it looks like to decide what to be and go be it. This is step 847 of a very long, meticulously studied plan. And this is what it looks like to chase dreams.<br>::<br>We can do hard things. It‚Äôll all be worth it. üåøüçÉ<br>::<br>#atnobo2019
