And I remember sitting in the beach chairs in Logan Airport‚Äôs Terminal C, looking out on the runways, about to fly down to Atlanta to start the hike, and KNOWING that this was a big moment.

My heart aches to go back, to do it again, to retrace my memories and to make new ones. I want to sleep directly under the stars and meet more people who follow their big dreams. I want to eat more stacks of pancakes before leaving towns and feel my heart pump as I spot the sign on the top of Katahdin. I‚Äôve almost forgotten how amazing a shower feels after hiking for days. I want to walk this trail over and over. I get asked whether I am forgetting the bad, that it couldn‚Äôt be this fantastic. Not all adventures are pony rides in May sunshine, said J.R. Tolkien in the Hobbit. But even when I busted my wrist or my knee wanted to give out, I didn‚Äôt want to be anywhere else. I lived an adventure every day. I never knew what view I would find at the top of the next mountain, who I would meet and what would happen. I appreciated living, and was present for it. I itch for that kind of magic. I aim to continue living a life so full. <br><br>#appalachiantrailthruhike #appalachiantrailclassof2020 #atnobo2020 #atsobo2020 #womenwhohike"

My last day at my job is 4/8/21 and I‚Äôll be working odd jobs until my AT hike so that I‚Äôll have time to travel and get some hiking knowledge under my belt.

Midway through the afternoon, I climbed a ladder (I think... or scrambled up a rock..?) and then there was the NH/ME border sign! Almost immediately, Maine showed its true colors with a tough but beautiful climb up to the Goose Eyes. I remember standing on stop of those peaks for a long time, taking in the view around me and wishing I could stay there forever. I specifically remembering giving myself a sore neck that night because I was absolutely enamored but the perfect patchwork quilt of clouds in the sky.

It was just @brivanv and I hiking together at this point, and it had been raining steadily for the past two days. This section of trail is notable because of the 300 stone steps down to the waterfall, the waterfall itself, and the tiny rock ledge that the trail follows alongside the river. When we were there, the river was so swollen, it was just below the lip of the rock ledge - any higher and we would have needed to take the blue blaze alternate up on the ridge.

The whole group was broken up - Rudy and Monk in front, me and old friend from @stationat19e Cliff Walker in the middle, and Billy in the back. I was up on a ridge, about 2 miles from our intended campsite, when all of the sudden, the whole sky turned a deep yellow and we could hear a sound like a freight train coming at us from a distance. A couple moments later, the wind was upon us and trees were being blown over across the trail, branches were being ripped off their trunks and whipped at us, and Cliff and I essentially just stood with our backs to each other and watched opposite directions for falling trees. It was so loud, we were yelling at each other to be heard despite being literally back to back. The storm didn‚Äôt take too long to pass over us, and it seems like as soon as the wind stopped, both of our phones‚Äô emergency alerts sounded with National Weather Service ‚Äútake shelter‚Äù alerts üòÇ When we caught up to Rudy and Monk at the campsite, we found that it was utterly destroyed by downed trees, with many cutting directly across established campsites - had someone stayed in their tent during the storm, they almost certainly would have been crushed. It turns out that a tornado had touched down a few miles north, over the border into SW Massachusetts. None of us felt safe sleeping in the woods that night with all the hang-fire still caught up above us, so we pushed on a few more miles into town to sleep in the backyard of Toymaker‚Äôs Cafe.

Leaving Marion, VA I was with Wild, Fixin, and Silky when we came across an injured hiker on the trail. Wild and Silky helped the hiker and carried their pack the 6 miles round trip back to a road. When they got back, we decided to cut our day short and stop at the Lindamood School House on the Settlers Museum. Forward (Amanda) met us there with cupcakes, PBR, and snack trail magic! My birthday was the day before, so she had great timing! Later that day, the Reverend and his mother came by with a resupply box for @wildonthetrail AND a Dominos pizza for us! That night, we tried to cowboy camp on the schoolhouse porch, but were forced inside by rain around 11. It was still pretty cool to sleep around all the desks and the old wood stove. Oh, AND the schoolhouse held a big plastic bin filled with candy, stocked by local trail angels. A wonderful, trail magic-filled day! #atnobo2020 #atclassof2020 #thruhiker #appalachiantrail"

More snow accumulated over night and once we got higher in elevation it was very noticeable. The snow drifts made walking extremely difficult. We were supposed to go up and over the Grayson Highlands but we were so slow going with all the snow we were unable to make it to where we wanted to be. We bailed out and got off before we could make it there. We felt like we needed to prioritize our safety over getting to see the ponies and the views. We have decided to skip that area until next spring when the snow is gone and we know the ponies will be out and about. We also wanted to do trail magic next year at some point so we plan to just do it all at one time next year!

It was a surprisingly easy day! The day began in a rhododendron tunnel for several miles before climbing up and walking a ridge area for most of the day. The climb down from angel‚Äôs rest overlook was pretty steep but manageable. We did 26 miles in about 9 hours which made me feel great! Knees were pretty sore when we got back to the hostel so I pretty much laid in bed the rest of the evening. The weather wasn‚Äôt supposed to be the greatest this day so we had decided to slack this section but we got surprised with a beautiful day! Very thankful for the break in crappy weather to let us knock out the big miles and put us ahead of schedule! It helped for sure because the weather for the next week is not looking so good.. Fingers crossed it changes because right now we are facing rain and snow on/off for the next 7-10 days. 140 miles left and we plan to push big miles on the days that are clear and figure out what to do on the bad days. Might be some more slack packing unfortunately on those days to just get some miles in but not be completely miserable. I‚Äôm all about hike your own hike so if you don‚Äôt like what we‚Äôre doing/planning, then unfollow me. This year has not been a typical thru-hike.

We slack packed again and went from Apple Orchard Mt to the James River. Starting at 4200 ft in elevation at 7:30 was a bit cold! We were in all our cold weather gear but our hands were still frozen so we put our poles in our bag and hiked with our hands in our pockets for a majority of the morning! Luckily we were going downhill most of the day. A few climbs here and there helped keep us warm. We found a spot that was blocked by the wind and in the sun so we stopped for lunch in the middle of the trail. Sometimes you just gotta do what you gotta do. We saw so much ice coming out of the ground or on the side of rocks. It is definitely turning into winter out here!

The day prior, my friends and I had climbed and descended Blood Mountain in a blowing rainstorm. I was in so much pain from my right knee that the descent took me the better part of 2 and a half hours. Cold, wet, and almost in tears from the pain, I was fucking elated to make it down Blood Mtn and get to Neel Gap - a major milestone (30 miles into the trail). The group of 7(ish?) of us decided to split two cabins at Blood Mountain Cabins to dry off and warm up.  The next day, the weather had not improved much, and as you can see from the photo, I got wet again. But I remember wanting to take this photo of myself because in that moment I felt like I was truly on trail, that this was really happening, and that I was happy to be there. I wish I could go back now and tell Day 4 of 160 Zach (I didn‚Äôt have a trail name yet) that he won‚Äôt believe what is about to happen on trail and what those experiences will do to change him. To keep that smile on, even though there are some truly challenging days ahead. My two month anniversary of touching the sign on Katahdin is tomorrow... and the last month of readjusting has been tough... tougher than the first month. I long to be back in Day 4 Zach‚Äôs shoes - even if they are soaked and muddy. #appalachiantrail #atnobo2020 #atclassof2020 #neelgap #thruhike #thruhiker"

I‚Äôm so happy we‚Äôve made it this far! Before we left West Virginia, we stopped by the ATC HQ and took our pictures. SUCKS we couldn‚Äôt get our Polaroid for the 2020 book (damn ATC) but oh well. We took our own photos and that‚Äôs good enough. We saw lots of stick bugs today and started the Virginia Roller Coaster section (14 miles of steep climbs and descents). We stopped about 5 miles in at a hostel that was allowing camping but turns out the first group there is able to stay in the hostel! So we did that and got a sweet deal of a bed, pizza, ice cream, soda and laundry! It was so worth it as it dropped into the 30‚Äôs that night! I also got the best night sleep I‚Äôve had in a while. I probably slept 12 hours. I must have really needed it! Day 1 of Virginia was not so bad after all. <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #AT2020 #ATnobo2020 #ATFlipFlop2020 #ATsobo2020 #appalachiantrail2020 #appalachianlife #ATclassof2020 #StillOnTheAT #trektheat #thetrek #withguthook #hikemoreworryless #optoutside #wekeepyououtdoors #hikertrash #thruhike #hikerlife #getlost #backpacking #hikerlife #outdoorlife #hiking #adventure #wanderlust"

I‚Äôm trying to be extra careful since I can‚Äôt seem to stay warm&dry in the rain while it‚Äôs cold out. So if I have to hide in a shelter and miss miles because of it; so be it. It gave me a chance to browse through the shelter logbook which I try and do at every shelter if I have time (but I always make sure to sign them). Once the rain let up, we powered through the rest of the day and made it to a shelter right at sunset which is now around 5pm. It was extremely windy so I was afraid of setting my tent up and it crashing on me so I stayed in the shelter. I rigged my rain fly to help block the wind and it was instantly warmer in the shelter.

I discovered I couldn‚Äôt bend my leg - attempting to do so hurt quite a lot - and my knee was somewhat swollen. <br><br>The situation was worrisome bc I couldn‚Äôt remember injuring my leg during the previous day. The pain was, however, centered around the area where I had tweaked my quad coming down from Mt. Washington (DAY 189). <br><br>But bc I hadn‚Äôt bonked it, I was worried I might have a blood clot, a very dire possibility. And as luck would have it, I was alone at the shelter area, and also without a phone signal. I was completely on my own. <br><br>So it was a very long night. I could t sleep, so I watched 3 videos I had downloaded to my phone. <br><br>I determined that the best course of action in the morning would be to hike 3.7 miles back to Route 17 and flag a motorist to take me to get medical care. If, that is, I could stand up. <br><br>When morning came I found my leg was no better, and no worse, and that I could stand and shoulder my pack. I began hiking back to 17, very slowly. <br><br>Luckily, after only about a half a mile, I met another hiker, a retired man not too much older than me. I explained I might have a serious condition and he instantly agreed to hike with me and then take me to the nearest medical facility. <br><br>I was so relieved to have met another human being so quickly. It turns out my new companion had thru-hiked the AT in 2014. His trail name was Raven. We swapped stories about the many points of interest along the 1963 miles I had covered; Raven talked about the injuries he had experienced. Everyone on the trail has had many bumps and bruises. <br><br>Raven took me to the ER at Franklin Memorial Hospital in Farmington, 45 minutes away. An ultrasound ruled out the worst - no clots in my leg. The diagnosis was a torn muscle with some internal bleeding. I would need time to heal. The completion of my thru hike was very much in doubt. <br><br>My son drove up from Portland to meet me. It was so good to see him after my lonely night in the woods. #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atclassof2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #maine"

I went up over Bemis Mountain in the morning, which was beautiful and covered with thick lush stands of young pines. As I walked along I could see Rangeley Lake to the north, surrounded by ever more colorful foliage. <br><br>By mid afternoon I crossed Maine Route 17 and headed toward Sabbath Day Pond, my destination for the day. I guessed it must be a popular spot, bc though I hadn‚Äôt seen anyone today up to that point, I now passed 7 day hikers heading back from the pond. <br><br>I made it to the Sabbath Day Pond Shelter by late afternoon and had my dinner.

I crossed East B Hill Rd., passed by Surplus Pond and crested Wyman Mountain. <br><br>I had a lunch break at the Hall Mountain lean-to, then on the descent I passed SOBO thruer Snapshot, so named bc he was a photographer. He told me what I could expect up the Trail, and said I should tell a man named Poet, at Shaw‚Äôs hostel in Monson, that he had saved his life. This was bc Poet had advised him to switch from a fold up z-rest ground pad to a thermarest air mattress. The air mattresses have just enough insulating R-value to keep you warm. With the cold nights we‚Äôd had the last two days, Snapshot said he wouldn‚Äôt have survived on the z-rest. I thought this was a bit of an exaggeration, but I knew he was definitely better off on the air mattress. I promised to pass along his thanks to Poet. <br><br>I hiked steeply up, and then down, Moody Mountain, and then began a long climb up Old Blue Mountain. I finally made it up in the dusky late afternoon, and a brisk breeze was blowing through the thick and scrubby pines. <br><br>About a mile and a half down the other side of Old Blue I came to a trickle of a stream. My guide and other hikers had said a better water source, and stealth campsites, were another mile down the trail, but it was starting to get dark so I needed to make camp sooner. I watered up and then found a perfect campsite right next to the Trail just a tenth of a mile further. I pitched my tent and made dinner as the first stars shone through the evening sky. #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atclassof2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020 #backpackerlife #backpacker #maine"

You swing around rocks, climb up and down them, and in a couple of places you squeeze through them, tunneling your way along. It takes a couple hours to get through this stretch; it‚Äôs a lot of fun rock scrambling. Luckily, the rocks were dry and not slippery. <br><br>After making it through, I had lunch by a stream, and once rejuvenated I climbed the very steep Mahoosuc Arm. Then, over to Old Speck, the third highest peak in Maine. On the way up, a bald rock face offered spectacular views to the west, including the Presidentials, which were now receding in the distance.

On September 22nd, Day 199 of my NOBO journey, my AT thru hike came to an end just 230 miles short of my goal. <br><br>I was camped at Sabbath Day Pond (mile 1963) when I awoke in the middle of the night not being able to bend my left knee. Long story short, after two precautionary trips to the ER  over the following week my doctors have determined there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôll be able to recover in time to complete my hike this year.  I have a torn muscle in my left leg that has led to a massive hematoma in my thigh; after a week and a half of rest I am still unable to bend my leg. <br><br>Naturally having to stop after hiking 90% of the Trail is very frustrating. It‚Äôs like building 9/10ths of a bridge and then quitting while looking down at the opposite shore. <br><br>On the other hand, I think I‚Äôve learned all of the life lessons the Trail imparts to any other thru hiker. Among those lessons:<br><br>* It doesn‚Äôt matter how you feel about the mountain. It‚Äôs there, so you can either hike over it, or go home. <br><br>* People are basically good. Pay their kindness forward.<br><br>* The Trail will provide.<br><br>I will only miss out on the exhilaration of climbing Mt. Katahdin. But I live in Maine, and I‚Äôve summitted Katahdin before, and walked the ridges of the Bigelows as well, so except for the Hundred Mile Wilderness I‚Äôve hiked nearly all of the Trail.  In time, I hope to return and finish what I started. <br><br>I thank my fellow hikers for their good company and spirit, and for the many others who supported us along the way in this incredibly challenging yet fascinating year. You will not be forgotten!  May our paths cross again soon!<br><br>#at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atclassof2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020 #backpackerlife #backpacker #maine"

He had hung his food bag on a branch right over the bridge. <br><br>We walked up the very steep stretch of trail - 2500‚Äô of elevation gain over 2.5 miles - to the Liberty Springs Campsite. On the way I learned my new friend had hiked the AT in 2019, and had suffered an ACL *and* MCL year while hiking Mt. Moosilauke. He also had a bad back and shoulder. <br><br>‚ÄúI‚Äôve learned to deal with pain,‚Äù he said. <br><br>No doubt. <br><br>Before too much longer I was on Little Haystack Mountain and above the tree line. The panoramic view was spectacular! It was a picture perfect late summer day, and I could see Mt. Lincoln, my next challenge, so close I could touch it. And faintly, off in the distance, the Presidentials. <br><br>Mt. Lincoln concealed the even taller Mt. Lafayette beyond it. I got to top of the latter not long after midday. I had my lunch, then observed a couple exchanging vows right then and there!  They picked a beautiful day for it. <br><br>Then it was a very long, slow, steep climb down Lafayette, then up Mt. Garfield, then halfway down the other side, to the Garfield Ridge Campsite. I had drunk all my water and was completely parched. I was relieved when I got to the campsite. I filtered water from the steam and immediately guzzled 3 liters before filling my water bottles. <br><br>All the tent platforms were occupied by the time I arrived, and a couple who had pitched on one of the ‚Äúlarge group‚Äù tent platforms kindly agreed to share. #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atclassof2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020 #whitemountains #backpackerlife #backpacker #newhampshire"

Today I slackpacked north. At 16 miles it would be my longest day since getting back on the trail. Because of that, I thought about taking my headlamp, but decided against it, thinking it couldn‚Äôt take 12 hours to do it. Turns out I was wrong. <br><br>The hike up South Kinsman Mountain was one of the longest, steepest, and rockiest of my entire hike. Near the top, the mountain ate my trekking pole. I got to the peak and had lunch, wondering how I would manage w just one pole. Just then, two other lady hikers went by - each using one pole!<br><br>I texted Marleen and asked her to pick up a couple of poles and bring them to me along w my pack at the end of the day. I‚Äôd reimburse her, of course.<br><br>The day got later and later. Around dusk, I came by the Lonesome Lake Hut, the first AMC hut I‚Äôd passed. It was closed for the season, but its water spigot was still working, so I tanked up on potable water. <br><br>I continued down in the twilight. I hoped to let my eyes adjust and walk in the dark. I could use my phone, but it only had 20% power left, so I didn‚Äôt want to use it. I texted Marleen and let her know I‚Äôd be getting to the trailhead later than expected, and after dark. <br><br>My phone power dwindled to 1%. I had no phone signal and so I couldn‚Äôt tell Marleen exactly where I was. <br><br>Suddenly in front of me I saw...a headlamp! Miraculously, another hiker was starting out on the Trail! <br><br>The Trail Will Provide. <br><br>He introduced himself as Lemonade. He was middle-aged, but stocky and strong. He kindly walked me the half mile back to the trailhead, where a very worried Marleen was waiting. <br><br>I thanked Lemonade profusely. <br><br>‚ÄúMaybe I‚Äôll see you on the Trail tomorrow,‚Äù he said, and headed back into the darkness. <br><br>My plan was to pitch my tent near the trailhead, but Marleen convinced me that one more night at the Notch Hostel would be a better idea.

That day I chose to count the little orange creatures called Newts, and I saw 21 of them over the course of the day. It was the most I had ever seen! We got to camp late so we cooked and immediately went to bed. Luckily on the 8th we had a shorter day of 12 miles. We woke up and went and talked with the local trail angel Tom and learned a few things about the town. We continued on and got some good views throughout the day. My feet started to hurt early so I was thankful for the short day. We made it to Father Tom Campsite, where we met one of the local caretakers and she told us the history of the campsite.

I had a decision to make yesterday after waiting at the post office half the day. Should I forward my box when it comes in to Lincoln, NH or should I stay and take a zero (after my very short day yesterday) in Hanover? My cold weather gear is not here but I checked the weather and for the next 3 days it looks ok. I decided to get back on trail and have the post office forward my stuff to Lincoln? The big question I have for people that know the area is if my box doesn‚Äôt arrive in Lincoln on Monday do I forward it to Maine and pick it up when I finish and go without cold weather gear (chance it that I won‚Äôt need it) or wait in Lincoln before the major climbs happen??

First, the heat was difficult and mixed with the humidity made it torturous. Second, as you see I had a shoe blow out on my right shoe. My toes were in the dirt after coming off the hillside where the flow out was and I cut the inside of my right ankle on a rock when it happened. Duck tape did help to get me to town. Third, the freaking bugs! There are all type of bugs that get on my nerves on this trail but those small gnats that buzz in your ears and go dive bomber style right in your eyes really piss me off. I started wearing my phone on my head to deter them with noise, it semi worked but made it more hot to deal with and no water logging my head to cool me down. Needless to say after 10.54 after a very nice trail angel fed me at a parking lot by a lake and then a very long 18.41 miles I made it just outside of Lee Massachusetts and going to try and get some new shoes and stay out of the rain that is suppose to happen in the morning. I might take a full day off but have not decided- I think I deserve it after yesterday. I did sleep right next to a beautiful lake and swam before bed which lightened my mood a little. #jessallthingsrunning #appalachiantrail2020 #appalachiantrail #thruhike #hikelikeagirl #atclassof2020 #appalachiantrailclassof2020 #allwomenalltrails #womenthathike #athikethru #nobo #atnobo2020 #whiteblaze #georgiatomaine #backpacking #optoutside #withguthook #hike #hiking #camping #trekking #trailrunning #outdooradventure #outdoors #naturelover #mountain #mountains #throughhike"

I better get off the Trail and get some serious rest w my friends George + Siobhan. <br><br>The man, who was about my age, said his name was Marc, and he and his 2 sons were headed back to their car, parked at the nearest trailhead 2.1 miles back. He very graciously offered to drive me all the way back to G+S‚Äôs place. I slogged out of the woods like a sloth. <br><br>On the drive, Marc , who was from Alabama, explained that their vacation in Vermont was ‚Äúplan 4.3‚Äù, due to COVID.  Originally, he said they planned to hike in New Mexico. Then the virus came along and put the kabosh on that. He then looked at booking a trip to the Wonderland Trail around Mt. Ranier, but it was too late to book a registration. He decided to plan a trip to the Adirondacks, and booked a flight to Albany. Just before they were to leave, a 14-day quarantine was declared for people coming to NY, so a trip pond-hopping in the Green Mountains was their fallback. <br><br>Siobhan took me to the local clinic where I got some unfortunate - but not unexpected - news. I had a stress fracture in my foot. The recommended treatment? 3-8 weeks of rest.

Breakfast and a pleasant hike along the pond. Cool morning air. A spectacular view from the top of rocky Baker Peak. Gradually though, my sore right foot began to throb, and my pace slowed to well under 2 mph. <br><br>After hiking for 3 1/2 hours, I came to Big Branch, a good sized flowing stream only 5.8 miles from my point of origin. I decided to cross the large suspension bridge and take a break in the opposite bank. As I did so, I felt a prick in my left leg. ‚ÄúStupid mosquito!‚Äù I thought. I went to swat away the pest, but when I looked down I saw a yellow jacket hanging off my leg by its stinger!  It didn‚Äôt hurt too badly, but it‚Äôs funny how much more it hurt when I suddenly knew it wasn‚Äôt a mosquito. <br><br>I fetched water in Big Branch, took my shoes off, and soaked my aching foot in the cold flow. I had an early lunch and my leg felt much better. <br><br>But it didn‚Äôt last long. The soreness returned as soon as I hit the trail again. I decided the best thing to do would be to cut today‚Äôs hike short and rest up at Little Rock Pond. I could soak my leg in the pond and maybe go for a swim. <br><br>It was a slow slog to the pond but I finally made it. Since it was early in the day (1:30pm) I was able to get a choice tent platform.

Mid-morning George drove me to the outfitter in Manchester. On the way we noticed a hiker with his thumb out for a hitch and we picked him up. His name was Spring Break, and he had been hiking the AT over the last few years a section at a time. He said he was a teacher and took to the Trail for a month every summer. <br><br>George got me back to the Trail.  I thanked him for his hospitality and we said our goodbyes. I was looking forward to seeing him and Siobhan next week when I took a break at Beth‚Äôs family‚Äôs lake house in Maine. <br><br>I hit the Trail and hiked up Bromley Mountain, making reasonably good time. Towards the top, however, my right foot, which had been a little sore for a couple of days, began to throb. <br><br>Bromley has ski slopes, and I decided to take a break on the chair lift on the summit. I was soon joined by Casper, a SOBO thru hiker. Curious about the situation in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, I asked him about his experience. He said the AMC huts were closed but you could still get water there, and food, for a modest price. He said there were three main ‚Äúups‚Äù: Mt. Moosilauke, the ‚ÄúPressies‚Äù (Presidentials), and Wildcat Mountain. I felt a little better about the traverse, which could be the most challenging of my hike. <br><br>With my sore foot, I was glad I only had to hike 10 miles today. By 6pm<br>I got to beautiful Griffith Pond and got a great tent platform site fairly close to the shore. #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atclassof2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020 #vermont #longtrail"

We made it 55 days into the adventure and 230.6 miles. West Virginia to New Jersey. It‚Äôs crazy to think that I walked that far, however that‚Äôs about 2,000 miles less than I hoped. We have unfortunately decided to hop off trail due to reoccurring injuries. I‚Äôm very bummed about this and still continue to get sad when I think about it. The decision feels like it came too quickly. If you‚Äôve been following along and remember, 10 days in I sprained both ankles and found out I had heel spurs. My ankles healed and for a while were doing very well. My legs were getting stronger, my cardio stronger, and my mental strength and optimism were honing in. Then after 6 really hard falls in one week they went to crap again. Took a few more days off, got back on and took another spill and felt my right ankle pop again. Took another couple days off and  went to urgent care because I was also experiencing a burning/Charlie horse sensation in the arches of my feet intermittently through out the day. Turns out I had another sprained ankle and plantar fasciitis in both feet. I‚Äôve had it before but never experienced it like that. Knowing that this was the reality, it was best to make a decision to get off. Even though I‚Äôm sad about this, I literally feel like I can take on anything challenging physically and mentally! I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs next in regards to the trail but at least I know it‚Äôs always there. I 100% want to finish it whether that be section hiking or attempting a thru again in the near future. I know what I need to work on and some gear changes I would do next time. Thank you for all the encouragement through this journey!! Here‚Äôs to more hikes and backpacking in the future! For now it‚Äôs relaxing and visiting friends before heading back home. Special thank you to the Hayworth‚Äôs for rescuing us when we needed it as well as the Taylor/Veccia clan for rescuing us too and letting us join in on family vacation in the Shenandoahs. :) Stay tuned for our last video of when we were on trail and some highlights!<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #appalachiantrail2020 #atthruhike #atnobo2020 #atflipflop #atflipflop2020"

Then I took @erininthesky to the boardwalk section of the trail I completed the day before about 5-6 miles complete but not accounted for on my watch since it was completed yesterday. Then went to a great lunch before I said goodbye to Erin. I started at about 2pm and with the wonderful section of #stairwaytoheaven on a Saturday it was a madhouse of people on the trail. I got a really cool bonus for today after completing 14.86 miles, the drive in movie theater let‚Äôs thru hikers stay and camp and also watch movies completely free!

Yet again, I couldn‚Äôt be happier. <br><br>The day wasn‚Äôt always like this. I lost my sandals at Max Patch today, which frustrated me to no end. We figured they fell off my pack while we stopped for pictures at a campsite, but when I ran back to fetch them, they were gone.<br><br>I was sour. I made self-deprecating jokes. I marched down the trail a breakneck speed practically stomping my feet. I wanted to be alone to work out my disappointment in myself, yet I stayed by Doc. We laid on a rock and stared up at the leaves and the sky while we elevated our feet, and I felt better.<br><br>Last night‚Äôs night sky was a sight to behold. After graciously receiving some beers from a buncha folks (Doc lovingly calling it redneck trail magic) at an air traffic control station, we wandered up the trail at Snowbird Peak to find a lush camping spot with an incredible view of blue and purple mountains that go on forever. The sky was clear and we had talked earlier that we‚Äôd be able to see stars, a rare sight in our green tunnel.<br><br>We stayed there, and watched a blood moon rise up from the horizon and peek out behind the clouds. It looked like a meteor aimed for Earth, it was so bright. Like fire. To the left and right were lightening storms about 100 miles away. After relentlessly researching and game-planning an emergency escape if the storms approached, we stayed and laid there identifying stars, watching the flashes of lightning in the sky and the moon creep higher above our heads. In the morning, we watched again as the sun rose above the flowers and grasses. <br><br>I hadn‚Äôt thought about this part when I envisioned this trip. The moon, the Arabian-night-like colors of the sky, the way the sun dips behind the turtle shell of a nearby mountain. The light practically pink. <br><br>I also didn‚Äôt think about who I would do these things with, and how great it is to have a partner, a buddy, a friend to enjoy these with. #athiker #atthruhike #atnobo2020 #atflipflop  #womenwhohike #freedom #sunset #sunrise #hiking #adventure #camping"

Early in the day I passed over I-90; then I passed beaver ponds, pine stands, and a few rocky stretches. Boss and I kept passing each other all day whenever one of us  would stop to rest or eat. <br><br>I made such good time that I decided to push on into Dalton. The Trail goes right through town past the home of Tom Levardi, who generously allows thru hikers to camp in his yard. Tom has plenty of refreshments on hand for Boss and me: cold drinks, fresh fruit, and brownies made by his neighbor. <br><br>I pitched my tent and left the rain fly off, since it was such a nice evening. Then I walked a few blocks into town to the local sub shop - getting one for dinner and one to pack out for tomorrow, of course. On the way back, I got an ice cream cone, and then.... it started to drizzle, though there was no rain cloud above. I hurried back to Tom‚Äôs and found that he had thrown a tarp over my tent to keep it dry, but not before some rain had seeped in.

Someone had placed a dozen Sprites and Fantas in a roadside stream. I noticed it while fetching water; I helped myself. <br><br>Boss and I made it to the pond by 3pm and were quickly in the water. It felt luxurious! We let the air dry us. <br><br>I then made dinner at the nearby cabin. It was locked, but there was a picnic table on the deck, and enough room for Boss to set up her tent. After dinner I went to the bona fide tenting area, set myself up in one of the platforms, and crawled inside.

Later, I was grateful he did. Joe explained that most years he puts 12 jugs out during July and checks them every day. During the year of the pandemic, however, only 8 were necessary and he checked them every third day. <br><br>I stopped for lunch at the Tom Leonard Shelter, which had a sculpture garden of fungi adorning a tree trunk nearby. <br><br>I then went by Benedict Pond, and The Ledges, which offered a view of Mt.

I arranged to have a shuttle driver meet me at Rt. 7 near Great Barrington at 6pm to take me to the TravelLodge where I could shower and do laundry. My clothes and I were so sweaty and grungy I could barely stand it. I had my work cut out for me, bc there were 3 very steep, very rocky mountains to crest before making my destination. <br><br>I hiked up a Bear Mountain early just as the mist was beginning to lift. A beautiful sight. There was no sign but I was in my 11th state - Massachusetts!<br><br>I hiked down the other side and along Sage‚Äôs Ravine until I came to a large swimming hole Jedi had reminded me about. I stripped down to my shorts and waded in and under. Refreshing!<br><br>Since I had nothing to dry myself with except my damp camp towel, and bc my shirt was so grungy, I went shirtless the rest of the day, which was just as well bc it soon became a scorcher. <br><br>I hiked up mountain #2 - Mt. Race - which offered a stunning ledge walk w views to the south. Unfortunately I couldn‚Äôt take any pictures bc I needed to conserve power to check in a my ride later on. <br><br>There were ripe blueberries along the summit trail and I grabbed a few handfuls as I went along. Back down off Race, and then right back up Mt. Everett. The going was tough on the way back down, as it was steep and the path at times nonsensical. At the bottom, I cameled up at a stagnant stream: I filtered 2 liters, guzzled them down, and filtered 2 more. Water was tough to come by today on these mountains. <br><br>There was one more steep decline, and that‚Äôs where I met Socks, a very thirsty section hiker heading up. He asked about water, and I told him where I‚Äôd gotten mine, but he looked *really* thirsty. He said he had 6 oz., so I gave him half a liter of mine. <br><br>I cruised the rest of the way. Joe, my ride, was already there. He said he had just started shuttling hikers again on July 1st. He was shuttling one hiker a day; last year, he said he averaged more than 10/day in July. #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atclassof2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020 #at2020 #massachusetts"

A bike path puts you right in the parking lot of LaBonne‚Äôs market, which is an excellent place to resupply. I got a couple peaches, 2 great deli sandwiches (packed one for dinner) and some California rolls for something a little different. Of course I got 3 Powerades, chugging 2 and packing one. <br><br>There was a little gravel stone plaza behind LaBonne‚Äôs that‚Äôs called Hiker Square, w outlets protruding from the ground that can be used to recharge your electronics. I spent a couple hours there doing just that and drying off from the morning humidity as the sun came out. <br><br>At around 4 I headed out of town for a 3 mile jaunt to the Riga Shelter area. When I got there I found that this shelter had one of the best views of any on the Trail, overlooking the Twin Lakes. I pitched my tent at one of the several well manicured sites, and hung my sweaty clothes on a makeshift clothesline. #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atclassof2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020 #connecticut"

Soon I saw an outcrop called St. John‚Äôs Ledge which had a fantastic view of the Housatonic River far below as well as the ridge beyond. I stopped for breakfast and marveled at the beautiful sight. <br><br>Suddenly, the view got even more beautiful, when the ‚ÄúConnecticut Girls‚Äù, Susan and Laurie, happened by! üòâüòâüòâ Susan‚Äôs intrepid canine Finn wouldn‚Äôt sit still for a pic until I said the magic word - ‚Äúbacon!‚Äù He took notice (they always take notice). <br><br>Laurie told me she had a friend who was hiking three trails, the AT, the PCT, and the CDT, *simultaneously*! He‚Äôd do a stretch on one, then fly to another. Sounds a bit much for me. <br><br>Once I got down off these shelf-like ledges, S&L said I‚Äôd enjoy a hike along the Housatonic. They were right. It was one of my favorite hikes so far - pasture to one side, the river to the other, hiking under large trees on pine straw. <br><br>Climbing up again, at a road crossing I came to a lunch bag marked ‚ÄúTRAIL MAGIC‚Äù. Alas! There was nothing left inside. Surrounding the bag were rocked signed in sharpie by other hikers who thanked the trail angel for their treats. Sadly, I had nothing to add. <br><br>But The Trail Provides. Late in the afternoon I came to the Pine Swamp Brook Shelter, where I met a couple, Stormy and Pirate, along with Teacher. I told them how I missed out on the trail magic, and Stormy gave me her grape Powerade (she didn‚Äôt like the taste, she explained) and a Snickers bar. I didn‚Äôt need to sign a rock to thank them. Stormy and Pirate were section hiking for 10 days and planned to hike the entire Trail in 2022.

I soon crossed the Housatonic River, and after 5 miles I came to a covered bridge, Bulls Bridge, which led to a country store, where I promptly loaded up on 2nd breakfast: a hot ham egg and cheese sandwich, 2 cokes, blueberry muffin, ice cream sandwich, washed down w t obligatory 32 oz Gatorade. I got 2 pre-made deli sandwiches and voila! - I had lunch and dinner. <br><br>Today was a scorcher, so I also loaded up on 2 liters of water from the store spigot. I took it slow along the trail, stopping often to admire the view or to linger by a creek where I‚Äôd gather more water. <br><br>By 3:30pm I made it to the Mt. Algo Shelter area. It was a beautiful wooded clearing w plenty of good spots for tenting. I pitched and ate both my lunch and dinner sandwiches. <br><br>I was only a little over a mile from the town of Kent.

I got up about 5:30 and went up to the bath house area where I was able to get water from a drinking fountain. I fixed breakfast on one of several stone benches. I had the whole lake to myself so I decided to go for a swim and rinse off yesterday‚Äôs sweat and grunge. I then used the hot air hand dryer in the bathroom to attempt to dry off my clothes and pack towel, w only moderate success. <br><br>I soon came to the top of Shenandoah Mountain, where I met a young thru hiker whose trail name was Gray Man. There was a large American flag painted on the rocks there as a 9/11 memorial but it was apropos to see it on 7/4. <br><br>An hour later I reached the RPH Shelter, which appeared to have been built as part of an Eagle Scout‚Äôs project. There were more than a dozen water jugs inside, but all were empty. No matter - I cameled up using the water pump around the back. <br><br>By about 1:30 I reached my #1 goal for the day: the Mountaintop Deli, located about a half mile off the trail along Route 52. I went around the back to dry my tent and clothes and found that the NOBO thru hiking Pratt Brothers (not Frat Brothers as I‚Äôd thought the day before) were already there, sitting in some ramshackle folding chairs in the shade. We compared notes and I went inside to get lunch: an excellent roast beef sandwich which I washed down w 2 32 oz bottles of Gatorade and a watermelon pop sickle. <br><br>I told the Pratts that I was headed to the Morgan Stewart Shelter area, but that I‚Äôd wait out the sun a while before doing so to avoid hiking during the hottest part of the day. They said they‚Äôd be waiting for me when I got there and went on ahead. <br><br>I whiled away then afternoon and snoozed in the shade as all my gear became warm and dry. At 4, I ordered another roast beef sandwich for the road, packed up, and walked the final 4 miles to the Shelter. The Pratts were there, along w 2 young section hikers hammocking nearby. I found an excellent tent site at and as darkness fell I heard fireworks all around. #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atclassof2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #fourthofjuly"

A cabbie got me back to the Appalachian Deli by 10am, where I picked up an Appalachian Delight sandwich for lunch. Immediately tweaked the left leg (slightly, nbd) but it slowed me down a bit. So did rocky up and down terrain most of the day. There was also a lot of blow-down in my path.<br><br>Whew! Got 14 miles in. Got to Canopus Lake, w/in a state park and w AT camping and a big sandy beach.  A family having a beach day fed me a pork chop, chicken leg, rice and sunny d-lite.

After a couple of days I started walking around the reservoir in Central Park to work out the kinks. Just about everyone (joggers, cyclists, power walkers) was wearing masks. <br><br>Beth is starting a company called the Suck It Socket (suckitsocket.com) that makes a little doo-hickey that you can attach to your mask to let you suck down drinks w/o taking off your mask. We did a little product testing and market research by drinking margueritas at our favorite Upper West Side bodega, which had just reopened for outdoor seating. <br><br>It took forever, but I also got a replacement for my pack delivered to me (long story).

Soon JERMS joined us, and then Crush, a thru hiker who did the trail in 2019. We peppered him w questioned about the remainder of the trail from here. He assured us that the rest of New York, along with Connecticut and Massachusetts, was less challenging terrain than what we‚Äôd recently experienced, which was a relief. He said the White Mountains were ridiculously up-and-down, but doable if patient, and that Maine was mostly a beautiful walk in the woods. I couldn‚Äôt wait. Talking to Crush was some of the best Trail Magic we had received during our whole journey. <br>The four of us ventures on to the Graymoor Spiritual Life Center, a peaceful place maintained by Franciscan friars who made the outfield of the baseball field available to thru hikers. It had a water spigot, a shower, and an extension cord we could use to recharge our devices. <br>Viking hiked on, and JERMS, Tablesaw and I shared tales of the Trail over dinner at the picnic tables before retreating to our tents for the night. #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atclassof2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020 #newyork"

I‚Äôm sitting by Knob Creek, the first heavily flowing body of water I‚Äôve seen in days. Yesterday, I spent what may have been 45 minutes trying to collect water from what was generously a puddle. <br>I stayed by myself last night in every sense of the word. My two friends, Mandi and Eric, both drove off for home yesterday afternoon after a joyous few days of camping. I miss their company. As much as I was looking forward to doing this trek solo, I enjoy the camradery of people. Like splitting a bottle of Fireball, laughing and getting tipsy as the rain petered down around us. Like talking to each other from the comforts of our sleeping bags in our own closed tents. Like waking up to pick things up right where we left off.<br><br>Yesterday, I spent the night utterly alone. I was the only person at Standing Indian shelter‚Äôs campsite. No one to say hi to, let alone a tent to take mental note that someone else is here. I‚Äôm not afraid of people here, not really. So long as I‚Äôm more than a mile from a busy road, strangers don‚Äôt concern me. <br>I‚Äôm obsessed with the dire needs of bears, namely of my food and to smell inside my tent. Being alone meant I had to confront that fear myself.<br><br>I struggled to hang a bear bag. After searching for a branch long enough to hold my bags and far enough from camp to let me sleep, I kept knotting up the line when I threw it. When I finally got a line up, I forgot to clip it so I could make a proper PCT bear hang, and then the rope broke. I eventually got it hung and listened through the night to sounds resembling bears in the brush cruising for a tuna snack. <br>A fat bird kept flying around in the morning, it‚Äôs wings sounding like the huff or chuff of a bear. But alas, no bear peeked it‚Äôs nose under my tent. No bear pulled or knawed down my bear bags. I came away unscathed and when I realized that this morning, I thanked the Lord. <br>I need to have faith I will find a new group of people to camp with. I have faith. <br>#athiker #at2020thruhike #atnobo2020 #atflipflop #campingalone #womenwhohike"

Inn (1405.7/+9.7) Viking and I awoke at first light and saw, not 100 yards away, the shelter that had been our late night goal yesterday. We had made it after all. The light we had seen was the headlamp of a hammocker off in the trees; apparently he hadn‚Äôt replied bc he wasn‚Äôt at the shelter, but was nonetheless interested in our presence. <br>I found the trail, then looked and looked for blazes. I spent a good five minutes searching for the way forward when I looked up the impossibly steep and rocky incline... and found it at the top. The path I least wanted to take. <br>Once cresting that rise the Trail wasn‚Äôt as merciless as it had been the day before. After nine miles we came to some beautiful benches overlooking mountains over which we had come at the top of Bear Mountain. The Perkins Memorial Tower was a sight to behold, but even more so were the nearby... vending machines! Viking and I each got 2 Powerades and an ice cream. <br>It was 10:30am; we had made good time. We walked down the stone stairs past throngs of day hikers, then I entered the Bear Mountain Inn. I checked in, and headed straight for the shower. Soon Beth arrived to find me clean - but not my clothes. The Inn did not offer guest laundry, so I did the best I could in the sink. It was a long, filthy process. I used the hair dryer to dry my shirts, shorts and socks. <br>The Inn‚Äôs restaurant and most facilities were closed, but Beth had brought some gin and limes. We ordered 2 pizzas and soda waters to complete the meal, which we decided to eat on a bench just outside. Beth lives on the Upper West Side of Manhattan and hadn‚Äôt gotten many chances to be in the great outdoors. We enjoyed a lovely evening in each other‚Äôs company.  #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atclassof2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020 #newyork #bearmountain #bearmountaininn"

My legs were tired and sore, I ran out of vitamin I, the heat was oppressive, the rocks were impossibly steep, the trail was poorly marked so I got lost for the first time ever, there wasn‚Äôt a lot of water available, and an aggressive bear was haunting the vicinity of one of the shelters along the way. On top of all that I needed to cover a lot of ground in order to meet my girlfriend Beth at the Bear Mountain Inn at noon the next day. <br>I started at 6:45am, but the going was so rough I made it only 9 miles by 3pm (usually I could do 10+ by 12pm). I pushed my way through the Lemon Squeeze, a tight slot between rock slabs that made me wish I had taken my pack off to negotiate it. <br>I kept plugging away, and as the sun set I caught up to Viking, who was making dinner on a log. We commiserated, and I mentioned my lack of ibuprofen, and he gave me some Motrin. I normally made it a policy not to share items from other hikers due to COVID, but I‚Äôd known Viking for greater than a quarantine period and besides, relieving my throbbing knee was of paramount importance. <br>I needed to push on to at least the William Brien Memorial Shelter, 3.5 miles on, I explained, and Viking agreed to accompany me. Shortly thereafter, to make things more challenging, my phone ran out of power; Viking‚Äôs had earlier in the day. So we couldn‚Äôt check GPS to figure out how close we were to our destination. We hiked for two hours in the dark until we finally saw a light about a hundred yards away to our right. ‚ÄúHello!‚Äù I called out. No answer. We hiked a short distance further and our headlamps illuminated a large white tent. Exhausted, we decided that we could not take another step, and cowboy camped on a flat low spot nearby. <br>It was 11pm. I collapsed and was immediately asleep. I had hiked 20 miles in 16 hours, a pace of 1.25mph, about half my normal pace. #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atclassof2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020"

There were excellent views to the northwest from the boulder pile at the top of the ridge. <br>On the way up, I met an older but very muscular and fit gentleman who must have been in his 60‚Äôs, w snow white hair and beard. He asked me if I was thru hiking, and when I said I was he said ‚ÄúI hiked the trail 40 years ago.  I was 1 of 9 who hiked SOBO, and there were 150 who hiked NOBO.‚Äù I mentioned that I was 2020 registrant #715 when I started, amazed at how the trail‚Äôs popularity had grown. <br>I asked him what his trail name was. ‚ÄúI hiked w 2 other guys and we called ourselves Hickory Dickory Doc.‚Äù I asked which of the three he was. ‚ÄúWe never distinguished. We were just known by that name collectively.‚Äù I supposed I wouldn‚Äôt have wanted to get stuck w the name Dickory, so their approach seemed sensible. ‚ÄúI have advice for you,‚Äù the sage hiker said. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget time look left and right every once in a while.‚Äù Excellent Trail wisdom, I thought.<br><br>By mid-afternoon I made it to my ninth state - New York! And was immediately put to the test. It was as if t state said ‚ÄúYou want a piece of me, hiker? I‚Äôll give you rocks and poorly marked trails! I‚Äôll give you a hike!‚Äù It was brutal, but there were some nice views of Greenwood Lake.<br><br>By 7:30pm I reached the Bellvale Creamery, a popular destination for locals and hikers alike. I had been warned of the hour-long wait for ice cream, and again bc of the hot Father‚Äôs Day the line of masked patrons was exceptionally lengthy. I instead opted to recharge my electronics at the charging station and get potable water from the spigot.  I hiked 2 miles to the Wildcat Shelter, and tented near Iron Heart, Cowboy and Tablesaw. #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atclassof2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020"

Jedi texted me to say he might be headed for the ‚ÄúSecret Shelter‚Äù today. Secret Shelter? I thought. Sounds intriguing. I got there mid-morning and was greeted by Jake, a donkey who lives on the property (owned by a former thru hiker). You might say he‚Äôs the world‚Äôs only... Jake-ass! ü§£ü§£ü§£ I found an outdoor shower on a nearby building, and since Jake‚Äôs eyes were the only ones to shock, I stripped down and cleaned up. The shower was luxurious!<br><br>I soon heard a car coming up the dirt road so I threw my shorts back on. A small car w 5 teenagers inside pulled up. The one who I assumed was the leader hopped out. ‚ÄúYou hiking the whole Trail?‚Äù He asked. ‚ÄúYup,‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs crazy,‚Äù he said, impressed. He asked a few more questions and always said ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs crazy‚Äù in response to my replies. Finally, their plans to no doubt hang at the shelter dashed, the pack drive away. <br>Soon Jim Murray, the owner of the shelter property, showed up w Zen Dragon, a woman who tended some chickens and ducks in a nearby coop. I had a brief conversation w Jim and then napped on the deck, w Jake grazing nearby. <br>After my nap I packed up and headed downhill a couple miles to Horler‚Äôs deli, just over the state line in Unionville, New York. They had everything a hiker needs, so I loaded up w supplies, including two Italian sandwiches (lunch + dinner) and three bacon-egg-and-cheeses (breakfasts), various clif bars, oatmeal, trail mix. My lunch also included my favorite trail delicacy - Gatorade - and a pint of mint chocolate chip. <br>I got back to the trail and ended up hiking w Spice and Sherpa Mike. We heard thunder and hurried along to find water and a campsite before any rain came down. We came to a stream and cameled up; I pitched my tent but the other two hiked on. #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atclassof2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020 #newjersey"

The terrain in New Jersey has some rocky spots, but generally is flatter and smoother than Rocksylvania, so this seemed doable. <br>I passed Colonel Clothesline + Sunset, who had started a NOBO thru hike, then got off the trail due to COVID, then jumped ahead to get to Katahdin while the weather was still good. They were doing 12-15 mile days and their feet hurt. I gave them some advice on what helped me and then pushed on. <br>I caught up to Spice and Grimm at the Mashipacong Shelter, where there was a cache of 30 gallons of water in the bear box - like finding gold on a hot day like today. <br>I finally got to High Point (the highest point in NJ) around 8:30 and ate my dinner at an observation deck overlooking the High Point Obelisk. The magenta of the twilight sky along w lights at the foot of the monument gave it a beautiful ethereal quality. <br>After dinner, I hiked to the High Point Shelter (half a mile on) and found it unoccupied. I heard thunder in the distance, so I set up shop in the shelter for the night.

State #8! <br>The terrain was fairly forgiving, though there were some rocky stretches. Bounce soon passed me; then, I re-injured my right calf (slightly). While fetching water in a stream I met Kodak, a woman who started in Georgia, got off after COVID spread, and who was now flip-flopping and heading north. <br>I passed a beaver bog and three beavers immediately tried to scare some away by slapping their tails upon the water. It had the opposite effect - I had to get a vid of them doing it. <br>With the late start (9:30am) I decided that a 24-mile day to the next Shelter was a bit ambitious, and I pitched my tent at one of the many campsites along the ridge. Since I had the place to myself I shucked all my grimy clothes and let them dry out on a rock while I aired out my skin. <br>I fell asleep to the sounds of coyotes and a whippoorwill. <br>#at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atclassof2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020 #newjersey"

Bounce explained he had taken a bit of a break in Pennsylvania bc he has family there.

I figured since, like me, they‚Äôd been on the trail for weeks, the risk of COVID was low, and besides it was getting late and sharing a room would save me some moola.

Not sure what happened to the owls but the alarming cry came from my soon-to-be-new-friend, Crocks. A long-distance runner, he‚Äôd been pushing himself too hard to get too many miles. His body wasn‚Äôt having it. He‚Äôd puked last night out of his hammock into his Crocks.<br><br>Day 4 <br>June 9<br>I began talking to my water bottle today. It was being very uncooperative. ... I hear woodpeckers on the daily and other birds tweeting around me. Haven‚Äôt seen many though, save a warbler or two. I walk around with a bell to let bears know I‚Äôm coming. Turns out it warns birds I‚Äôm coming, too. I‚Äôd like to see more birds. Until then, I‚Äôll listen for them.<br><br>Day 6<br>June 11 <br>I climbed Blood Mountain today, the highest mountain in Georgia. As I lay down to sleep, I can see a well-known hiker store and hostel, Mountain Crossings, where people throw their terrible hiking shoes into trees. They have a huge AT sign there and I posed with it, smiling. I smile all the time now. As I lay in my tent a short walk from the road, all I can hear is the rustling of the leaves and the occasional roar from strange creatures known as cars. #athiker #at2020thruhike #atnobo2020 #atclassof2020 #at2020 #atflipflop #hiker #hikingadventures #happyhiker #happyhiker #adventurenthusiasts #adventuretime #nobo #sobo #womenexplore_"

Thank you to my trail angels, Dave and Karen @stationat19e, for bringing my beautiful new pair of Lone Peak 4.5‚Äôs to me for the next 800 miles! Definitely bittersweet leaving my old pair behind. Also - don‚Äôt think I forgot! Happy Father‚Äôs Day to my hiking partner and lifetime role model. I love you Dad ‚ù§Ô∏è #atclassof2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #fathersday #va #altra #altrarunning"

I decided to try to make this my first marathon day (hiking 26.2 miles). At mile 15 I came to Stony Creek, which had been dammed up by beavers. I had to ford the creek by walking across the top of the dam, which was submerged by 2 feet, in my  crocs (my ‚Äúcamp shoes‚Äù that I usually wore at the end of the day). Later, while getting water at another creek, I watched as a very old woman tried to cross on the rickety logs that served as a bridge. ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt they put a bridge here?‚Äù She whined indignantly. Her companion, a younger woman, explained that a couple years ago she had hiked the trail w an even older woman friend of hers, and that friend had become the oldest woman to hike the AT. This lady was in training to break her friend‚Äôs record when she was old enough - in 2022. <br>While in the home stretch of my marathon, I glanced down and happened to see a pocket knife lying on the trail. It was in excellent condition. ‚ÄúSomeone‚Äôs going to be missing this,‚Äù I thought, so I picked it up and carried it on. I was right. When I got to the William Penn Shelter (marathon day achieved!), I met a young gal named Fern who asked me if I‚Äôd seen a black knife.

Legions of day hikers swarmed the nearby trails. Most people were careful, stepping aside to give good social distance when passing and otherwise being polite. But I was reminded of the words of the ranger I had met at McAfee Knob: ‚ÄúWe closed the parks and trailheads because every day was like Labor Day...‚Äù.

Then it was over the gigantic dam itself and uphill into Great Smoky Mountains National Park. I climbed nearly 3,000 feet in elevation to some ledges offering a spectacular view to the northwest - a good spot to have lunch. <br>Made it to the Russell Field Shelter where I reunited with Empty Space and Jet, whom I hadn‚Äôt seen since since the Easter dinner at Boots Off hostel.

My phone was so damp the touchscreen wouldn‚Äôt work, so Bender did the honors for me and texted the photo you see. <br>Then it was on to the AT Museum in Pine Grove Furnace State Park and The Half Gallon Challenge, in which hikers absurdly try to down a half gallon of ice cream in order to win a tiny wooden spoon denoting their membership in the gluttonous club.

I left the Appalachian Trail in March due to the coronavirus pandemic that was sweeping the globe. When I got home, I fell hard into ‚Äúpost trail depression‚Äù. I knew it was real in the backpacker community but I didn‚Äôt think I would really get it because I would be happy to be back with my friends and family. But when I got home, I couldn‚Äôt be with anyone. We were quarantined to our house and couldn‚Äôt leave. I didn‚Äôt want to do anything. I laid in bed and just watched tv. I didn‚Äôt get out of bed, I didn‚Äôt go outside. After a few weeks, I tried to get out of my funk. I started to get back into doing art and it started to help. Eventually, I was able to go back to work and I thought that would really help since I wouldn‚Äôt be stuck at home anymore. Unfortunately, it didn‚Äôt help. I fell back into my depression and have been struggling for weeks to feel better. I took a week off and went to Arizona and hiked on the AZT. It was such a relief. I felt alive again. I needed to feel that more. At this point, I need to do what is best for my mental health. I have decided to go back to the Appalachian Trail in a few weeks and continue on my hike. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll be there for a month or two or I stay and try to finish the whole thing. All I know if my mental health needs me to get better and this is how I feel I can do that. I plan to take all the precautions I can to minimize the probability of being exposed or exposing others. I will be bringing my mask for when I‚Äôm in town and having hand sanitizer with me. I know this isn‚Äôt the best timing to be going back but mental health is very important and I‚Äôve got to do what I‚Äôve got to do. I hope everyone understands that I have to do this for myself.

As soon as I see one of those white rectangles ahead my heartbeats a little bit faster and so much excitement sets in. After those feelings pass it slowly leads into a calmness. A sense of peace and the ability to breath a little deeper and it allows my mind to unwind and just let‚Äôs me be me stripped down to the core. The magic of those little bits of paint you see every so often transports me to where I want to be and long to be when I‚Äôm not near them.

Some wore masks, and most were mindful of social distancing, moving off trail to let me pass or thanking me for doing so. <br>When I got into town I realized that West Virginia had just allowed restaurants to reopen if they seated dining parties at least six feet apart. I sat on the back patio of one establishment and had a pulled pork sandwich and 3 vanilla milkshakes. <br>I then walked up to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy HQ where I had arranged the meet Chris Lienhard, an old high school classmate who lives near Harper‚Äôs Ferry and whom I hadn‚Äôt seen in 35 years. It was great to compare notes and find out what Chris had been up to since we gathered our diplomas. <br>Walking through town I bumped into Viking, who told me he was staying at the Town‚Äôs Inn, a 200 year old stone building in the center of town. The innkeeper heard me and offered me. Very good rate to share the common room w Viking and Zebra, and I agreed to spend the night there. #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020"

Sure there are cars and it‚Äôs not really nature, but this footbridge was the only thing I knew about the Appalachian Trail prior to 5 years ago. I‚Äôve passed it frequently in my life and remember passing it as a kid and wondering what it was and wanting to walk that bridge because I thought it was cool that it went over the highway. Well day 4 this week I got to walk it! Shout out to the one truck that honked, made my day! Especially since the immediate uphill to Annapolis Rocks sucked soooooooooo bad! After 7 days out, we made it to PA, and are taking a zero. Celebrated with eating salad. It truly was what I was craving after not having a big appetite this week. We took it slow and steady to make sure we didn‚Äôt over do it. But the last couple of days, my pack has felt more a part of me rather than a hindrance. And I feel my legs getting stronger.

One head strap had already frayed off, and both shoulder straps were just days away from tearing off as well. Fortunately, the clerk at the outfitters - a man whose real name (not trail name) was Charlie Brown - was able to get a replacement from the same manufacturer at no charge! It was a slightly different model but had the same capacity as my old pack and was a pound lighter. It was slightly smaller (a medium instead of a medium-large) and the fit  not quite as good (I could feel it a bit in the small of my back) but for the price it is definitely worth a shot.

Pack is VERY full. It‚Äôs heavier than I expected. Heading to the #appalachiantrail tomorrow and I am very excited and nervous. Here‚Äôs to my ‚Äúwhy‚Äù. My reasoning for taking on this difficult and hopefully rewarding journey.<br>1) Time to process. Over the course of the past year there has been grief, sadness, and change. Time to process this with no distractions as well as figure out what‚Äôs next.<br>2) Spiritual growth. I would be lying if I said I was really thriving with my relationship with the Lord. It‚Äôs been a dry season and definitely related to the reasons behind number 1. <br>3) Happy endorphins from exercise. I‚Äôm not kidding. I love the feeling of confidence you get when you‚Äôve accomplished something you didn‚Äôt think you could do. Need to kick some mountain butt for a few sweet views.<br>4) Physical transformation. Not the primary purpose, but and added side effect to walking all day with a 30lb pack on your back up and down mountains. Side effect I will welcome with open arms. It‚Äôs not common for most women, but being overweight it will most likely happen.<br>5)Adventure, fun, community. Makes for great stories haha.<br>Here‚Äôs to the trail! Nerves, excitement, emotions, and all! <br>#appalachiantrail2020 #appalachiantrailflipflop #atflipflop2020 #atnobo2020<br>#atsobo2020 #backpacking #trek #adventure #funnygirls #hiking"

It was very cold, and by 7:30 my driver had not arrived. <br><br>A little desperate, I went across the road (US 60), and up a dirt road to a small, dilapidated house and knocked on the door. A tall, young man opened the door and once I explained my plight, agreed to take me into town. He waited in the parking lot of the Food Lion while I got my supplies. <br><br>I offered to buy him breakfast, but he refused and instead insisted on buying *me* breakfast, saying ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the one hiking the AT‚Äù.

I had a bacon double cheeseburger, fries, and 3 cookies-n-cream milkshakes. I packed out an additional cheeseburger and fries after spending an hour sunning myself (as best I could in the clouded sun) on the camp store deck. <br>After 4 miles I came to Bryant Ridge Shelter, one of the largest on the trail. I had begun to worry that the specter of the coronavirus would get worse in the trail as time went on, so I vowed to make this the last time I slept in a shelter. This was a good last hurrah.

We praise God He broke her fall which could have been much farther down the ravine.  She was able to get up and make it down to a parking area for extraction.  God showed up and showed out with protection, a local hiker/trail magic to pull us out the back forestry road as the temps dropped and McKayla with girls were able to pick us up in Franklin.  There are so many ways He showed us He cares.  We shouldn't have had reception.  We shouldn't have been so close to a pull out.  She shouldn't have been able to walk out.

Today was my mother‚Äôs 78th birthday, and she lives at an independent living facility in nearby Roanoke, so I decided to surprise her. I called shuttle driver and AT hiker Wolverine, who immediately dropped his home improvement project and drove me to her. I called my mom from the parking lot, wished her a Happy Birthday, and told her to come out on her 3rd floor apartment deck. She was properly astonished - the ultimate birthday present from her thru hiker son. I did not plan my hike around her birthday, but sometimes the Universe conspires to make one‚Äôs timing impeccable. Later I joined a Zoom conference w my siblings and mom for a virtual birthday party. My ‚Äútramily‚Äù (Bender, Grace, Fonzie, Hot Sauce, and Tom) had joined me at HoJo, where we met up w Jello and Yardsale, who I had not seen since just after Neel Gap in Georgia.

After a gracious day hiker had taken my picture (I gave her hand sanitizer) I relaxed in the beautiful sun. We hadn‚Äôt had sun like this the entire time I had been in the Trail. Part 2 of the triple crown achieved. I spent the rest of the afternoon hiking to Tinker Cliffs, where Joe, the owner of 4 Pines, had said there would be spectacular sunsets o er the Catawba Valley. I made it, and decided to pitch my tent and eat my dinner while I waited for Sol to sink in the West. Soon Fonzie, Bender, Tom, Grace, and Hot Sauce, who were fast becoming like ‚Äútramily‚Äù joined me for the viewing. It lived up to the billing.

As it turned out, there wasn‚Äôt much sunrise today, but the view was amazing nonetheless. At the Tooth, a rocky outcrop that juts more than 30 feet above the surrounding ledge, I bumped into Always and Sunny, as well as Zebra. Since I was still some distance from the next town, Daleville, I decided to head for 4 Pines Hostel. On the way, I encountered my first blooming rhododendron.  Naturally, I took a picture, as did every other hiker, I have since learned. Once at 4 Pines, Nature Boy shuttled me to the nearby general store where I loaded up on cheeseburgers, pizza, and gathered (way too much) food for resupply. Later, Fonzie‚Äôs gang arrived, as did Fonzie‚Äôs dad, Brian, from Atlanta. Brian bought a cooler full of beer and soda for all to share. Later, I played several games of chess w Bender, a British hiker, and Jedi, from Germany. This hostel was set up in the bays of a 3-car garage and was a little dusty, so I did not use my supply of hand sanitizer sparingly. <br>#at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020"

We hiked together for several miles, the first time I had done so since my 2nd day on the Trail w Southpaw. Eventually he moved in ahead as we crossed some ridge top ledges w views of the Catawba Valley to the East. This was A Tough Day At The Office for me. I slipped on a slab of ledge rock and banged my left shin, though not badly. Later, as I was fetching water from a stream, I slipped on the muddy bank and soaked both my feet. Then, I stubbed my toe while ascending onto a wooden bridge and went face down on it, banging my forehead. Luckily, I once again wasn‚Äôt hurt badly. I thought about how many other hikers had sprained their ankles, broken fingers or otherwise had been injured through a freakish misstep causing them to postpone or quit their hike, and I felt very lucky and grateful that I could continue. Late in the day I came up a small ridge to the Pickle Branch Shelter and the air was fragrant w t blossoms of spring. I camped in a clearing not far from the shelter and fell asleep to the sounds of wood thrush, whippoorwills, and a nearby babbling brook. #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020"

The trail was fairly rocky for a long stretch, making the going slow. In the early afternoon a jet fighter swooped down over the valley to the west, banked and flew directly overhead, about 500 feet, then did a barrel roll as he headed east. The pilot circled around and made about a half dozen additional fly-bys, though none were as close as the first. I guess practicing your barrel rolls is one job that isn‚Äôt affected by coronavirus. I passed by Wind Rock, in the Mountain Lake Wilderness, which offered panoramic views of West Virginia. Late in the day I caught up with Fonzie, Tom, Tuck, Grace, Bender, and Hot Sauce, who had maxed out the capacity of the Laurel Creek Shelter. I was prepared for this, and headed just a short ways down the trail and camped on the former site of an old cabin in the del between two modest ridges. No sooner had I set up my tent than it started to rain.

I hiked a lonely 20 miles at times high on a ridge that formed the VA/WV border.

Neville at Wood‚Äôs Hole had met him and assured us that he suffered from night terrors but was not dangerous. I was relieved when I got to the Shelter and found a merry band: Wiki, Jedi, and Owl Cat and her Jack Russell terrier PR. Waldo soon joined us.

As I did so, the rain turned to sleet, then snow. Fortunately I was nestled underneath the pines. Unfortunately, when I moved to put my left boot on, about a half a cup of water poured out of it. Not a great beginning to the day. But, as the Trail taught me April 1st, I knew I could hike with a wet foot as long as the temperature didn‚Äôt stay below freezing and if I kept moving. <br>I broke camp and hiked across the rocky, and often bald Grayson Highlands. High winds whipped past me and seemingly through me. As I rounded a bend I came upon 5 wild ponies. They roam the Grayson Highlands freely. They looked calmly at me as if to say ‚ÄúWhat? You‚Äôre not unnerved by a little wind and snow, are you?‚Äù Right then I decided...no, I wasn‚Äôt unnerved at all. I had the right layers on, was generating enough heat as I hiked, and I knew where I was going. It was good to take note their example. The sun gradually vanquished the wind.

Eventually I crossed VA 600 and began my ascent into the Grayson Highlands, open grassy balds with incredible panoramic views of mountain ranges to the south and west.

The terrain was relatively easy to what I‚Äôd experienced so far, so this would be a good opportunity to do so.  I passed through a low area, traversed several wooden bridges over swampy land, crossed TN 91 and into a pasture that offered a stunning view of the valley to the southwest at twilight. As I sat on a stone bench overlooking this vista, I decided to reach down and pick up two small rocks as souvenirs for my kids. I would tell them about this view and that I thought of them at this moment. I pitched my tent as what seemed like a half dozen Baird owls hooted and cackled their displeasure at my encroachment on their hunting grounds. Exhausted, but very satisfied with my longest hike yet - 23.8 miles in one day - I quickly fell asleep.  #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachiantrail2020 #appalachianmountains"

I awoke to sporadic lightning and, fortunately, not much rain. On the way past the two high balls I had to clear though,there was a thick fog that made it difficult to see my pathway through the pre-dawn gloom. But I achieved my goal with 15 minutes to spare! Breakfast buffet menu: egg souffl√©, maple bacon hash browns, sausage, fresh fruits, tomato and mozzarella, various first-rate homemade pastries topped off with bottomless cups of coffee and orange juice (only partial breakfast pictured). I spent the rest of the day up the road at another hostel, The Station, where I got a private room, did laundry, showered, and even repaired my tent zipper, which had been broken for weeks (YouTube how-tos FTW!). #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachiantrail2020 #appalachianmountains"

The plan was for another long hike, to Doll Flats (about 16 miles) which would put me 3 miles from where US 19E crosses the trail and very close to two good hostels. Hiked through the rain and the mist and the cold until I got to Overmountain Shelter, a large barn made to replicate one built during the time of the Overmountain Boys (revolutionary wars heroes from Carolina) and one which could accommodate an army of thruhikers until it was deemed structurally unsafe in 2019. Still, I decided to change my plans and camp here due to the spectacular view of the valley to the south with ridge upon ridge of mountains beyond. I decided to get up very early and ‚Äúfly by night‚Äù to Mountain Harbour B&B at US 19E 9 miles on for their ‚ÄúBest Breakfast on the Trail‚Äù before they closed their dining room at 9am. #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachiantrail2020 #appalachianmountains"

Got caught in a flash thunderstorm shortly afterwards - I‚Äôve rarely seen so much water come down so fast - and my shorts got drenched.

It felt like forever before I could see Mountain Crossings. The first thing I did was buy a Banana and get a cup of hot coffee. I sat around and talked with others about the Morning hike. Then time to order that pizza and get a room in the bunk house. I got the last bed üëèüèº pizza came and I was so excited. Four slices later I was stuffed üòÇ I guess hiker hunger was not there, it never came for me I was not on trail long enough darn it . Anyway .. the bunk house... I got the last bunk it was a top bunk under the air ducts with about 8inches head space. Showered settled in and got comfy with everyone. The room had a huge selection of old VHS the group chose a 1934 black&white Bride of Frankenstein movie to watch üòú. Bedtime 8:30. Then the snore symphony began. At around 4am I could not get back to sleep with all the noise so in the dark I somehow managed to climb of the bunk and after walking into another bunk finally found the door to the living room another hiker was asleep there so I slept with my feet in a cabinet on the kitchen floor üòÇ. I paid $20 for that experience and would do it again in a heartbeat üëäTHANK YOU MOUNTAIN CROSSING.

Many hikers have quit or put their hike on hold, disheartened by the idea of having to skip over a celebrated portion of the trail. I began planning to go as far as Fontana Dam, on the southern edge of the Smokies, and find transportation around them, then return later to complete the section when the park reopens. This morning the situation shifted once again, and I heard that on March 27th the county where Fontana Dam is located is going to put a police barricade on the trail, and won‚Äôt admit any hikers. I‚Äôm sort of proud- in all my years traveling with punk bands, I‚Äôve never had an entire county call the cops on us two days in advance! Fortunately, I should be able to get a shuttle from the Nantahala Outdoor Center tomorrow.<br><br>If you try to beat the Trail, the Trail will beat you; I can‚Äôt control anything that‚Äôs happening, only how I choose to respond. Having started this journey SOBO, I signed up for adventure, a challenge, and a transformative experience- not hostels, trail magic, or partying with a big bubble of other hikers.

Prior to this point, our longest backpacking trip was only 50 miles. You hear the statistics that one in four don't make it the entire way and I remember thinking there was a possibility we may be in that 25 percent. I remember being at the lodge the night before and staring up at the 20ft map of the trail spanning 2,192 miles and thinking ""are we really going to walk that entire way?"".<br>‚Ä¢<br>There were definitely several times I physically and mentally wanted to quit and felt like giving up. The blisters, the chafing, the rocks in PA, the suffocating heat, the mosquitoes in MA..to name a few struggles. Each day brought it's own challenges, but each day brought it's own beauty. A new mountain to climb, a new person to meet, a new view to take in, a new conversation.<br>‚Ä¢<br>It's so easy to go about our daily lives now and watch as days turn into weeks that blur past us. The trail makes you feel present. I feel like I can remember small moments so vividly. A single day on trail holds so many memories. We will always miss the simplicity, but we will try to live as simple as the trail does.<br>‚Ä¢<br>I can't imagine how different things would be right now if we didn't decide to quit our jobs and take off on the biggest adventure of our lives. The trail truly ruined us for the best and we couldn't be more thankful for the people we met, the memories we made and the moments we will never forget.<br>‚Ä¢<br>Our hearts hurt for those who planned to hike this year and aren't able to do so. However, we commend the difficult decision you made by staying home, because as health care workers we like to see others do their part in stopping this virus as well. If you are already on the trail please try to isolate yourself, don't sleep in shelters, avoid hostels, or maybe consider getting off trail and trying next year.

Buttercup gave us a ride into Helen, Georgia. We had to pick up meds for Tuna's cold and resupply food. Helen Georgia is a cute little Alpine Village with a lot of tourists and locals. We met a local man that was a veteran. We were able to speak openly and share stories of how suicide can affect so many people. Our new friend shared how he was affected by the loss of a loved one that died by suicide. He also has a close friend that struggles with mental health issues. He had not spoken with his close friend in a couple of weeks. He was more determined, after we spoke, to reach out  and ""check in"" with his friend. These experiences, make every cold rainy day and  muddy,  slippery step worth the journey. If you haven't reached out to a loved one you feel may need an emotional ""check in"", please reach out today.

I get it. ‚ÄúThe AT is always a short hitch to a town or resupply point.‚Äù ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs plenty of food you can buy in towns.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll never go hungry.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre wasting money by doing resupply boxes.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to waste time waiting on the post office in town.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou can survive on peanut butter and snickers!‚Äù Etc. Etc. Yeah someone actually said that last one to me. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è There‚Äôs so much divisiveness when it comes to the topic of resupplying on trail. For those NOT in the backpacking world, hikers tend to be very opinionated on all topics related to trail, especially resupply. üòÇ Understandably so. When it comes to resupplying, the consensus does usually fall on the side of saving boxes and buying in town. But for me, it‚Äôs not entirely possible. (Have I mentioned I have celiac disease? AND I‚Äôm a dietitian?!) Sure, I COULD survive on peanut butter, snickers, cheetos, nuts, etc. All are gluten free! But why would anyone want to?! Being celiac in ‚Äúreal life‚Äù is tough as it is. On trail, I can only imagine it will be worse. I don‚Äôt want to get caught in a small town without nutritious, gluten free food. I might be the exception to the resupply ‚Äúrules‚Äù, but I challenge everyone to evaluate their food choices for the adventure ahead! Eat crap = feel like crap. I‚Äôm FINALLY done prepping all of my trail dinners. Next up, is finishing breakfasts, coffees, and some snacks. Are you sending yourself anything in a resupply box?! PS- this is more boxes than necessary. I just wanted some size options for different lengths between resupplies! #atthruhike #atthruhike2020 #thruhike #thruhiker #thetrekat #thetrek #atnobo2020 #atnobo #celiac #glutenfree #dietitian"

I probably don‚Äôt want polyamid in a hat. I don‚Äôt know for sure what it is, but I have a feeling it won‚Äôt dry fast. <br>When we were having lunch at a cheese shop, I saw the @opinelofficiel knife display and decided I needed it for the trail. I carried the little Swiss tool before and it really couldn‚Äôt cut cheese, summer sausage or spread almond butter. üòÇüòÇ The Opinel is lighter I think.

This long trail typically takes hikers 4-7 months to complete with an average success rate of only 25%. I can‚Äôt wait! I will also be a contributing vlogger for @thetrek.co during my journey. My first few videos should be uploaded in the next week to their YouTube channel. I will also be posting updates and photography on my own social media.

It has been a year filled with loss, grief, and unexpected change. I have been blessed to be on staff with Cru the past 11 years and in the fall the Lord made it clear that this part of life was coming to a close. It‚Äôs been quite shocking and sad as I thought I would be on staff forever. The Lord is funny sometimes and likes to do things like that. I will be ending my time with Cru at the end of February and moving into an ‚Äúin between‚Äù time as I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôm heading next. At the end of March Tina and I will be embarking on a thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail! It‚Äôs something we have dreamed of for several years now and a gap of time has opened for that to happen. It will be much needed time to process what‚Äôs next as well as the last 11 years of ministry. Don‚Äôt worry! You will be able to keep up with the hike as we will be vlogging our adventure for The Trek! We applied and got accepted and now have this awesome online platform to share it from! Thank you to all the ministry partners over the years who have trusted the Lord and prayed for me in my ministry with Cru! God did so many awesome things and I look forward to seeing and hearing what he continues to do through the ministry of Cru. I ask for continued prayers as I finish out and process what‚Äôs next. I‚Äôm excited for this gap of time and to share a little bit of that time with you! <br>You may have a lot of questions or may be curious about how you can help as many people have asked that. Feel free to ask questions and check out this gear list of small items I put together on Amazon. Link in bio.<br><br>Again, thank you for all the love and support. And students, thank you for letting me be a part of your college lives. #thetrek #atthruhike2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #hikerhungerpoles #hikerhunger #singlelady #funnygirl #33 #tinaandhaleysepicadventures #cru @sru.cru @nwpa_cru @behrend_cru @clarioncru @thetrek.co @appalachian.trail @hikerhunger"
