I've been asked this question A LOT in the last few weeks and I'm so thankful that my answer is emphatically yes!<br><br>Sometimes I still can't believe that  my cautious self quit a stable good job to go fulfill a dream and make a big life change, but here we are! Now of course I had done years of research and preparation, but still üòÇ<br><br>Some of the people asking are thru hiker hopefuls, and to all of them, I say GO DO IT! It's such a wonderful experience of new people, places and things that I can never again replicate. BUT make sure you're at least a little prepared. It increases your chances of success by a lot and you'll have way more confidence and a better time. Ask past thru hikers if you have questions. They'll all love to answer them or can point you to someone who can. And, even if you can't do the whole thing, go do a section! It's more than most people will ever do! You're still a bad ass. <br><br>Also, keep your motivation in mind. People reccomend writing down your reasons for hiking so when you have a hard day, you can remind yourself easily why you're out there. I also had items from some people very close to me that I'd read/hold on hard days. A letter from @bonnieelvidge , a bag of kisses from @piercinggoblin , a few polaroids of Clay and me, and a space cat patch from @hurricanekatri . I'd get them out in my tent after a hard day and know I had people supporting me which is so important üíõ<br><br>I see the people getting ready for their hikes and I'm very nostalgic, but also grateful that I took this risk and now I'm living the after life that I wanted. Being back in Rochester for the last month has been wonderful. I have so many wonderful friends that live here and have been so welcoming and supportive, there's so many things to do and I'm loving my new job and the opportunity to explore a field that I think I'll love. The trail gave me a great transition time to consider what I really wanted out of life and now I'm getting to have it üíõ<br><br>#AppalachianTrail #ATThruHike #HikingIsHappiness #GoDoIt #Hiking #WomenWhoHike #OptOutside #ExploreOutdoors #BackPacking #WhiteBlaze #ATNOBO2021 #NOBO #ThruHike #Hike"

Hiking the trail gave me a new appreciation and understanding of the trail networks, partnerships, and land management strategies that are critical to building and maintaining trail systems.

We did The Thing. And then we came home. We came back. Everyone was so proud of us and excited for us and we were too. And we went back to our jobs, or our families, or started a new adventure altogether. <br><br>But we did The Thing. And this year we aren‚Äôt doing The Thing. We already did it. And this new fresh and exciting year isn‚Äôt as new or fresh or exciting as the last one. Because it can‚Äôt be. Those of you who are planning new thru hikes or other grand adventures might not feel it as deeply or at all. But it will never be the same as the first. The time you looked at your life and said ‚Äònot enough‚Äô and did something about it. And whether everything is different this year, or everything is the same, it isn‚Äôt the same. <br><br>Because we aren‚Äôt the same. And now we‚Äôre here navigating this world post doing The Thing. And it‚Äôs not bright or shiny or new. But we still did the thing, we lived our truth, we found out how we really are without showers or pretenses. We had freedom.

Just trying to figure out what 'life after' a thru-hike is going to be like. I certainly didn't come out the way I went in. My mind and body held up for 5 months and 6 days of discovering my limitations,  overcoming obstacles I had never faced, and experiencing the beauty of the trail and living moment to moment. <br><br>My feet took care of the 2193.1 miles, but there are many people that contributed to my success in so many ways. I first have to thank my very capable Support Team. I'm lucky enough that I'm in my mid 50's and still have both my parents cheering me on as they have throughout my life.<br><br>They're active, they're healthy, and they're wiling to go anyplace to help anyone they can.<br><br>I bought Mom @juliana_chauncey 's book last Christmas and she dove into it, tired eyes and all.  They picked me up at Pinkham Notch to get me to a wedding, and later drove up to Katahdin on summit day. I was floating down the Hunt Trail in the afterglow of summiting, and there they were, walking up the trail, a 1/2 mile in...wearing matching 'SUPPORT TEAM' hoodies. <br><br>We walked the last 1/2 mile of the AT together, sometimes arm in arm. At Katahdin Stream Campground Mom saw firsthand the hilarity that ensues when one asks a gathering of hikers, ""Does anyone want any cake?"" No plates were necessary,  and miraculously, no one was injured in the melee that followed what she thought was a relatively innocuous question. Everyone scored a piece of Mom's homemade summit cake. There was nothing left but frosting and the hiker fingerprints  forever captured in ble icing. <br><br>If that wasn't enough, Dad found a hiker waiting to summit the following day. The hiker was going to spread his friend's ashes at the summit, but couldn't find his group. Dad drove that man all over in an effort to find his crew. We weren't successful, but we all  saw it as a most worthy way to spend the afternoon. Sir, wherever you are, I hope you laid your friend to rest where he was meant to be.<br><br>Thank you to Mom & Dad...always there for the milestones, large and small.

I got to watch the greenery push their way through the blanket of dead leaves and sprout their bright green glow illuminating the trail.

I was raw towards myself and honest. Here‚Äôs a look at a not so good day of mine.-<br><br>Day 25: Tricorner Knob-Davenport Gap Shelter (16.9 miles) <br><br>To day was a rough day. I can honestly say it was one of the hardest days I have had out here. It was long, tough and I was very sore. <br><br>After yesterday it was hard to get up. It was hard waking up and getting moving. We had a long day ahead and I knew it was mostly downhill. When I got up my stomach did not feel good. I didn‚Äôt feel like I was in a good place to hike. Maybe overworked, maybe just <br>Tired. I‚Äôm not sure. <br><br>I shit my brains out. I took a long poop and it overflowed my hole. It was wet and savage. After that I just felt like crap. I ate a lot yesterday and had a peanut butter for breakfast. I‚Äôm not sure what happened but I felt like trash. I was struggling. I shed a tear. I was angry, bitter and felt like asshole. A flow of negative things came to mind and I just tried to keep myself together to make the distance. I wanted to puke all day and couldn‚Äôt. I could barely eat. But I did end up puking 1.5 miles from the shelter. Thankfully since I couldn‚Äôt curl up in my tent anywhere. I didn‚Äôt mean to puke but I was happy I did. I‚Äôm not sure what caused it. I ate peanut butter and morning juice and my body apparently didn‚Äôt like that. I puke up the smell of peanut butter and Lorna Doone cookies. I traded Highlander for a ramen and gave him all my peanut butter. It was the only thing I could eat. <br><br>The shelter is crowded but there were spots for us. I am overwhelmed and happy to have a spot after today but still feel bad that I got ‚Äúsick‚Äù and am in the shelter. I‚Äôm sure no one cares though. <br><br>Anywho. I feel bad but hopefully I won‚Äôt be in this space tomorrow.

We were sitting by a wide yet shallow stream. Bell sat on her pack, while I leaned against mine and planted my cheeks in the dirt. We were just eating some snacks and sitting there. It was a beautiful day; perfect hiking weather. Blue skies. Not too hot, not too cold. I remember looking at the rays of sunlight beaming through the swaying maple trees when it hit me. I just walked from Georgia to Maine. Then the other shoe dropped, this adventure was almost over. The very thought of it made me tear up. I turned to Lil Bell and told her what I was thinking about and we both agreed that we weren‚Äôt ready for it to be over. .<br><br>A few days later we were hiking in the rain. It was quite cool out and the wind had a bite to it, so there was no stopping the hike unless it was time to call it a day, and we skipped lunch. We still had two and a half miles to the shelter. Slick rocks and roots everywhere. It took all afternoon. It was while we forded the cold river that Lil Bell and I agreed that we were ready for the adventure to be over. . .&nbsp; <br><br>That night we made it to the shelter. It wasn‚Äôt crowded so we stayed there. Torrential downpour all night. The sound of the rain tapping on the shelter‚Äôs tin roof put me right to sleep. I woke up several times throughout the night just to listen to the storm. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm ready for the adventure to be over. . .<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrailthruhike #withguthook #georgiatomaine2021 #mainehikes #happytrails #atthruhike2021 #nobo<br>#thetrekat #atnobo2021 #whiteblazes #at2021  #withguthooks #thruhike #longdistancehike #thetrek #backcountrycamping #mainemountains  #hikemoreadventures #hikerlife #backpackinglife #mntfolk #trekkingtoes #hiketheearth #100milewilderness #campeverday  #hikingcultures<br> #Livefearlessly #OurOutside #hikingtheglobe <br>#leavenotracebehind"

We were moving pretty well for the majority of the day. We ended up doing a quick side adventure into a town only a mile or so off trail to get some gas station food. There, we met up with some friends who had a van they were using to support hikers on trail. They hooked us up with a slackpack for the rest of our miles for the day. Six miles before getting to town a crazy storm hit and we were only a few inches away from getting struck by lightning. It was so close I felt the electricity shock up my leg. We decided to cut the day short and get to cover.<br>The next day we got up early to finish the remaining 6 miles. We then resupplied, got some food: a delicious lobster roll, homemade pie, and ramen. Then we hit the post office and finally crossed over into New Jersey!!!!

There we feasted on pizza and ice cream and then hung out in the park. After only 10 miles we decided to stay at a place a little ways out of town and ended up taking a zero there. These couple days were some of the most memorable on trail. After escaping the vortex we climbed out of Palmerton, which was one of my favorite climbs of the entire trail & the first real ‚Äúclimbing‚Äù experience you get on trail. This stretch was tricky bc water was scarce and it was still extremely hot. There was 20 miles ahead with no water sources on trail. This means we were relying on locals filling jugs and leaving them on trail or carrying all our own water. Fortunately, we found Blue Mountain ski resort, which was walking distance from the trail. It isn‚Äôt listed on guthooks, but it‚Äôs just a short blue blaze down to the resort. We decided to head down there and grab dinner, fill our water and then finish the last 7 miles of our 15 mile day to camp afterward. It turned out to be one of the best decisions we could have made. The food was amazing and the resort was beautiful. That night we night hiked to camp and saw a bird sleeping in a tree and a porcupine that ran in front of us for at least an entire mile of walking.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>#appalachiantrail2021 #ATthruhike #thruhikingwomen #backpacking #hiking #camping #traillife #at2021 #atclassof2021 #atnobo2021 #getoutside #getoutside #kellyhayshikes #withguthooks #trektheat #atnobo #whiteblaze #georgiatomaine"

It was a beautiful summer day on trail. I enjoyed chicken nuggets and hot mustard for breakfast at yet another beautiful overlook. Pennsylvania really is a beautiful state on the AT, even though it gets a lot of crap for all the rocks. Around lunch time we hiked to a swimming hole a little bit off trail. Everyone took turns jumping off the rope swing into the freezing cold water. We had a group of around 15 people hang out for a couple hours at this spring fed pool. I jumped in a few times and dried off in the warm sun as I ate my lunch. After some falls, rolled ankles and getting attacked by some bees (& getting stung for the first time on trail.) we decided to cut the day a few miles short and stealth camp in the woods. We found an awesome little spot by a creek with a fire ring and roasted pepperonis for dinner.

The day started with a trip to McDonalds where I packed out 40 chicken nuggets and a couple McChickens. McDonald‚Äôs food packs out great and was a great resupply throughout PA. Next we walked to Dollar General to finish resupplying. There, it started raining and we took cover in the store until it stopped. Inside, we met a nice local named Anthony. Driving a sterotypical white van, he offered us a hitch back to the trail, which we kindly accepted. The trail is kinda funny, you end up doing everything you were taught not to do in normal life. Including jumping in the back of a strangers white van. Anthony turned out to be super cool and was yet another hitching experience I will never forget. Back on trail we hiked a chill 13 miles to a beautiful viewpoint where we decided to cowboy camp. This was my first cowboy camping experience on trail. For those of you not familiar, cowboy camping is when you just lay your sleeping pad on the ground and sleep under the stars -no tent or shelter. It turned out to be a beautiful night with a sky full of stars and a full moon! Our  little tramily cuddle puddled together under the night sky and watched a movie as the city lights twinkled in front of us. & even though it was prolly the worst nights sleep on trail, I‚Äôm still glad we did it lol<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>#appalachiantrail2021 #ATthruhike #thruhikingwomen #backpacking #hiking #camping #traillife #at2021 #atclassof2021 #atnobo2021 #getoutside #getoutside #kellyhayshikes #withguthooks #trektheat #atnobo #whiteblaze #georgiatomaine"

We only had 4 miles into the next town, and we were all in consensus to Nero there. The day started with hiking through a beaver bog. The first of many to come. I managed to make it through without getting my feet completely soaked, even though my socks and shoes were still wet from the day before. We spent the short 4 mile trek dreaming of what we would eat in town and all decided Arby‚Äôs was the move. Four miles led us to a road and we all hung out under a bridge until We figured out how to get into town. While we waited, we spotted some trout in the creek. Toasty had some fishing line and rigged up a pole, but didn‚Äôt have enough time to catch one before Moss found us a hitch. Somehow we managed to fit 7 people (6 hikers with full packs) into a Kia Soul. Our kind hitch had never shuttled hikers before, and she seemed to be thoroughly amused and a bit horrified  by our smell.

This makes it hard to really believe anything anyone says about anything out here. Imagine that! <br><br>I knew it would be hard, but I also knew I was ready.

River Fording. <br><br>Days one, two and three we were starting and ending the day with fords. This meant we started the day with wet shoes and ended the day with wet shoes. Everything was wet, all day and all night. Most nights it even rained for us so we couldn‚Äôt have a fire. Mother Nature was testing us. All we had to do was keep going north. So we did despite crossing rivers that were trying to stop us from doing so. Some were so deep up to my waist. It was scary and exciting all at once, yet we had no choice but to go forward. <br><br>#appalachiantrail #atnobo #appalachiantrail2021 #atnobo2021 #atclassof2021 #hikertrash #100milewilderness"

For months I have envisioned summiting Mt Katahdin, the northern terminus of the AT, reaching this sign and placing my hand upon it. I can‚Äôt begin to remember how many times that thought brought tears to my eyes and kept my legs moving. Ive lost a few toothbrushes, a spoon or two, a couple power banks, and maybe a few pounds, but I‚Äôve gained friends, experiences, memories, lessons and who knows what else that will stick with me even beyond this life. I become super overwhelmed with what to write when I sit still and try to convey the thoughts into a short caption from this epic chapter of my life. But for now I just want to say thank you. Thank you to those who followed along with my thru-hike, and took time out of your day to comment/message me, or give me words of encouragement. Even if I didn‚Äôt respond‚Ä¶those messages mean more than you will ever know and possibly pushed me that extra mile. Thank you to my friends I‚Äôve met along the way and to those that extended a helping hand. The AT community really is a thing of beauty. Thanks to my friends and family for checking in, sorry you had to worry about my well being. Thank you to my Mom and Dad who sent me whatever I asked for at the drop of a hat, they were always there for me when and if I needed anything. Thanks to one of my best friends Trey for driving my van almost 2k miles from good ole Bama to Maine and documenting my summit, he‚Äôs a true warrior. To jump on the AT without hiking for a few months and summit Katahdin is a feat in itself, but to climb most of it one handed with a full camera rig still blows my mind. I hope the hike didn‚Äôt kill you too bad. I‚Äôm excited to see what‚Äôs next, but for now, I‚Äôll be chasing the fall foliage in my van, slowly making my way from the Northeast back south.

It's pretty easy to get jaded by views with how much is behind you, but Maine feels very special. These are really the constant views you crave in a thru hike, and supposedly the last real challenge before summiting Katahdin as you go through the Saddlebacks and up the Horn. A couple of days we even woke up before first light to hike for sunrise views that didn't disappoint! And trust me, when sleep is at such a premium that is a hard feat to pull off. We've managed to hit some great camp spots that are well maintained thanks to the M.T.C. working hard to keep the trail in great shape. The leaves are changing colors and there's clear water all over. It feels like with all of our setbacks we landed in Maine at the perfect time!<br><br>One unfortunate part of this stretch is that both of us are sick. Our parents are following along with us for this final stretch, and my dad doesn't understand that you shouldn't cough/sneeze into your hand. Well, he passed his cold to us, and now we are both illin' our way down the trail. üòÇ It's so miserable! We felt like zombies as we still pushed 28.5 miles, 26 miles, then 24.5 miles while downing NyQuil/DayQuil whenever we could. We agreed that given the option we would both rather be in a bed somewhere, but we have our timeline and are stubborn as shit. <br><br>I'm posting this a couple days into the 100 Mile Wilderness. This is the last stretch before Katahdin, and is famous for having no resupply/towns for 100 miles. Sounds worse than it is, honestly. We've seen a lot of people slackpacking and getting picked up and shuttled back to Monson, so it's not really the promised wilderness I expected. Doobles and I just carried 5 days of food (including Katahdin) and are rifling through it to the finish. It's like the final test to see what you gained from the trail! üòÇ Complete with scary river crossings.

With mostly great weather, decent trail conditions, and views that just don't quit, I'm thankful we got to Maine when we did! I incorrectly thought the AT got easier after New Hampshire, but (go figure) I was totally wrong again; there are a lot of climbs, one after the next, and some very technical hiking. I mean, you are absolutely crawling on your hands and knees for some of it if you prefer not falling on your ass. But when you're up on a ridge hiking with 360¬∞ views, everything is just great! Even when the trail leads you back down the other side on sheer rock face. I can't imagine doing this stretch in the rain! Which did come through with one bad thunder storm, but we planned accordingly and timed it out with an early shelter stay by 4pm. We had both packed out Strawberitas and my Nintendo Switch was fully charged so camping early was fine!<br><br>Included in this section is the slowest, hardest, most fun mile on the whole triple crown for me. The Mahoosuc notch took us 1 1/2 hours to complete the mile, as you're choosing your own adventure through a long series of boulders. Climbing up, crawling under, jumping from rock to rock, it really was a blast figuring out how to navigate it all! Double Down's kryptonite has always been rock scrambling, and with these rocks being somewhat wet it wasn't easy for her, but she killed it! <br><br>Y'all know how siblings argue, and I'm glad Doobs and I hiked solo through the Wildcats right before this stretch. We needed the day break from each other, and that let us have fun together again! We've since hiked side by side every day since, and enjoying this victory lap together. She even protected me from an aggressive grouse!

One day you are put in one of those ocean pens, the big ones for orcas they want to try to rehabilitate and return to the wild. For the first time in your life, you‚Äôre in the ocean! You‚Äôre home and, while not completely free, you can sense how big and wild it is. You have room to move, room you never realized you lacked back in the tank. You live out there for five months, interacting with other orcas (also from Sea World) and other marine creatures. You can‚Äôt live fully free in the ocean because you would die out there; you have no idea how to survive totally on your own, but you can sense how vast it is, how amazing life would be if you were free. You feel so alive, no longer having to perform tricks for trainers and crammed in such a small, lifeless space.<br>Then, one day, you‚Äôre put back in the tank. And you suddenly realize that your entire life you‚Äôve been captive, trained to perform tricks in a small, crowded tank devoid of life except for other captive orcas. The other orcas ask you how your trip was, what it was like. You have no idea how to describe what you experienced and no idea how to tell them what you know now. To tell them there is so much more to life outside the tank, that they are unwitting prisoners unable to live full lives like wild orcas. You‚Äôre depressed, but they tell you to get used to being back in the tank, that this is the REAL world and that pen in the ocean was just something fun you did that one time.<br>But you know. You felt the tides, met incredible creatures, and were no longer controlled by trainers.

We conquered both Mt Washington and the Wildcats over the course of a couple crazy days, and while you can't control the weather, you can push through almost anything! Of course we had decent weather leading up to it, but while on Mt Washington wind gusts decided to bellow up to 80 mph (which holds the wind record in the US with 231 mph recorded.) We quickly hurried down but still had to push head on in the wind for most of the day above treeline. It hurt my eyes, chest, and changed my breathing, but everyone faces adversity out here. Some very  hard hiking that really brought me back to the CDT; in Colorado it felt like every day brought a battle or a trying experience, which is all worth it because that's what creates memories for me. The CDT's motto is ""Embrace the brutality"", and oh yes, this day in the Whites was brutal.  Some guy told us (unprompted) that we can't do more than 15 miles out here, and we're like, well today and tomorrow are both 20's. üòÇ But we did it! <br><br>The Wildcats brought high expectations of punishing climbs, but really it was only a few big inclines and the rest was mellow. A great lesson to sometimes take warnings with a grain of salt, or at the very least remember that you're capable and a positive mindset can make a world of difference! Unfortunately the views in this section didn't live up to the hype for me, but there were a couple great viewpoints. <br><br>All in all, I'm happy to be done with the White mountains. It was a lot of technical climbs and fun hiking, but the foreboding dread of getting to this stretch is past; now we can really focus on Katahdin!

The section we've heard so much about since Georgia, and the first three days lived up to the hype! Honestly, it wasn't as difficult as we had expected, but your body really is a well-oiled hiking machine after some 1700 miles... that or we've gotten a lot better at ignoring pain. Any chance to hike interesting terrain like these steep rock faces is a great change of pace from somewhat boring green tunnel. Give me the puzzle solving of how to get up and down without busting my ass! Very thankful for the good weather when you have it, because shit, we definitely had some bad weather! Mt Moosilauke gave us incredible clear views all day, but unfortunately Franconia Ridge was completely socked in with clouds and high winds. <br><br>The hardest part of the section is honestly the stupid hut system the AMC has put in place. Apparently The Whites have 7 million visitors per year, so a system has been put in place where you can only camp at designated huts/shelters along the path; unfortunately, they charge exorbitant fees (over $180 per night for a bunk bed) which is a total gatekeeping move. It really is an ugly system and there's got to be a better way to make this gorgeous area more accessible to people who aren't wealthy. Being that it's not in our budget, we have had to temper our miles to stay at the more affordable $10 camp spots (which fill up fast); this means we do less miles and camp earlier in the day. Not ideal, but grateful to finally be here! <br><br>Also, your boy forgot his puffy and has been freezing his üçë off at night! Sleepless nights are no fun, but at least my extra layers are dry! Hiking through wet winds are great for miles because you never want to take breaks, so at least we've got that going for us!<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#at2021 #appalachiantrail2021 #appalachiantrail #atnobo2021 #at #wearealladventurers #thruhike #thruhiking #backpackingadventures #hikingadventure #hikertrash #getoutside #getlost #wildeast #moosilauke #newhampshire #trektheat #georgiatomaine"

Tomorrow is the start of a few days that will be tricky to handle logistically.  I‚Äôm currently about 17 miles away from the Kennebec River where the AT crosses by way of a ferry (glorified canoe). The challenge is the number of expected hikers crossing during limited hours (9-2) and the ferry  can only handle two hikers at a time.  There is also the option of fording the river, which seems strongly discouraged due to varying water levels depending on when the dam is opened up.  The next day, I will be getting off the trail for a few days to attend a wedding in New Jersey, so one way or another, the river will have to be crossed to get to the road.

I was able to keep a pair of clothes dry and my sleeping bag, but basically everything else has been soaked all day.  As I‚Äôm carrying the noticeably heavier soaked pack today over mountains, I can tell that the weather isn‚Äôt going to let up and it sprinkles throughout the day and gets nasty on top of Saddleback Mountain and the ridge line.  Not to mention, the trail is basically all mud from the heavy rains.  Cold, wet, muddy and exhausted coming into camp is becoming the norm.  I mentally prepared myself for this before starting the trail and I knew what I was getting into when I told myself I would be walking from Georgia to Maine.

It's a lot of work before and during, but paying attention to details is a big part of a successful thru hike. At MountainBlaze, we too, put much thought, planning and attention to detail into everything we make, and we take great pride in this. All of our products are made or improved by hand, inspired by nature, constructed to last, and designed to be unique and inspiring.&nbsp;<br>This hipsack I'm working on now, for example, will be totally unique, even though it is a similar style as our other hipsacks. Slowfoot and I sat for a good amount of time just talking about fabrics, colors, themes, motifs, and features. We&nbsp;want all our products to be earthy, well-made, meaningful, beautiful and functional and this doesn't happen without careful thought.&nbsp;<br>This particular bag has not only a ""One Blaze AT a Time"" patch, but a hand drawn applique of Katahdin with an awesome sunrise print in the background. The fabrics and placement were chosen with much thought, and all the other features including pockets, daisy loops, zipper, webbing, clasps, lining, key clasp and extra stitching are designed to make your life easier.&nbsp;<br>The patch along with Katahdin on the front, is there to inspire hikers to just keep on hiking ""One Blaze AT a Time! The patch reminds us to take challenges, whether it be one mountain or one section or the entire AT, or even life in general, step by step, one small bit at a time. It reminds us to focus on small accomplishments and enjoy the small things along the way and don't let the enormity of the big picture throw you off course.<br><br>I think we can all use this advice, hikers or not!<br>#hipsack #fannypacksareback #fannypack #atnobo2021 #atsobo #atnobo #appalachianthruhike2021 #appalachiantrailthruhike #katahdinsummit #mountkatahdin #sunriseonkatahdin #katahdinmaine #katahdin #appalachiantrail #hikertrash2021 #hikertrash #oneblazeatatime #whiteblaze #ultralightbackpacking #hikingfannypack #customfanny"

The trail was muddy, rocky, root-y(?), and went from nice and soft and flat, to large flat boulders that were incredibly slick with no real way to stop yourself if you started sliding.  Mahoosuc Notch was the slowest mile of climbing/bouldering and maybe even a little spelunking that I‚Äôve ever done as it took all of about two hours to complete.  I even stepped in a bog today, where I sank to my knees in mud after watching countless others do the exact same thing.

Finally this trail is starting to open up a little and give some views! Of course that comes at the price of constant mud and mosquitos, but it's been cool to go from lakes, to outlooks, to rivers, to sobos coming into camp late and being super loud. üòÇ But I'll take it! Some highlights were Mt Greylock, which has the tower you see in the first photo; this beacon was built at the highest point in the state, as a war memorial to provide a guiding light home for our lost vets during WW1. That damn tropical storm Henri also forced us into some towns we may not have visited otherwise, so exploring those was great fun! Also gave a good excuse to post up in some hotel rooms, which presents its own challenges. Double Down and I really enjoyed the forced rest time, but we clearly had enough of each other as we hiked alone for a few days afterwards. üòÇ The mental and physical burnout is real after 6 months and 3400 miles of hiking.<br><br>The states really feel like they're flying by right now.

Lately I've been doing as many 20-25's as possible, which seems low, but is getting tougher as we encounter 5-6k elevation incline days (and those numbers only get worse). We are currently at the point where we only need to avg 17 miles per day to get to Katahdin by Sept 30th! That feels so great, as we worry about hitting weather that just isn't realistic to hike through for us. Anything could happen, but that's thru hiking!

I‚Äôve come to believe that Maine is only ponds and lakes, and lakes and ponds, with little rivers, streams and waterfalls in between. If there‚Äôs more to Maine I‚Äôd like to believe there isn‚Äôt because this life is all I need. I‚Äôd quickly be relocating myself to a small house on a lake here, but after a quick google search I learned I might need to Google how to get rich quick, first. <br><br>Anyway, our ferry man showed up right on time and scooted is across the water.  If you live in a town with actual ferries like I do, you might be imagining a small ship that you can drive your car onto, and a cafeteria where you can buy expensive burnt coffee. <br>But, this is not the case. Just a man and his canoe carrying us two by two back and forth across the Kennebec like Noah if he were on a budget. <br><br>From land to sea, then sea to air because we. were. FLYIN. <br>This part of Maine is flat flat flat and I could only be going faster if I were running. <br>Before I knew it I was in Monson, setting my tent up at @shawshikerhostel , purchasing my last resupply, and donning my last set of loaner clothes. <br>This is it, tomorrow I set off into the 100 mile wilderness, the last leg before the final summit. <br>It‚Äôs all so surreal. <br>I know there have been people following me on this journey, and I can‚Äôt help but think as I reach these last few iconic milestones if anyone‚Äôs thinking ‚ÄòShe‚Äôs doing it! She‚Äôs really doing it!‚Äô <br>Because I certainly am, thinking it I mean, but also doing it I suppose for that matter. <br>What a strange, but wonderful out of body experience it‚Äôs been to watch myself complete these final tasks.<br><br>Today is my dads birthday, and I‚Äôm happy I had service to call and wish him a happy one. Tonight I‚Äôm happy for a dad worth celebrating, who celebrates me, and for future celebrations together. <br><br>Onward. <br>#atnobo2021 #appalachiantrail #nofilter #appalachiantrail2021 #thruhike #sunset"

I really enjoyed my time in Stratton and I never wanted my little Food Network binge to end, but soon enough I‚Äôll be watching chopped from the comfort of my own bed and the only way to get there is to press on. <br>So press on I did, and this leg started off with The Bigelows, the last of the 4K climbs before the Big K. <br>As per usual, I stressed out a lot before the climb but I guess I‚Äôm finally getting the hang of it because before you know it I was to the top and the views were pretty spectacular.<br>There‚Äôs water everywhere in Maine, and it reminds me a lot of the northwest. It makes me want to never leave, while simultaneously making me so eager to be home. <br><br>After the Bigelows the trail has been pretty cruisy and we‚Äôve been able to put quite a few miles behind us. Eventually we reached the Kennebec River which can only be crossed by a ferry that runs from 9:00-2:00. We hiked 20 miles that day by 5pm which was amazing, but also left us stuck. We have been in such a rush that it was nice to take a moment to stop and smell the roses. So we set up camp early, ate dinner on the river, and even took a ride on a pontoon boat from some locals on a pond nearby. <br>It was a beautiful day, beautiful few days, and we went to bed right on the river planning to sleep in and wait for our ferry man the next morning. <br><br>#100happydays #day24 <br>#atnobo2021 #appalachianhikers #appalachiantrailclassof2021 #appalachiantrail #sober #wedorecover #atnobo #thruhiking #thruhike #womenwhothruhike #thruhikingwomen #thruhiker #odaat"

One of the first things I remember him saying: ""hey, is that a Nikon Z?"". From several feet away he noticed my camera, he's more of a video guy and I'm more still photography, but I was impressed and excited he recognized my camera and that we got to dork out a little about photography gear.  He even snapped a couple pictures of me on my camera, always a little strange being on the other side of the lens, but it was fun.  I assume his trail name is in reference to his tattoo (a meditating cat on his calf) and the fact that he wears pretty much all black.  I was also impressed that he hikes in sandals, some of those rocks (especially PA) must have been rough.

It was supposed to be a super easy day -flat terrain and pasture walking almost the entire way into Duncannon, PA. But if there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôve learned on this trail, it‚Äôs don‚Äôt count on anything being easy because the trail will find a way to make it difficult anyway. The trail was muddy and slick starting out, but man was it beautiful. For 14 miles, I walked through pastures and cornfields that reminded me of my grandparents farm in Illinois where I made some of the best memories of my childhood. It was a beautiful, awesome day and I was on cloud 9 all day. The second half of the day took me back in the woods with a small climb up and over a ridge into town. When I got to the top of the mountain, a storm started blowing in. The winds picked up and a huge branch fell like 5 feet from me. For the first time I was terrified on trail. It was raining so hard I couldn‚Äôt see more than a few feet in front of me. I hiked as fast as I could and was never more excited to see the road. From there I got lost looking for the church hostel and my phone didn‚Äôt work bc it was so wet. I ended up just standing under a pavilion for a while to see if the rain would chill but it actually was getting worse. It was basically a monsoon and the whole town was flooding. After walking around aimlessly for 20 minutes in the monsoon, a young guy and his girlfriend pulled up and asked if I needed a ride somewhere. I was a bit hesitant at first bc it was my first hitch alone, but I was so soaking wet and miserable I hopped right in and got the entire back seat of this nice persons Subaru completely drenched. The couple ended up dropping me off at a church hostel where I found a bunch of trail friends hiding out from the storm. That night we watched a movie on the projector, I finally got dry and got a good nights rest.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>#appalachiantrail2021 #ATthruhike #thruhikingwomen #backpacking #hiking #camping #traillife #at2021 #atclassof2021 #atnobo2021 #getoutside #getoutside #kellyhayshikes #withguthooks #trektheat #atnobo #whiteblaze #georgiatomaine"

I was so pleased when she said ""yes"". I often find that when I meet hikers at a location and there is a bit of a group (there were 6 hikers at this spot when we met) that I extra cherish the little bit of one-on-one time I get with each individual in front of my camera.  It's usually just a couple minutes, but I generally try to make it a bit of a conversation and not just posing for the camera, and I love this opportunity to have a chat.  Psyop took to the trail in GA on February 26th, intending on a traditional northbound thru-hike.  At some point into her hike she decided to make it more of a flip-flop and skipped up north some to give herself a better chance of making Katahdin before bad weather closes it (usually in early/mid October). When we met she had hiked over 700 miles of the trail, but she seemed maybe a little self-conscious about having to skip up.  I am so impressed and inspired by the hikers I meet, and I made it a point to reassure Psyop that what she has done and is doing is badass, impressive and something so few people ever even attempt.  Long distance hiking is a feat of both mental and physical strength and required a commitment and determination that I don't have.  So, Psyop, have a great rest of your hike and remember that you're awesome and an inspiration, and enjoy the heck out of your time on trail! <br><br>Photos by: @justin_goodhart_photography <br><br>#pawlingny #harlemvalley #appalachiantrail<br>. .<br>.<br>.<br>#makeportraits #pawlingny #hudsonvalley #photoshoot #makeportraitsnotwar #harlemvalleyatcommunity @harlemvalleyatcommunity @nynjtc @iloveny #upstateny @appalachiantrail  #trailmagic #humansofnewyork #dutchesscounty #environmentalportrait #neverstopexploring  #nikonnofilter #athiker #appalachiantrail2021 #appalachiantrailconservancy @appalachianmountainclub @appalachian.trail #athiker2021 #trektheat  #wildeast #hitthetrail #whiteblaze #atclassof2021 #appalachianhikers #appalachiantrailthruhike #atnobo2021 #nobo2021 #2021thruhike #hikehappy"

Day 126: Hiked 19.5 miles from Kelley Stand Road to Bromley Shelter.  Tough week, but returned to the trail to finish what I started.  Although I didn‚Äôt have as close of a relationship with my mom as I would have liked, I found myself remembering the positives this week rather than the negatives.  My fondest memory of her growing up was when she would come to pick up me and my brother, I always knew she would bring along candy or toys.  As we got older (even into our 30‚Äôs), those gifts we received when we were children never really changed and we would receive hot wheels, stuffed animals and candy along with a couple of dollars that she could scrape up for us for Christmas and birthdays.  The gifts seemed strange as we got older, but I think she held onto the times when our relationship with her was more positive and our bond was the strongest.  She never wanted to let that go. As everyone grew older and changed, she wanted to retain and remember the relationship we all once had with her.  This was a memory I would have shared at her funeral had I been able to compose myself.  The rest of this hike will be completed with her on my mind. <br><br>Ramen packets eaten: 45<br>Bear count: 1<br>Avg. miles per day: 13.14<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#atclass2021 #thruhike #appalachiantrail #appalachiantrailthruhikers #atnobo2021 #atthruhike #georgiatomaine #whiteblaze #hikertrash #guthookguides"

I just have to deal with it and cry if I have to / yell at people to leash their dogs. The calluses on my feet started to peel off so I cut them off üòÇ. I drank coffee from an AMC mug to remind me that I need to finish what I started. I hung out with 2 tabby cats and an older, friendly dog. I saw images of people at concerts and the masses of people in an indoor space while the delta variant is out there gives me immense anxiety. I played an AT board game with my nephew.

It was a beautiful day of hiking. I started to notice the terrain and vegetation change, it was like nothing I had seen yet on trail. I hiked alone all day. I was completely solo as Mighty Mouse had left for the wedding and my other friends I hiked out with out of Harpers Ferry took a zero. I ended up leaving the church hostel late and didn‚Äôt get on trail till around noon so I planned an easy 15 mile day. I ended up getting to the shelter super early compared to usual at around 4:30. As soon as I got there it started raining. I took a bath in the river and then took shelter in my tent. As I was eating my dinner, a man knocked on my tent door and handed me an ice cold Gatorade and PBR! Trail magic delivered to my tent! I got out and talked to him for a while and then noticed some people hanging at the shelter. I decided to go up and be social. Little did I know i at the time, but those people would end up becoming my tramily for the next hundreds of miles.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>#appalachiantrail2021 #ATthruhike #thruhikingwomen #backpacking #hiking #camping #traillife #at2021 #atclassof2021 #atnobo2021 #getoutside #getoutside #kellyhayshikes #withguthooks #trektheat #atnobo #whiteblaze #georgiatomaine"

Flagg Mountain is sometimes referred to as the southernmost Appalachian peak, and Potholder started there taking the Pinhoti Trail to Alabama and eventually connecting to the AT. We met when he passed though NY a few weeks ago.  Potholder is a musician and songwriter, carrying a small travel guitar strapped to his pack, and we had the pleasure of him performing for us.  Before he set back off on his NOBO hike he played ""Walker of Mountains"" for us, a love song to the Appalachian Trail.  It is one of those experiences from meeting hikers that I will never forget.

I have never before put this much time and energy into a single goal, and for that reason, I consider my thru hike of the Appalachian Trail to be the greatest achievement of my life so far. There were days when all I wanted to do was quit and go home, but these days are what made the good days even better. On this journey, I met some of the kindest, most genuine people I have ever met. Saying goodbye to my trail family was definitely the hardest part of the whole hike. I will forever remember this life changing experience, and I look forward to seeking out new adventures in the future. <br><br>I apologize to all of the people who were following my journey for not posting for the last 3 weeks of my hike. I decided that I would enjoy the last part of my journey the most if I spent all of my time living in the moment instead of creating Instagram content.

It was an easy day of hiking starting out with a beautiful view above the clouds. The day was another burner with temps in the upper 90s. I had 24 miles on the menu to get to a church hostel in Fayetteville, PA, where I had a few packages waiting on me. The terrain was pretty easy but the heat and bugs really took a toll on me as the day went on. I stopped for lunch at a pavilion to dry out my gear that got soaked the night before. After some pep talking myself, I left the lunch spot with 10 miles left. The reward at the end was a restaurant right off trail that had burgers and milkshakes. After looking at the menu and dreaming of my order, I had exactly 3.5 miles to go to get there and only about an hour and half before they closed. At that point, I kicked it into high gear and literally was running down and around mountain and boulders to get there in time. I made it to the road in perfect time and was excited I had just completed my 24 mile day. I got to the restaurant to find that they were randomly closed till tomorrow. Sadness overcame me and I sobbed outside as I stood outside the door. Nothing is more crushing to a hungry thru hiker who just hiked a 20+ mile day in the scorching heat. I collected my life and pouted to the church hostel. Luckily, Pastor saved me a dinner plate, which I was so so grateful for. I got my packages and had a wonderful nights sleep.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>#appalachiantrail2021 #ATthruhike #thruhikingwomen #backpacking #hiking #camping #traillife #at2021 #atclassof2021 #atnobo2021 #getoutside #getoutside #kellyhayshikes #withguthooks #trektheat #atnobo #whiteblaze #georgiatomaine"

Howdy, New Jersey! Over 1300 miles in, and excited to leave the state of high humidity and huge rocks. That's sort of an exaggeration; while the trail has truly been brutal on the feet with all of the rocks covering the trail and a god awful heatwave, I think PA gets a really bad rap from the community. I've heard nothing but horror stories from people warning us how hard it was going to be, when really it's some mellow hiking. For the first time all trail, you climb a mountain and stay up on the ridge instead of a constant rollercoaster! This has made for some really fantastic days of chill hiking, making 25 miles feel like 15 in some other states.<br><br>We are definitely catching up to other hikers, too! We know we are way behind from Doobles taking the time off for her injury, but we are now finding ourselves near other hikers again which is exciting! I don't have to focus all of my social energy on @staywild_pnw which must be a blessing. Some cool highlights of the section was combining a Crunchwrap and a Big Mac, sleeping behind a bar, sleeping on a church's lawn, drinking water that looked like urine, and catching a bunch of newts.

I have made fantastic friends and even more fantastic memories with them. The bad days are really tough but every day I get to wake up and hike through miles of gorgeous forests and sleep under that stars at night, and I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs too bad!<br><br>1572/2193 miles<br><br>#appalachiantrail #atnobo2021 #atthruhike2021 #atclassof2021 #appalachianhikers #mosquitossuck"

I‚Äôm not cool enough to call it that but I tried. The Shenandoah National Park is a place that most hikers describe as smooth hiking so I was excited for a small break as I eased back into the trail. While I wouldn‚Äôt describe the hiking as easy, the grade of the trail was more forgiving than many other sections of the AT. The park‚Äôs Waysides spoiled us with outlets, snacks, cold drinks, and potable water. On a particularly rough day for me, Smackdown and I dialed back the mileage and indulged in drinks and dinner at one of the fancier places within the park. We hunkered down in the corner and made small talk with the bartender. At the end of our meal he gifted us with the $10 blackberry ice cream pie that we had been obsessively talking about AND the woman the next table over paid for our entire check. We were overwhelmed with gratitude. <br>Trying to get my hiker legs back has been more than a physical challenge for me. I wake up early every morning and leave camp hours before Smackdown does. I have to monitor my own breaks because I can‚Äôt push my body over a certain mph. I watch him fly down and up the trail with ease and I remember when I could do the same. My hip muscles are still awkwardly tight and are trying to adjust to being used like this again. I have to be so patient with what my body can do and how it moves. Things are fine and the way I structure my days is with my own health in mind, but it‚Äôs just so demoralizing sometimes to try so hard and still be so uncomfortable. This is just another hurdle that I will overcome‚Ä¶I just hope it happens sooner than later.

As we've moved on into Pennsylvania, the trail had taken a bizarre turn; we had one day of pretty countryside, and everything else has been green tunnel with a painful rock carpet. Not ideal hiking, but we have been having fun seeing all the wildlife and completing hiking challenges.<br><br>Y'all already know about the 4 state challenge, but how about the half gallon ice cream challenge? In Pine Grove, PA, you're tasked with eating a half gallon in under an hour, and we did it! We started at 9am which just added to the challenge, but I still finished in just 43 minutes. It was sort of a boost as I farted constantly for the rest of the day, literally propelling me forward. <br><br>In this stretch we went through quite a few cute towns. Even when the trail is insanely boring, the towns and people are what really makes it. We went through Boiling Springs, which had a beautiful lake area with ducks and geese. We met another hiker named Happy Feet, and explored the town of Duncannon with her, making friends with an older lady who was drunk at 2pm talking about trouser snakes. I'm telling you, I have a lifetime worth of memories and then some!<br><br>By the time you hear from me next, we should be in New Jersey! We have finished 6 out of 13 states and Double Down is really getting her trail legs back. We have comfortably been doing 25 miles again, which is huge for her with her hip issues.

If you don‚Äôt already know, I am an extremely sweaty person so this humidity hit me extra hard.<br>ü•µ<br>I wrote my confessions down at the Priest Shelter, I stopped a lot to try and catch my breath up climbs, and I quickly understood that hydration was priority number one. <br>After 3 days of hiking I happily hobbled into Waynesboro and we had a really great stay at Stanimals hiker hostel. Because of the time of year there aren‚Äôt too many hikers around - meaning we had most of the hostel to ourselves!

The views were a delight anyway, the same cannot exactly be said for the hiking. <br>I feel like we use the word ‚Äòclimb‚Äô as a general term for when we are going up, but today it was used in a much more literal sense. Many times throughout the day I had to ditch the sticks in order to use both hands to shift myself up steep rock faces. I was surprised to find that I actually kind of enjoyed the new challenge and it felt like I was really in it. The descent however continues to be my downfall. There was no pun intended there, but may as well have been because most times the descent is where I actually do‚Äî well, fall down. <br>But, not today! <br><br>So, after a long, difficult, annoying but fall free climb down we went into Lincoln for a resupply. <br>We had lunch at McDonald‚Äôs and we made a game time decision based on weather to stay in town for the night.<br>Turns out the only problems were that A) Lincoln, NH is very expensive and B) it was also all booked up for the weekend. <br>So there we sat outside the Price Chopper with our heads in our hands when Odie, our knight in shining school bus swept in to save the day. <br>When I first ran into him in the parking lot, he was sure he could find me a place to stay before I mentioned ‚Äòoh by the way, there are 7 of us.‚Äô But he pulled some trail angel strings and before you know it he had found us some tenting at the otherwise full @notchhostel . <br>Serena is a wonderful host and Odie just a wonderful guy and they really came together to make sure we had a fantastic place to stay and weather out some rain. <br>Just one more illustration of how the trail will provide. <br><br>So tonight, I am happy for a belly full of Chinese food, cell phone service to watch my trashy tv show, and that I didn‚Äôt have to hike the 2 and a half miles up to The Franconia Ridge.

He had lived in NY for a bit before hiking the trail, and shortly after we took these pictures he hopped the Metro-North train to NYC to visit a friend.  There are a good amount of hikers who visit NYC as it's quite accessible with the train from Pawling.  I imagine it's got to be shock at times going from the trail to the city.

He also joked about his Walmart ""hiking"" shirt, and how it was a bit of a sweat sponge.  He took to the trail in GA on March 19th for his NOBO hike, and he met TP that day (his portraits are up next) and they were still hiking buddies.

My knees and hips are slowly starting to work again, albeit with continued stiffness and soreness. I‚Äôve seen many friends and coworkers after returning to my hometown of Durham, NC this past Sunday night. So many of them, of course with good intentions, have greeted me with a new nickname: Mountain man. I guess it‚Äôs the beard (planning to shave it soon) but mainly I think it‚Äôs that people who haven‚Äôt thru hiked honestly just don‚Äôt know that the mountains aren‚Äôt the only part of the trip. When I think of a mountain man, tops on that list is Nick Grindstaff; if you‚Äôve hiked the AT in Virginia perhaps you know what I‚Äôm talking about. But I‚Äôm not really a hermit. I loved the people I met while hiking. They were the best part of my experience. Being called mountain man doesn‚Äôt make me mad, but it certainly doesn‚Äôt accurately portray what, at this point, I think I‚Äôm taking away from the trail. <br>‚Ä¢<br>Club and school soccer have restarted this week and they are both going well. I‚Äôm pleased to be back on the field and enjoying my time with the players. I was texting one of my tramilies today and said, ‚ÄúI feel like I have one foot back in my old life and one still on the trail.‚Äù It‚Äôs an odd feeling for sure but I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôll be able to move beyond that. For now, however, I am surprised how much I already miss the trail and its routines, despite all the physical pain I was experiencing near the end of my trip. <br>‚Ä¢<br>FWIW, I signed the book at Amicalola Falls State Park as NOBO hiker 91 for the season and finished at Katahdin as hiker 169. Yeah, I‚Äôm a slow hiker. But someone has to take the time to stop and smell the wildflowers and enjoy all that beauty!<br><br>#atclassof2021 #thruhiker #goldiewalks #appalachiantrail #appalachiantrail2021 #atnobo #atnobo2021 #GA2ME #GAME #georgiatomaine #thruhike #trektheat #whiteblaze #backpacking #hikertrash #thruhiking #optoutside #leavenotrace #seeksimplicity #nature #hiking #adventure #findyourownpath #notallwhowanderarelost"

I always try to keep it fun and positive, but it just wasn't happening. The day was a test for sure.<br><br>Finally reaching our goal and seeing the Mason/Dixon sign after the day we had, made it so much sweeter. We are way behind the bubble, many have already finished the hike, so I've seen the photo of this sign so many times. The destination wasn't spectacular, but the feeling of sitting down and soaking in this experience was. This was truly a day I'll never forget! Trail is halfway done, now it's time to finish her off.

(That‚Äôs a bad joke, about a bad joke, about the fact that once again‚Äî it‚Äôs raining.) <br>With this in mind, we rose early, hiked fast, and break-ed scarcely in yet another race against the rain. <br>14 difficult miles by 2 pm and we beat the storm. <br>Not only did we manage to stay dry but we reached the cabin in time to climb the cat walk to the roof where we could see miles ahead to the mountains we have yet to climb, and behind to the ones we‚Äôve already conquered. <br><br>Now, it‚Äôs raining and I am warm in my bag in a cabin in the woods listening to the rain on the roof and feeling the warmth of the fire on my face. <br><br>This mysterious little cabin that sits in the woods is not a an official AT shelter but actually a gift for us hikers that sits in private property that we are so generously allowed to shelter in while we wait out this storm. <br>We will leave it tomorrow, and new hikers will come and we‚Äôll never know who owns it or get to thank them for sheltering us from the rain. <br><br>Today I am happy for the trail community. <br>This community is not made up only of hikers but also‚Äîso importantly‚Äî of people who just want to help us succeed. <br>Forever thankful for all those who give us food, hitches, advice, encouragement, and warm cozy cabins to help us out along the way. <br><br>#100happydays #atnobo2021 #appalachiantrail #appalachiantrail2021 #thruhike"

Started the day hiking in Virginia and ended in Pennsylvania! Couldn't be more excited to check this challenge off the list! It was 44 miles, 7.3k ft gain/7.4k descent, and what ended up being nearly 19 hours of hiking with all of the breaks we took (or naps for some of us). What feels so great is @staywild_pnw and I have always planned on doing this, but with our current injuries weren't sure it was possible; with my ankle still swollen from that wasp sting, and her hip/knees/feet/chafe recon/brain, we were ready to try but bail if needed. While towards the later part of the day we were definitely hurting, we pushed on and it really means a lot emotionally to know we both battled.<br><br>Maybe I was a little cocky going in. We've both done 53 mile days on the CDT and PCT before, but I really didn't take into consideration the technical aspects of this section. First getting through a spiderweb covered trail in the dark.ü§Æ And the last 7 miles of trail were covered with jagged rocks that just eat your feet up! Combining that with the steep ups, downs, and swarms of bugs, really brought our pace to a crawl as the exhaustion caught up with is. It was funny because we hiked side by side all day, joking and having fun, but then the last 7 miles were dead quiet as we both just shut up and had to focus. üòÇ I tried to get Double Down to make up some Mad Libs with me but it wasn't happening. I always try to keep it fun and positive, but it just wasn't happening. The day was a test for sure.<br><br>Finally reaching our goal and seeing the Mason/Dixon sign after the day we had, made it so much sweeter. We are way behind the bubble, many have already finished the hike, so I've seen the photo of this sign so many times. The destination wasn't spectacular, but the feeling of sitting down and soaking in this experience was. This was truly a day I'll never forget! Trail is halfway done, now it's time to finish her off.

He told me to do the 32 mile Pemigewasset Loop. That was the first time I met a thruhiker at the end of the ridge. He was also one of the first BIPOC hikers I had seen that day. He told me and Ben to wait 30 minutes before getting off the Franconia Ridge. He said the sky would clear. We waited like 2 minutes and kept hiking. We had a lightning storm that night. We didn‚Äôt see any of the views while on the Franconia Ridge. I didn‚Äôt realize this guy was a thruhiker until last year when I googled the Appalachian Trail. I had always thought it was another 30 mile route. <br><br>Some days ago I stood at that same spot. I am the thruhiker now standing at the same spot where that guy once stood. New Hampshire is such a special place. I am happy that I get to share these moments with my tramily. I got to the Franconia Ridge first in excitement for the views. I cried by myself on top of Little Haystack Mountain. I could finally see EVERYTHING. I was not in a cloud like I was 2 years ago with a 30 pound Gregory pack (third photo).

For about 100 miles, the AT follows the start of the Long Trail and we‚Äôve been joined by a whole new group of hikers.

SUMMIT DAY! AT mm 2187.8 to 2193.1, 5.3 miles. Unfortunately had to walk the same distance back down Katahdin...!<br>‚Ä¢<br>Alarms were set for 3:30 am, not that we needed help to wake up in the dark to summit. We left the Birches and were hiking before 5am. The weather forecast called for scattered thunderstorms. Of course right when we were in a section of essentially rock climbing, above tree line and totally exposed, a storm raced through. We hid in whatever hollows and fissures we could find, donned rain gear and crossed our fingers that we wouldn‚Äôt be struck by lightning or have to sit for too long. I‚Äôve done a lot of outdoor stuff in my life, but willingly hiking up Katahdin after 20 minutes of sitting in the rain, because I was getting cold while the storm lingered, was probably the dumbest thing I‚Äôve ever done. But we survived and the storm passed. Once we got past The Gateway and started up the tableland area, we could see blue skies and the sun came out. It was totally surreal, amazing, beautiful, emotionally overwhelming and...<br>‚Ä¢<br>Summited with Sundance, Grumpy Cat, Skippy, Squirtle (who I hadn‚Äôt seen since Fontana!), Hatback, RainCatcher, Vikingman, Dirty Dan and two section hikers. I was really glad to summit with my crew of five but also RainCatcher, who I hiked with through PA, NJ, NY, CT and MA as well as Hatback, who I hiked with since Hot Springs. It was an amazing crew and amazing hike. Surprisingly, I didn‚Äôt cry at the summit. I did some on the way up and definitely did on the way down. At the end, Rudder was kind enough to take our photo in the back seat of Flaps‚Äôs truck as we left BSP, happy to be finished. <br>‚Ä¢<br>I‚Äôll put up one more post that addresses my gratitude for all aspects of this hike. My thank you list is massive. I‚Äôm so grateful to have had the chance to walk from Georgia to Maine!<br><br>#atclassof2021 #goldiewalks #appalachiantrail #appalachiantrail2021 #atnobo #atnobo2021 #GA2ME #GAME #georgiatomaine #thruhike #trektheat #whiteblaze #backpacking #hikertrash #thruhiking #optoutside #leavenotrace #seeksimplicity #nature #hiking #adventure #findyourownpath #notallwhowanderarelost <br><br>üìçWabanaki, Ab√©naquis, Penobscot"

Baxter is a highly regulated/permitted wilderness areas with lots of rules. To accommodate for the open-ended nature of a NOBO thru hike, BSP has a camping area called The Birches, two four-person shelters, a tent platform and several areas for tents and hammocks. BSP allows for a maximum of only 12 thru hikers at The Birches each night, so we wanted to get on the sign-up list as soon as Ranger Tim showed up in the morning. A couple of our friends, Hatback and Cool Enough, didn‚Äôt originally get a spot, which was a huge bummer. I couldn‚Äôt imagine walking from GA to have to delay summiting Katahdin by a day. Thankfully the rangers at BSP work with thru hikers; a cancellation at a site at Katahdin Stream campground went to a handful of folks, so we had a total of 17 staged in BSP on Sunday night to make an ascent of Katahdin on Monday. The weather was unfortunately not good. It started raining about 11am and rained on and off most of the afternoon and evening. Thankfully all I did was nap and sit in my quilt! I needed an easy afternoon after two 20s in a row prior to entering BSP. As we knew we would all be up very early at 3:30 am the next morning, everyone tried to fall asleep early to get some rest. Needless to say, nerves, excitement and anxiety got to some of us, so not everyone had a long and restful night‚Äôs sleep, yours truly included! Spirits were high that we would not have to deal with nasty weather in the morning for summit day...little did we know!<br><br>#goldiewalks #appalachiantrail #appalachiantrail2021 #atnobo #atnobo2021 #GA2ME #GAME #georgiatomaine #thruhike #trektheat #whiteblaze #backpacking #hikertrash #thruhiking #optoutside #leavenotrace #seeksimplicity #nature #hiking #adventure #findyourownpath #notallwhowanderarelost <br><br>üìçWabanaki, Ab√©naquis, Penobscot"

Although both days marked less elevation gain and loss than other parts of Maine, the hiking in the HMW is extremely technical as the trail is filled with many roots, wet rocks and mud. The end of each day had me super worn out, particularly after the second day heading into Abol Bridge. But a deadline is a deadline, so long days and a really sore body were par for the course. We held up at Abol Bridge so we could be near the front of the line to enter Baxter State Park the next day and be assured of a spot at The Birches, a site reserved only for NOBO hikers as a base camp area the day before NOBOs try to summit Katahdin. <br>‚Ä¢<br>The Hundred Mile Wilderness is really pretty. We had two days of nice weather (a rarity for Maine) and caught several views of Katahdin in the distance. Blueberries and beautiful lakes were abundant. I enjoyed the forest walk even though the mosquitoes were pretty horrendous. That‚Äôs what 100% deet is for! Full steam ahead despite how horrible that junk is for your body; it was all part of seeing the finish line that made us pretty apathetic to pain and annoying bugs. But again, it was beautiful. IF I ever come back to hike in Maine (that‚Äôs a big if), I‚Äôd like to walk this part of the HMW at a leisurely pace with lots of food and a fishing rod strapped to my pack. That would be a fun way to experience it.

It was a 100 mile stretch with 75 lookouts, all of which could be accessed with your vehicle on Skyline drive; they set a 35 mile speed limit with the intentions of people taking it slow and soaking it in. Of course that doesn't benefit me and my legs, but it's nice to see muggles out and comfortably enjoying the same nature spots that we are.

On day 4 I wrote an entry about my first trail ‚Äúrealization‚Äù. That despite my introversion and comfort with being solo, I am incredibly lonely. That was 100 days ago and it‚Äôs still<br>something that I think about regularly while I hike. I have a hard time connecting with others and maintaining those connections. Sometimes, when I meet new friends it feels uncomfortable and forced. For the most part, it hasn‚Äôt been so bad because I am comfortable being alone, and more often than not relieved to be. But until now I haven‚Äôt fully recognized the deep loneliness under the surface. The loneliness that has convinced me to settle for unfulfilling romantic relationships- not the right fit at their best, or emotionally abusive at their worst. The loneliness that has told me the same story for as long as I can remember- ‚Äúyou‚Äôre different, you‚Äôre an outsider, you just don‚Äôt belong‚Äù. Trail hasn‚Äôt fixed any of this, even with the strong sense of community on the AT. I feel the same lack of connection, the same unsettled feeling of being just a little bit ‚Äúoutside‚Äù the group, feeling different. It‚Äôs naive to think that simply walking this long path would solve my problems, but it‚Äôs brought them to light in a way that I otherwise could have ignored for many years to come. I don‚Äôt know why I feel this way, I don‚Äôt know why it seems like there is a pane of glass between me and other people, I don‚Äôt know why it makes me uncomfortable when someone is interested in my company. But I do know that this is something I need to explore and focus on, and something I need to understand and ‚Äúfix‚Äù to move forward with my life and be where I want to be. A lot of people come out here to heal, but the first step in healing is to truly see your wounds.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#thruhike #thruhiking #thruhiker #thruhikingwomen #atclassof2021 #appalachiantrail #appalachiantrail2021 #georgiatomaine #atnobo2021 #optoutside #womenwhoexplore #hiking #backpacking #longdistancehiking #wheregalswander #trektheat #withguthook #hikertrash"

Pretty damn rad!<br>....<br>So as far as the trail goes, it's super apparent I'm back on the AT.

And it's hot as hell with this humidity that makes me sweat through all of my clothes. I don't understand when I see day hikers out in this! I would 100% be inside if I didn't have the goal of making it to Maine. We just need to barrel through this to get up north where we really start some climbing! A bonus of this restart is that the bubble is a few weeks ahead of us, so the trail experience won't be as crowded. I did really enjoy the Priest shelter; they keep a log where hikers can confess their sins. I admitted to once surface pooping when I just couldn't hold it any longer. üôà I feel like it's happened to everyone!<br>....<br>We're now headed into Shenandoah National Park, which promises some good views and cool experiences!

I got caught in a thunderstorm a few days ago and didn‚Äôt let my clothes dry properly. My socks still smell after four scrubs with detergent, so I had to elevate the wash. It feels weird being in a city. Everything is too nice, too perfect. The same feeling I had coming home after being on the @theworldrace. Everything I own smells and is covered in dirt, mud and tiny bits of leaves. I guess I live in the woods now. ‚ÄúHomelessness with intention,‚Äù they say. I have to search my messages every time I‚Äôm asked for my address, because I don‚Äôt have my parents address in Chattanooga memorized yet. Twice today, a homeless person has asked if I‚Äôm also homeless. I‚Äôve said no. But maybe the answer is technically yes. It‚Äôs a weird feeling. Caught in between two worlds. I‚Äôm not rugged or tough enough to stay on trail longer than a week or so at a time. But coming into a sparkling, bustling city also feels weird. For now, I‚Äôll rest and reflect for a few days and silently recommit to the trail. I understand now why people go home in Pennsylvania. I‚Äôve had a lot of friends leave trail and I‚Äôm praying that at least a few of them make it back. It‚Äôs not just the rocks here. It‚Äôs the heat (90+), the unpredictable popup thunderstorms, the thousands of gnats that dive bomb your face as you hike, the lack of water, and whatever other scenario a thru hiker is facing personally. Blisters, knee problems, pulled muscles, burnout. For me, it‚Äôs been a painful ovarian cyst, which is pretty common for women although most don‚Äôt talk about it. When I think about it, hiking to Maine seems like an absolutely crazy thing we‚Äôre doing. I heard that the man who first thought up the @appalachiantrail, Benton MacKaye, never dreamed anyone would try to hike the entire thing in one go - in fact, he called it a ‚Äústunt‚Äù that no one should try. Maybe what we are doing is crazy. I guess most dreams are. For now, I‚Äôm walking north. Closer to Maine now than Georgia.

Along the way I stopped at Big Meadows and enjoyed a cold beer and rest. 8 miles later I made it to Skyland resort. We checked into our cabin and found it had no air conditioning and only one window opened. At that point, we were better off sleeping in our tents. I went to the front desk to ask for a fan and the nice lady offered to let us move to a room with a/c at the same rate we paid for the cabin.

I wanted to fill every void in her pack with #trailmagic but of course she only wanted a few choice treats from my stash - two protein bars, nuts and a reusable zip top bag.

I ended my day early and got a space in the shelter. The mud before the rain was ankle deep and during the rain it got deeper. I was stepping through it all. The shelter is full of boy scouts (or maybe they‚Äôre just a large summer camp group?) and all Long Trail hikers. One of them said he wants to quit already on his day 1. I told him not to.

I cried my way through a few miles and decided I didn‚Äôt have anything left to give this day. Under 7 miles in, and we decided to just set up camp at the Loft Mountain Campground. This is a paid campground that is a popular spot for visitors of the Shenandoah‚Äôs to stay. While we were at the office about to pay for a spot, a trail friend walked up and offered to let us stay at his spot. He said a nice woman gave him her campsite for the night for free. As we talked more, we figured out the lady who gave him the campsite was the same lady and husband who had given us a ride to Waynesboro a couple days prior!!

Saw a border wall (SMH) by ERRE. And saw an exhibit of Jenny Hozer works that I had seen before in LA. It was years ago I read her work and I felt it. I read it every day.

The shower was cold, and someone needed to keep their hand on the knob to keep it turned on. But the six of us stripped down to our underwear, took turns hopping in and out, and got by with a little help from our friends. <br><br>Today I‚Äôm happy to be clean, or as clean as I could get in the time I could stand the cold water. <br>Zero tomorrow, time to rest. <br><br>#appalachianhikers #atnobo2021 #appalachiantrail #100happydays #day9 #gratitude #thruhikingwomen #womenwhothruhike #sober #wedorecover #odaat #newyork #trektheat #thetrek"

As for hiking, we planned to just walk as far as we could into the Shenandoah‚Äôs & dad would pick us up around 8 pm. It was another hot day, but the hike was easy & terrain was very chill compared to what we had been doing. We made it 20 miles & were done. We had done 100 miles in just 5 days & between the miles & the heat, my body was done. We finished around 7 pm, but then dad informed us he wasn‚Äôt going to make it till 10 pm or later bc he had to stay later at work. We decided to try our luck & see if we could get a hitch back to Waynesboro, which was around 45 minutes away. Low & behold, after only minutes of sticking a thumb out, a car pulls up with a Grateful Dead license plate. I knew right away we were in luck. @kehershey, Lily & Cooper picked us up & took us to the Loft Mountain campground where there were lots of day campers that could possibly take us all the way to town. Either way, it was a much better place to hang for 3 hours than the side of the road. Not only did Mrs. Karen shuttle us up there, she also gave us fresh fruit, hummus, & other goodies to snack on while we waited. We are blown away by her kindness.<br>We sat & waited a while until I went out to the parking lot to call my mom & fill her in on the situation. There, a nice couple overheard my conversation & offered to drive us all the way to our hotel in Waynesboro!!! When I told them I didn‚Äôt want them to have to go out of their way, they replied, ‚ÄúWe are retired & have nothing better to do!!‚Äù So these lovely humans drove us all the way back to the hotel and we shared many laughs and good conversations. As we walked in the hotel room around 9 pm, I couldn‚Äôt hardly believe we had made it there. I definitely went to sleep that night feeling very blessed and grateful that God was still looking out for me out here.

We didn‚Äôt end up leaving the place till around 3 pm. After trail running and only taking one break, we knocked out the 20 miles in only 6 hours. When we got to town, I called a shuttle and convinced him to take us through the Chick-fil-A drive thru. It was a perfect ending to the day.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>#appalachiantrail2021 #ATthruhike #thruhikingwomen #backpacking #hiking #camping #traillife #at2021 #atclassof2021 #atnobo2021 #getoutside #getoutside #kellyhayshikes #withguthooks #trektheat #atnobo #whiteblaze #georgiatomaine"

Which I‚Äôm gonna be honest‚Äî both are fantastic, but neither are probably that great as a daily ritual. <br>More recently I‚Äôve been trying to create a space each morning just for me, where I practice my morning gratitude meditation and set my goals for the day.<br>This morning was a particularly special one. <br>With no effort at all, I was awake before the sun, packed, eaten, caffeinated and ready to go. <br>With a carefully curated playlist in my earbuds, I set out just a touch before the rest of the gang, to catch the sunrise over a lake just a little ways off the trail. <br>With 22 miles on the agenda for the day, including a few fairly decent climbs, I treasured this moment of solitude, calm, and peace that I found on the this lake early this morning. <br>There won‚Äôt always be sunsets, and there won‚Äôt always be lakes, but I am convinced that there can be many more of these kinds of moments just as long as I‚Äôm willing to look for them. <br>Today I am thankful for the person I am becoming, how far I have come, and the things that I have already. <br>I am thankful for progress, not perfection and the pursuit of just that. <br><br>In other news, I climbed Bear Mountain, I crossed the Hudson River, I walked through a zoo, and I‚Äôve gone one more day without a shower. <br><br>#100happydays <br>#day7 #appalachianhikers #atnobo2021 #thetrek #trektheat #appalaciantrail #appalachaintrailclassof2021 #thruhike #thruhiker #thruhiking #thruhikingwomen #odaat #progressnotperfection #wedorecover #sunrise #gratitude #newyork"

Forgive my error in one of the videos saying the view was from West Baldpate; it was the second of the two we traversed which means it was East Baldpate. The Baldpates were a long climb but wow were the views worth it. East is a huge granite dome. Sadly my water bottle dropped out of my backpack and raced off down East Baldpate.

I hiked with Chef for the first couple miles. It was raining, but we stayed in high spirits because we passed the 500 miles to Katahdin sign. I hiked with Ben, Snack Meister, and Mock for the second half of the day. We chose to summit Killington even though the summit was surrounded by clouds. I passed the 1700 mile marker on the descent into Rutland. The whole tramily spent the night at the Yellow Deli Hostel. I was nervous about staying there because the hostel is run by the twelve tribes, but it was clean, dry and had free food, so I had no complaints. We were even invited to their evening ceremony before dinner. It was a combination of singing and dancing, which was very interesting to watch from an outside perspective. I would definitely recommend staying at the Yellow Deli to other thru hikers! <br>Day 127 (17 miles): I had breakfast at the Yellow Deli, then got a hitch back to trail by a LT hiker named Posh Jesus, who I had met a couple days before. A mile into the day, I reached the LT/AT junction. This meant that I was done with the Long Trail section of the AT that I had done the year before, and I would no longer be seeing LT hikers. A couple miles later, I received 4th of July trail magic in Gifford Woods State Park. I had a great time kicking back, eating food, and socializing with other hikers. Shortly after the trail magic, I took a quick swim in Kent Pond, then met the rest of my tramily at a 4th of July Festival that was a half mile away from trail. The festival was a great way to eat some real food and get into the 4th of July spirit. I hiked fast for the rest of the day to make up for all of the breaks I had taken. Even when I was in a rush, I was taken aback by the beauty of the Green Mountain Wilderness. I reached The Lookout Shelter at the end of the day, where I was greeted by a spectacular sunset and the return of my friend Moss Rock, who had been off trail for a month due to health concerns. Today was filled with many surprises and adventures, making it one of my favorite days on trail so far. <br>#appalachiantrail  #atnobo2021 #atclassof2021"

Crossed into Maine, the final state on trail (!!!) on Thursday and was immediately greeted with a punch in the face of even more steep, rugged and crazy climbs and descents. Had a packed house of NOBO and SOBO hikers at Full Goose shelter while the NOBOs all nervously considered hiking Mahoosuc Notch, aka the ‚Äúhardest mile on the AT, a giant boulder field at the bottom of a ravine, and Arm, the steepest climb on the AT, in the remnants of tropical storm Elsa on Friday.

I had hiked this exact day to Little Rock Pond when I hiked the Long Trail, so I chose to hike most of the day alone to reminisce on my past adventure. It was slightly overcast for most of the day, so the forest looked like a mountain jungle with moss the mushrooms on all of the trees. I took a quick swim in Griffith Lake, then took another swim at the end of the day when I reached Little Rock Pond. It started raining right as I finished swimming, so I spent the evening hanging out in the shelter with other AT and LT hikers. <br>Day 125 (16 miles): I had a lazy morning from the Little Rock Pond Shelter because I didn‚Äôt want to start hiking in the rain. I eventually accepted my wet reality and started the hike. Once again, the rain and fog made the green on the trees and moss even more vibrant than they are in the sun. We shelter hopped for most of the day, so we could escape from the rain during our breaks. The whole tramily was picked up at Kieffer Road by Mocks parent, then driven to his house where we had showers, a warm meals and beds.

All the emotions rushed through my body and the breeze felt so good at the top. I feel so grateful to be experiencing this thruhike. After coming down Bear Mountain (2,312 ft), I had more peaks to bag- yay! Also, I had reached the state of Massachusetts!! I bagged Mt. Race (2,361 ft), Mt. Everett (2,605 ft), Mt. Bushnell (1,824 ft)  and ended at a rocky ledge called Jug End where I could see Mount Greylock. It was very steep, slippery and the terrain reminded me a little of the 32 mile Pemigewasset Loop I did in the White Mountains in NH. It was like a super mini Whites in Massachusetts ha! When I reached flat ground there were a lot of mosquitos. I started to hear thunder and then lightning struck in front of me. I had experienced a lightning storm in the Whites before but this one felt closer. I sat under a big pine tree in the woods & checked the radar. It said it would pass by 4:15pm and 40 minutes later it died down a bit. After sitting in a puddle of rain & getting eaten by mosquitos I quickly hiked the 1.3 miles to the road & a kind woman turned around while I was on the phone with a hotel. I didn‚Äôt even have to put my thumb out to hitchhike. She told me it was about to pour again & as she opened her car the thunder returned.

Yesterday I was in a foul mood.  Multiple days of rain.  Kind of cold rain, too!  I slid off a plank and stepped into a muddy bog.  A grouse stood at the top of a rocky climb daring me to come by (we had a resolution‚Ä¶it all worked out!). I slipped and slid over rocks and roots and didn‚Äôt hike as far as planned.  At camp, though, the skies cleared and sour patch kids and good conversations helped my mood. üòÇ<br><br>And so it all worked out that today was beautiful and sunny.  The rocky descents dried and were easier to navigate.  I received a trail magic breakfast that I would not have had if I made my planned destination yesterday.  So it is all good.

I'm so excited to shove a half gallon of ice cream into my food hole and shit it out. Got my picture taken at the ATC I'm Harpers Ferry which was super neat-o! Harpers was a neat city too! Lots of civil war history and some really cool shops! It was kind of a fiasco trying to get to Harpers -_- was just running behind and couldn't focus, then got distracted by cold brewed coffee by some trail magic-ers which I then proceeded to pour all over myself just before I got to the ATC before they closed, hence why I'm shirtless in my picture because my shirt was dripping coffee. Also, my phone had died like 30 mins before I came into Harpers, so I didn't know where the ATC was nor was I able to actually snag a photo of my card in the ATC thru-hiker book. So I had a friend of a friend of a friend take a picture of my card and I was able to finally see it in the book! Which was super awesome!!! I'm really excited to be outta Virgina and I'm super excited to try to crank out some miles here soon! I should be hitting the 1100 very soon, and I can't wait to celebrate what I have accomplished so far. I can say though, people have kind of thinned out since starting. More often than not I'm only with a few others at shelters now, compared to the 30+ people I would see before the Smokies. I feel that now most of the people on the trail now are for sure finishing, unless taken out by either serious injury or some catastrophic nightmare at home. Thank you all for helping me out on this journey, it wouldn't be possible without it. If you want to throw me some bones for food or gear, I so appreciate it!

The deer flies were relentless and the heat was  brutal, so I was having a hard time staying motivated to do big miles. When I reached Dalton, I discovered that about half of my friends would be staying at a campsite in Cheshire that night. This meant that I would only have to hike another 9 miles to reach my friends. I got a large coffee at the gas station then ran the final stretch to Cheshire. It was beyond exciting to be reunited with some of my friends. I had enjoyed my solo adventure, but I was ready to be back with the group. <br>Day 119 (22 miles): We woke up at the Cheshire Campsite then had a quick breakfast at Dunkin Donuts. The hike began with the climb up Mt Greylock. I hiked most of the climb with some new hiker friends Labowski and Stash. We speed walked up the mountain, as we were surrounded by the first alpine vegetation we had seen since Roan Mountain in North Carolina. The view from the summit was spectacular. It felt like my first real mountain in ages. I ran down Greylock with Snack Meister, Labowski, and Stash, then I was driven to a resupply in Williamstown by Mock and his college friend James. When I returned to trail after the resupply, I was officially on trail I had already hiked on the Long Trail. It was very exciting to be back in Vermont. To add to this excitement, I also passed the 1600 mile marker! When I reached Seth Warner Shelter, I was reunited with the rest of my tramily.

I have something heavy weighing on my mind that has me in a bad mental space. This afternoon after we had dried out, the skies opened up with some claps of rolling thunder and we got drenched again. Totally soaked to the bone. And the cool breeze on the ridge gave a good chill. It should have been welcome after all this heat but I was just not in the mood. I usually love hiking in the rain, or at least don‚Äôt mind it. But today it just made me long to get off trail to a hotel. During the rainstorm Cosmos got ahead of me and I fell behind which made me feel so slow and weak. I‚Äôve found that any time a hiking partner goes in front they leave me in the dust no matter how hard I try to keep up. So much for these hot feet huh? This section of trail has been dragging.

I told myself I had to hike at least 12 and once I hit that I could choose to stay at that shelter Or push further. Those first 5 miles felt like 100. I dragged my feet and continued to complain in my head about every minor inconvenience i could think of. I pulled out my phone and the @newlifechurchtv devotion of the day was unopened. I pulled it up and the verse was Matthew 14 when Jesus walked on water. I prayed that I would keep my eyes on Jesus, prayed for strength and energy, and then I began to thank him for the day. Even though I was struggling, I thanked and praised God for the mere fact I was out here. & for all the blessings in my life. I ended up going 19 miles that day. My attitude shifted and, suddenly, so did my entire day, mood, and hike. <br>Some days you don‚Äôt want to hike, go to work, or even get out of bed.

Luckily, I was in a rush to get to town, so I barely took any breaks at all. I reached the Jacob‚Äôs Latter Trail Head in the afternoon and found a hitch into Lee.

When I arrived in Lee, I resupplied then tried to get a hitch back to the trail head. After hours of unsuccessfully trying to get a hitch, I scheduled a shuttle for the next morning and spent the night in a hotel. I tried my best to enjoy my last night in a bed.

We got soaked by a late pm storm and pushed to Galehead Hut, an @amcnewhampshire run facility that, lucky for us, had lots of open beds and could take us in. Ironically the hut was empty save four thru hikers who showed up asking for a place to sleep: Sundance, NoBad, Feral and me. Yes it was expensive but it included dinner and breakfast.

We were planning on hiking all 51 miles and 10,000 ft of elevation gain on the Connecticut section of the Appalachian Trail, in just one day. The first half of our day seemed to fly by. We were all running on adrenaline, so the constant climbs barely caught our notice. We were lucky enough to get food and gatorade brought to us by Ben‚Äôs Dad throughout the second half of the day. This helped us push through the mileage when we began reaching a state of exhaustion and delirium. The hardest stretch of the challenge was by far the last 5 miles, which included the rocky climb up Bear Mountain. When I reached the  Massachusetts border after only 18 hours and 20 minutes, I was overwhelmed with a feeling of accomplishment. We had essentially just run and ultramarathon! <br>Day 112 (0 miles): We had a relaxing zero in Great Barrington. In the evening, we were visited by the legendary trail angel Gravy Train (@i_need_mountains) who drove out of his way to bring me my lost wallet and hangout with us! He just started the Long Trail in Vermont, and has been posting great content! <br>Day 113 (21.5 miles): I started my hike around noon at the Massachusetts-Connecticut border. I was planning on leaving for Boston from Lee in 2 days, so I separated from my group and started cranking out big mileage. I absolutely loved my first day in Massachusetts! I had breathtaking views on Mt Race, Mount Everett, Mount Bushnell, and even more unnamed views. My only issues for the day were the abundance of bugs and the fact that my charging cord broke. Luckily, I ran into another thru hiker at the end of the day who was kind enough to let me use his charging cord and some of his bug spray. The kindness of strangers has saved me so many time on my thru hike so far! I finished my day around 10:00 pm at Thomas Leonard Shelter.

The major highlights of the day were McAfee Knob and Tinker Cliffs. I‚Äôd seen for years AT thru hikers take pictures at McAfee Knob, so it was surreal I actually made it here myself. I enjoyed a nice long break on top of the knob with some wonderful trail friends. From there I made my way to Tinker Cliffs where I had planned to watch the sunset. The sunset was a beautiful display of pink and golden clouds atop the beautiful Appalachian Mountains that spanned for miles. It even started sprinkling rain in true AT fashion.

I woke up moving slow. It was still raining and everything was soaking wet. I chilled in my tent and watched YouTube until I was good and ready to start hiking. I had two options for mileage this day - 14 miles to Four Pines Hostel, where I had a resupply package or 24 miles to a shelter. I opted for the 14 miles because I wanted to enjoy all the landmarks I would pass this day. From memorials, to overlooks, swimming holes and Dragons Tooth, it was an incredible day on trail. I took my time at each overlook and soaked in every minute of the hike.<br>This was also the day I hit the 700 mile mark on trail. This was a powerful moment for me, and the first time I felt like, ‚Äúwow, I‚Äôve actually covered some ground.‚Äù<br>A special moment happened right past the 700 mile mark. I passed by a group of ladies called the Mama Bears and we ended up chatting for a bit. I shared my story of the emergency surgery and gave all the glory to God for being able to come back out here.

It was such a powerful moment I will never forget.<br>At the end of the day, I was blessed with trail magic burgers/coke and then got a hitch to the Catawba grocery store (which was really just a gas station lol) There I got a second burger/coke and then got a hitch to Four Pines Hostel where a ton of my trail friends were also staying.

This morning's gradual climb led to a nice view that I would see throughout the day. On the way down from one particular view, I was prevented from running down like I usually do because there were many rocks. I shuffled down somewhere between a run and a walk. <br><br>My stride reminded me of my nana, Nora Burke, who would have a similar stride when she came to watch my siblings and I. She would come from two towns over and run/shuffle to our house when we were sick. She would go out of here way to stop at the bakery and purchase a loaf of Italian bread first. <br><br>I felt happy that my stride reminded me of my nana and felt connected to her.  And, the next moment, a section hiker crossed my path with two schnauzers. My nana used to have a pet schnauzer, Bubbles. It made me feel elated, and at the same time sad because I miss her in the flesh. But, she came to say hi and she is with me on my hike. And, my nana was extremely tough, had a lot of grit and was not afraid of hard work. Perhaps her stamina instilled and inspired me to be able to embark on this journey. Either way, I love you Nana.

We hiked a couple of miles along Arden Mountain, where there were many rocky views. We then got a ride from NY Route to a nearby town where we had breakfast at IHOP. After breakfast, we were driven to Geodudes house in Westchester, where we were able to relax for a couple of hours. Some of us chose to take the metro into the city for a couple of hours in the evening. There was quite a contrast between the chaotic city and the quiet forest that we had become accustom to. <br>Day 105 (0 miles): I took the metro back into the city in the morning and spent the entire day walking around Manhattan and exploring. <br>Day 106 (5 miles): We were dropped off on trail at noon. It was excited to be back in the woods after my time in the city, but I was beyond exhausted. The highlight of the day was definitely the Lemon Squeezer, which was a rock scramble with an extremely narrow passage way.

Although I was sad to be separated from the group, stopping early allowed me to finally catch up on sleep. <br>Day 107 (21 miles): I woke up early, planning on  catching up to my tramily by the end of the day. The trail continued to be gorgeous with more rocky views and grassy forests. To my dismay, it started pouring rain mid morning, so I took a short break at William Brien Memorial Shelter, where I was able to use another hikers power bank to charge my phone. Throughout the day I summited many small mountains, including Bear Mountain, which had an awesome observation tower. More memorable moments included passing the 1400 mile mark and hiking through the Bear Mountain Zoo, where I finally got to see my first Bear on trail (it might not actually count). I reached the Appalachian Market at the end of the day, where I bought some snacks and regrouped with my tramily. <br>#appalachiantrail #atnobo2021 #hikertrash #NYC"

Not 100% but much better.<br>‚Ä¢<br>GROSS ALERT/TRIGGER WARNING:<br>Don‚Äôt look at the last pic if you‚Äôre squeamish about seeing a syringe filled with synovial fluid that was extracted from my knee.

The last two days have been my most challenging on trail, but also among the most beautiful.  It is hard here!<br><br>A couple days ago I woke up after about 1 hour of sleep.  Back in Vermont I had a moment on trail where I distinctly felt the White Mountains from a distance.  That has happened a couple times on trail, and it felt like there was something to do there, though I wasn‚Äôt sure what.  During the day of hiking over Smart Mountain and Cube Mountain I was super emotional, crying most of the day with breaks to gasp and admire the beautiful views.  In the moment of quiet on the mountain, it struck me that the White Mountains were asking me to let go of some things I have been holding on to.  Not just mentally, but in an intentional way.  With the super moon coming up, it seems the perfect time to do that.  Knowing what the mountains are offering this opportunity and what I am to ‚Äúdo‚Äù brought a sense of peace and made it easier to hike on that day.<br><br>Yesterday, entering the Whites was amazing.  We climbed 3800 ft to reach the open summit of Moosilauke.  The top was open, windy, rugged, and beautiful.  And tough!  The descent was frustrating for me, though.  It was very slick on the wet rocks and steep enough on the rocks I was sitting on my butt and sliding and/or holding on to trees and rocks to descend safely.  The downhills are definitely my weakest area, and I felt very self-conscious about it.  I would rather climb all day!  But descending is a part of all of this, and I made it.  This was the first time I really doubted myself on the trail.  Things hurt,  I was tired, and I wondered for a while if I could really do this.  Can I hike the whole AT?  I was sitting on my butt in the middle of the trail.  I can do this.  Maybe it won‚Äôt be pretty, and maybe it won‚Äôt look the way I had thought.  But bring it on.  I am ready.

Zero miles walked!<br>‚Ä¢<br>Got picked up by my daughter Franny @franny9733 and her best friend Ellie @ellie.mcghee in Killington and drove back to one of my favorite spots in this world at the McGhee family @nedmcghee lake house on Swanzey Lake in NH. For my time off trail, I ate a ton, slept, played mini golf, ate lots of ice cream, swapped out some gear (yes, the White Claw is a joke), swam in the lake and generally spent lots of quality time with Franny, Ellie and Ned. The house is like a museum; it was built in 1917 (or ‚Äò18?), isn‚Äôt winterized and is a true vestige of the past when families retreated to summer lake cabins to escape the heat. Swanzey is such a cool place and Ned has always been so generous to allow my daughters and me to stay with them - thank you SO much for a great break from hiking!<br>‚Ä¢<br>I knew it was coming, but the return to trail after my time off was brutal. It was the most emotionally challenging thing I‚Äôve had to do on this trek so far. I‚Äôm tired, I hurt a ton, especially in my knees, and I feel like I‚Äôm doing all I can to muster the courage to push on for these last few states. After Franny and Ellie dropped me off to resume hiking, I kept up a good face until about 15 minutes into the hike, at which point I just started crying uncontrollably. Coming off zeros fills the thru hiker‚Äôs head with feelings of self-doubt, sadness, a desire to get off the ‚Äúpain train‚Äù and then, speaking from the I perspective, feelings of inadequacy and ‚Äúyou suck for wanting to quit.‚Äù It is the reality of a thru hike. Better to share and tell the truth than hide behind the veneer of social media. But, if you‚Äôve seen my story for today, I made it through Vermont and walked in to New Hampshire today.

When for no particular reason- no summit, no open bald or cliff side, no tourist destination- the trail becomes magical. It always happens really suddenly. You‚Äôre walking on an ordinary trail and then you take an unknowing step into another dimension. A field of tiny wildflowers. A moss-shrouded forest. A sea of ferns. The stretches of trail that make me stop dead in my tracks, my hiking partner crashing into me, for me to turn around and give them a Very Serious Look. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre seeing this right? How beautiful is this?‚Äù I always stop to take a bunch of photos and am always disappointed that they can‚Äôt capture the feeling well enough.

I met a woman first thing on trail that I hiked with until we parted ways at the woods hole turn off. We shared great conversations about life, the trail, and everything in between. She shared with me that in her 45 years of life, she had never done anything truly alone. This surprised me. While I am hiking this trail with friends most days, I am also solo my fair share as well. In addition to hiking solo, I also drove across the country twice on my own this past year, and lived in Cali by myself amongst other things. I think it is so important, especially as a woman, to do things alone and be independent. People will tell you it isn‚Äôt safe, you should go with someone else, etc. Go anyways. Do the things you want to do and don‚Äôt wait on anyone or anything. Obviously, be safe about it, but I will NEVER let fear of being alone hold me back from doing anything in this life.<br>Anyway, here is a photo dump from this magical place, hidden in the woods off trail called Woods Hole. This place had an energy and peace about it that can‚Äôt quite be put into words.

It was cold and rainy again, and I wasn‚Äôt really feeling another whole day of being wet and cold. I left camp with the intention of a 17 mile day, but that plan slowly faded as the day went on. Today I hiked through the section of trail that followed the Virginia Creeper Trail. Next was the White Top Mountain climb. It was long and hard. Around 2:00pm I realized I still had 12 miles to go & hadn‚Äôt seen Mighty Mouse all day. There was zero service in this stretch. A little later I got a satellite text from Mighty Mouse saying she stayed back at the last shelter because she was feeling sick. I was 8 miles from that shelter and still 5 miles from Thomas Knob, the shelter I had planned to camp. I decided to forgo climbing any higher in elevation due to the cold temperatures, rain and dense fog. Ended up camping just before the Elk Garden parking lot. I ate ramen and a rice crispy treat for dinner and went to sleep with 70% of my gear soaking wet. It rained all night and got down to the low 40s. I had just sent my pants home, but luckily I had my new quilt that kept me warm. My knee was swollen and I had blisters forming from hiking in wet socks/shoes for the past 2 days. I only had one choice this day/night: SUCK IT UP AND DEAL WITH IT! This day was all about embracing it the suck and remembering there are better days on the horizon, and that life could be way worse. It is truly such a blessing to be out here even on the hard days.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>#appalachiantrail #appalachiantrailthruhike #appalachiantrail2021 #ATthruhike #thruhikingwomen #backpacking #hiking #camping #traillife #at2021 #atclassof2021 #atnobo2021 #getoutside #hikerbabes #backpackingbabes #getoutside #kellyhayshikes"

I am as the first and only one there. I read the entire log book and leisurely set up my stuff. Stillness feels like such a luxury. I have become used to constant motion over the past two months. I am soothed by simply sitting and listening to the creek. After enjoying just being for a bit, ,I decided to make a fire. An owl soars over the creek and perches on a branch directly in front of me. Then he flies down to another branch and remains in sight for at least thirty minutes. I appreciate the owl sighting and take it as a gift for being still.

I called urgent care and was informed it would cost me $130 to walk through the door. Heck no. So I spent most of the morning trying to figure out what to do. Eventually I ran into @jbenhikes and crew, who tried to help me get the bug out with no luck. I accepted that this was my life now, a bug in my ear, living rent free. I tried my best to forget about the situation and enjoy the day. I didn‚Äôt get many pictures from this day bc I was too busy going mentally insane.<br>Surprisingly, the bug incident wasn‚Äôt the only horror left in store for me that day. With only 6 miles left, I lost my GoPro on trail. It fell out of my pocket and I hiked an extra 3 miles up and down a mountain looking for it. Thankfully, my friend Lucious found it, but only after I had a minor panic attack.<br>Thirteen hours later we finished the marathon and got back to the hostel. Mrs. Berty flushed my ear with a syringe, salt water, and tried to tweeze the bug out. Again no luck. At this point I was so tired I didn‚Äôt even care anymore. We celebrated finishing the day with a delicious, fresh baked chocolate cake. What a day it was!!<br>Last but not least, this was the day I officially accepted a trail name: 9 lives.

Vermont was stunning from start to finish.  The AT shared trail with the Vermont Long Trail from the MA state line to Killington before turning to the east towards NH.  We went from beautiful ponds, streams, views, and MUD to the deep stillness of spruce forests and fields full of tall grasses and wildflowers.  One of the most breathtakingly beautiful places I have been.  This morning I was smiling and laughing out loud as I walked into an open pasture with beautiful Mountain Views on the horizon.  Thank you, Vermont!<br><br>Now...NH.  The toughest terrain (the White Mountains, especially) we will see on the AT.

Self-acceptance is such a beautiful thing, and I think necessary, to hike this trail.  #2  An illusion that hiking this trail would lead to enlightenment.  But it is damn hard.  I heard this sitting in a pub after a tough day.  I was cramming chips into my mouth and enjoying an IPA, and all I could think was ‚ÄúI think this is enlightenment.‚Äù üòÇ. You really can‚Äôt be any place other than the one you are in out here, whether you are happy and smiling at a view or cursing at rocks and rain or because you‚Äôve stubbed your toe for the 800 millionth time.

It was beyond upsetting to part ways with someone I had become so close with. We hiked 3 miles to Gyp‚Äôs Tavern, where we had a big lunch. We were in a bit of a slump after lunch, so it was extremely hard to restart our hike with the climb up Culver Fire Tower.  It began raining, right as I was climbing up the firetower, so I was lucky enough to still get a bit of a view. It rained for the rest of the day, so I had to put my head down and push through the mileage. Near the end of the day, I stopped at an observation tower directed at the tallest point in New Jersey. We were able to get a glimpse of the high point, as the clouds blew over the mountain. We spent the night at High Point Shelter, where I fell asleep as soon as my head hit my sleeping pad. <br>Day 102 (24 miles): I woke up early with Giggles and Snack Meister and walked the 7 miles to Unionville, where we had breakfast sandwiches. We continued our hike in the scorching heat, taking breaks at every water source. The highlight of the day was walking along the Pochuck Boardwalk and stopping at Happy Hill Farm and Garden for ice cream. I remember being beyond exhausted as I struggled through the rocky climb up to Wawayanda Shelter. It was another night of restful sleep. <br>Day 103 (19 miles): I woke up, feeling tired from the last two days of hiking. I dragged for the first 10 miles to Bellvale Farm, trying my best to enjoy the New Jersey/New York border and the stunning views. After a sizable ice cream serving at Bellvale Farm, the group made a plan to camp at the Warwick Drive In Theater. This exciting plan gave me the motivation to hike another 9 miles. After a long day of hiking, we reached Orange Turnpike, where we got a ride to the theater and watched Cruella. I love the days like these where I end up going on an adventure I had no idea about when I first woke. <br>#appalachiantrail #atnobo2021 #atthruhike #hikertrash"

These moments just keep getting sweeter and sweeter.<br>It rained part of the day and I walked through grasses as tall as me. My pack was heavy from a fresh resupply filled with all sorts of produce & whole foods. The original plan was to stop in a hostel called Bear Garden that was right off the trail and then hike on to a campsite off the trail. There was hardly any service on this section of trail, and I desperately needed wifi to upload my videos. We got to Bear Garden and found a bunch of our friends staying there who participated in the ‚Äúmarathon challenge.‚Äù If you completed the marathon hike, Berty, one of the owners, baked everyone a cake. That was all I needed to hear to convince me to participate in the challenge the next day. I tented in the yard and hung out with trail friends the rest of the afternoon.

There were no water sources for the first 11 miles of the day, and the majority of the trail was extremely technical, with huge boulders. Despite the difficult terrain, we were overwhelmed by the beauty of the ferns that lined the trail and the frequent openings in the trees along the ridge lines. We ended our day with a gorgeous sunset view from Kirkridge Shelter. <br>Day 99 (6 miles): I woke up early with my visiting friends and hiked the 6 miles into Delaware Water Gap. The trail was flat and wasn‚Äôt rocky compared to the previous day. It was a nice way to end the state of Pennsylvania. When we reached Delaware Water Gap, I said goodbye to my friends and went tubing down the Delaware River with my tramily. Floating down the river was an awesome way to take some time off from hiking. It had always been something that I wanted to try. Once we had finished our tubing adventure, some of the tramily hiked a couple miles north, while I stayed the night in town with Snack Meister, Giggles, and Bender.

It was so hot and humid we were soaked climbing up and out of Dalton to drop back down to Cheshire right into more heat. Ate some town food and started our biggest climb since central VA up to Mt. Greylock, the highest point in MA. Dodged a thunderstorm the whole way up and found out the lodge had beer. Well of course we had to have a few and then the skies cleared and it turned into a gorgeous evening, so we hiked on a few more miles to the shelter where we all setup tents nearly in the dark.

Only 593.1 miles to the summit of Mt. Katahdin in ME! Prior to entering VT we hitched to the Moonlight Diner in Williamstown, ate a bunch of food, hitched back to the trail and started climbing up into VT. Vermont welcomed us with a beautiful day: sunny, breezy, cool and just a lovely walk. So green and so lush. We‚Äôre starting to pass lots of alpine bogs and I‚Äôm jonesing to see a moose. Fingers crossed. Today was gorgeous in so many ways. I can‚Äôt believe we‚Äôve walked to Vermont from Georgia! Camped at the shelter with the crew and met Jess, who just finished day one hiking NOBO on the Long Trail, which shares the footpath with the AT for 105 miles. Pretty cool.

It was cold and rainy again, and I wasn‚Äôt really feeling another whole day of being wet and cold. I left camp with the intention of a 17 mile day, but that plan slowly faded as the day went on. Today I hiked through the section of trail that followed the Virginia Creeper Trail. Next was the White Top Mountain climb. It was long and hard. Around 2:00pm I realized I still had 12 miles to go & hadn‚Äôt seen Mighty Mouse all day. There was zero service in this stretch. A little later I got a satellite text from Mighty Mouse saying she stayed back at the last shelter because she was feeling sick. I was 8 miles from that shelter and still 5 miles from Thomas Knob, the shelter I had planned to camp. I decided to forgo climbing any higher in elevation due to the cold temperatures, rain and dense fog. Ended up camping just before the Elk Garden parking lot. I ate ramen and a rice crispy treat for dinner and went to sleep with 70% of my gear soaking wet. It rained all night and got down to the low 40s. I had just sent my pants home, but luckily I had my new quilt that kept me warm. My knee was swollen and I had blisters forming from hiking in wet socks/shoes for the past 2 days. I only had one choice this day/night: SUCK IT UP AND DEAL WITH IT! This day was all about embracing it the suck and remembering there are better days on the horizon, and that life could be way worse. It is truly such a blessing to be out here even on the hard days.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>#appalachiantrail #appalachiantrailthruhike #appalachiantrail2021 #ATthruhike #thruhikingwomen #backpacking #hiking #camping #traillife #at2021 #atclassof2021 #atnobo2021 #getoutside #hikerbabes #backpackingbabes #getoutside #kellyhayshikes"

The morning hike was beautiful with vibrant green trees lining the trail. I took a long lunch break at Eckville Shelter with some of my tramily. This shelter was luxurious with power outlets, a running water source, and a shower. The afternoon was insanely rocky. I fell on the slippery rocks multiple times, but it was well worth it for the gorgeous views. I stopped at Dans Pulpit, Balance Rocks, Knifes Edge, and Bear Rocks. I reached a stealth site with some of my tramily as it got dark, but I chose to continue hiking another 2.5 miles through the dark to Bake Oven Knob Shelter, so that I could meet my friends who were visiting the next day. <br>Day 96 (12 miles): I woke up early from Bake Oven Knob Shelter, and hiked the 7 miles into Palmerton.

We had a big pizza lunch, then hit the trail. It began raining as we began the ascent out of town, which made the rocks very slippery. We spent the night at a stealth sight with the rest of my tramily, and had a dance part by a view as the rain stopped. It was very exciting to introduce my friends to life on trail. <br>Day 97 (12 miles): I had a slow paced day with my visiting friends, taking lots of breaks at all of the power line views. There were very few water sources along this section, so we had to rely on water caches left at roads by trail angels. It was supposed to rain for the entire day, so we were all relieved to make it through the day with less than an hour of rain. We spent the night near Leroy A Smith Shelter, where we tented and hung out in a grassy field. <br>#appalachiantrail #atthruhike2021 #atnobo2021 #rocksylvania #hikertrash"

The past week I have been pulling some 25-30 mile days and I started to hate my food ( mostly all protein bars) so I sort of stopped eating. They took me out to lunch & now I‚Äôm at this sweet shelter with a swing. I haven‚Äôt seen many thruhikers in the last week and those I‚Äôve seen don‚Äôt seem to want to talk or be friendly with me.

Damascus is a famous trail town along the AT. The trail literally comes off the woods and into the side of someone‚Äôs yard. You walk right through the entire town. I got there around dinner time, and met a local who told me I HAD to go eat at the diner. I headed there and had a delicious meal of grilled chicken, buffalo tots, and green beans. I had no plan of where I was going to stay that night. The original plan was to hike out and camp in the woods, but that was almost 2 more miles away and I was shot. As I was eating, I overheard a man walk up to the counter who was upset about guests cancelling last minute. I asked my waitress about it and turns out it was her dads B&B and there was a room open for us that night right down the street which included breakfast at the diner.

A dream of mine became a reality. I got my photo taken at the @appalachiantrail Conservancy in Harpers Ferry. I was there last year on a very cold day, contemplating if I would be able to do this & here I am. I finished the state of Virginia, finished West Virginia and made it into Maryland. <br><br>I‚Äôve never had too many opportunities growing up as an undocumented person. This is a big deal for me. When I get emotional on the trail, that is where it is coming from. Undocumented folks don‚Äôt have many opportunities in this country so we create our own & help each other out. I am happy that for once I created this opportunity for myself and for others to see what we can accomplish. I passed $5,000 of funds raised for @casa4all and I hope to continue to raise more for families in DC, Maryland, and Virginia. The link to donate is on my bio. <br><br>The support of others is super important on this thruhike and I want to thank you all again! THANK YOU üß°<br><br>To the companies that have supported me so far: @kulacloth for accepting me as an ambassador & believing in my journey when all other companies rejected me. To @allmans.right for the UL toothbrush and being super cool people & company. To @garagegrowngear for also sending me a UL toothbrush. To @arcteryxwashingtondc for outfitting me while I was in DC on memorial day weekend with a new rain shell & the shorts on this photo. I have so much airflow on my legs now. We need more companies to support BIPOC hikers & make affordable gear. <br><br>Also shoutout to the random people on Reddit for selling me their used gear. Most of my UL gear I bought used from other people and it‚Äôs been working out so far. I started with a 31L V2 from @palantepacks and switched to their white 37L Desert Pack once Time Crunch left the trail. I love them both so I had to hold it up on the photo to show you how light my pack is! <br><br>Now just need to get to Katahdin!<br><br>#appalachiantrail #at2021 #atclassof2021 #atnobo2021 #thruhike #whiteblazer #indigenouswomenhike #latinahiker #undocumented #thruhikingwomen #senderismo #unlikelyhikers #melaninbasecamp #withguthook #humanpoweredadventures #naturaleza #shewanders"

Yes, I did start on February 13, so before you question my math, I am not including the 10 days I spent off trail coaching club soccer in March as part of my total. <br>‚Ä¢<br>This 100th day was tough. I was in a rough spot early in the morning. I was worried about my feet and both knees hurt and are swollen. My head was in a bad spot. I‚Äôm thankful @frannie.cudahy, my support person at home, received my panic texts and just responded, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù It was what I needed to hear. Pulled my head out of my rear end, got rolling and enjoyed the walk into Falls Village, CT. It was like walking the greenways in Chapel Hill, like I did with my girls and their dogs a ton during Covid lockdown last spring. Good memories. Ate dinner at the @fallsvillageinn and then climbed 3ish miles up a steep mountain and made it to Limestone Spring shelter and had to walk a crazy .4 mile descent down to the shelter. Tricky to do in the dark. Met Rob, a mostly retired insurance specialist from Greensboro, NC (yes, someone who lives an hour from me in NC shared the shelter with me in the woods of Connecticut). He‚Äôs section hiking the CT section. Apologized for waking him up as it was nearly dark and crashed hard. <br>‚Ä¢<br>In case you‚Äôre wondering, yes, you would have to be some sort of machine if you didn‚Äôt think, at least once, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do this‚Äù at points on the trail. But for me, I have to keep walking. Ironically, if I‚Äôm sick of a state or climbing tall mountains, the only solution is to keep walking. Then I get past those emotions and the physical barriers.

I mope, I moan and I drag along on the first day back after a break. I ended up coming out of my break with foot pain which also slowed me down some. Despite this, I still had a solid 17-mile day on Monday, coming back from the rainy weekend, and found NoBad from Arizona in his hammock at the campsite when I arrived. We split a large IPA given to me as a random gift by Swede from New Jersey, a 2016 thru hiker who is out doing a month-long section. Such a treat! The next day was a shorter 14-mile day because of foot pain. Despite my frustration, of all coincidences I met @pgreenx in person at Silver Hill campsite. He was a 2020 thru hike attempter and I had asked him some gear questions thru Instagram this winter while planning my hike. It was super cool to randomly meet him in person! Pit Stop I hope your Long Trail attempt works out and I see you again in VT in a few weeks. I enjoyed talking with you. <br>‚Ä¢<br>Highlights of this section included some amazing yellow irises, meeting someone who recognized me from my posts of my hike (kinda weird and cool at the same time), seeing the famous AT train stop where hikers who visit NYC get back on trail, some cool NY farmlands, making it to Connecticut (9 down, 5 to go!) and wasting a solid morning in Kent, CT, a very cool small town. CT likes the ups and downs as the trail alternates between passing alongside the Housatonic River and then shooting up to the high ridges above the River valley. Oh well.

If the Virginia blues really are a thing I‚Äôve surrounded myself by people who‚Äôve made sure that they weren‚Äôt. <br>We hiked hard, but we breaked harder and we took the time to treat ourselves and to have some fun along the way. <br>Our days were filled with swimming holes, fishing poles, side trips to campgrounds with hamburgers, and afternoon naps in the sun. <br>The terrain was tough, but the miles came easy and I finally learned to utilize the early morning start time as the only way to beat the heat. <br>When we finally crossed the James River Foot Bridge we were surprised with trail magic burgers, hot dogs, and Sunkist sodas. We talked in length over lunch about which sodas we liked best whether it be Code Red in a can, or root beer from a bottle because these are the things hikers spend their days thinking about. <br>After lunch 8 humans with 8 packs piled into the bed of a truck belonging to a man who ‚Äònever picked up hikers‚Äô and we were on our way to ‚Äòtown‚Äô. <br>Town is a word that should be used loosely around Glasgow as it consists of one restaurant, one store, one gas station and zero stoplights. <br>Glasgow is however home to a free hiker shelter we claimed as home. <br>A thunderstorm was rolling in to break up the heat wave so when we found 4 inner tubes at the shelter we acted fast, grabbed some beers (nitro cold brew for me) and spent the day floating around on the river. <br>Night time came and we sat around the fire eating ice cream and laughing for hours before the rain came and pushed us all into the shelter. <br>When you start a thru hike, you dream all days might be like these (at least I did), and they aren‚Äôt, but that‚Äôs exactly what makes these moments so much more magical. <br><br>#atnobo2021 #appalachiantrailthruhike #appalaciantrailclassof2021 #thruhike #womenwhothruhike #thruhikingwomen #odaat #sober #recoveryispossible #instatravel #travelblogger #instagood"

This day was an emotional one but it was quickly turned around after Crush & Pilgrim let me know about one white claw left in a barn they found. I dropped my pack and made my way down in search of the claw. I ran into Not Sure at the picnic tables and introduced myself as Captain Tyin‚Äô Knots. It feels weird having a trail name but this one fucking rules. I entered the barn and no claws were to be seen anywhere. Took some more steps, made a left and found an empty beer box. I reached inside and was greeted by one mango white claw. It was still cold. I popped it open and took a huge sip.

I had no idea that the beautiful Laurel Falls was ahead. Before reaching the falls, I took a quick swim in the river. The water was cold, but it felt so refreshing. It was starting to get hot & I thrive in the heat.<br>I had seen this famous waterfall many times on other thru hikers pages, but never knew where it was located. It was a wonderful surprise to the end of my day. I hung out by the falls for a while, and then hiked on to find a camp spot. I happened upon a beautiful spot next to the river. Two other trail friends camped there as well and we gathered around the fire for the rest of the evening.

We went up and over Bear Mountain, passed through the zoo, saw my 2nd bear on trail (in a pen, which was pitiful), crossed the Hudson River, ate a massive cheeseburger at a roadside deli on NY Route 9 and decided to hike a few more miles after a cold shower at Graymoor Spiritual Life Center and stealth camped beside Great Value, a student at Princeton taking a semester off to hike the trail. Got up early on Friday and pushed a quick 15+ miles to get to RPH shelter before the afternoon rain started. Bonus: We could order delivery food to the shelter! A large pizza hit the spot. My appetite is a bottomless pit. I can‚Äôt eat enough to abate my hunger. Once the rain started, it got pretty cold, so most of us got in our bags super early. I was happy to be warm and dry inside a shelter. Not gonna lie, NY hiking has been hard. <br>‚Ä¢<br>PG-13 warning!

It was freezing cold and windy on jane bald. We hiked up a blue blaze trail (bonus miles) called Grassy Ridge. There, we found shelter on the side of a giant Christmas tree, which blocked us from the wind. Watching the sunrise is a magical experience. It was 100% worth the uncomfortable nights‚Äô sleep and cold temperatures. If you‚Äôve never experienced the sun rising over the earth, I highly recommend doing so. Little experiences like that change you. After watching the sunrise, we spent the rest of the day hiking over lush green balds where you could see the Appalachian mountains for miles and miles. It‚Äôs always crazy to look out and think, man, I‚Äôve been climbing those if ole mountains! Toward the end of the day we reached the North Carolina boarder where we would officially leave NC for good. We had been crossing over the Tennessee and NC boarder almost daily for the past week. Another state down for now! (even though I‚Äôll be going back to complete the section I missed). It was another absolutely beautiful day on trail.

Followed up an easy day with what was probably my worst/hardest day on trail in the Harriman State Park area. The first part of NY is known as the ‚Äúmisery grind‚Äù and I can attest. It‚Äôs tons of crazy ups and downs (aka PUDs), rock scrambles, the Lemon Squeezer and basically much more elevation changes than what we‚Äôve seen since VA. Oh and it was 90¬∞ and insanely hot and humid. My mind was not ready for the day and I mentally struggled a ton. It took me 12 hours to hike 18 miles. Thankfully, once I made it to the shelter, there were plenty of ‚Äúwhat an insane day‚Äù comments to go around. It‚Äôs not a misery loves company deal at the end of a tough day, but it is emotionally affirming to hear that others struggled just as much as you did. Enjoyed a nice dinner chat with @callmekitchensink and @akpoole77 along with flip-floppers Boneless Thighs, Miles, Rear View and MASH. Plus it rained, which cooled down the insanely hot day. I love sleeping in my @zpacks Duplex when it rains; such a nice sound!<br>‚Ä¢<br>The tough days are hard. And I don‚Äôt share this seeking the ‚Äúyou got this‚Äù type of feedback.

We were all thrilled to get back on trail. About a mile into our hike, we found a beach ball and began playing catch. Old Chicken swung her pole at the beach ball and dislocated her shoulder.

As we climbed through the mountains, we discovered a beautiful forest covered with pine and deep green moss. It was like we all of a sudden walked into a movie. The trees changed to spruces & firs aka Christmas trees all around. This section is known as the Canadian forest. Past the enchanted forest (our coined name for it), we walked through beautiful green meadows. There were all different kinds of wildflowers and butterflies flying around.

Not to say anyone was trying to push me around, or act with malicious intent but I just found myself following, rather than designing my own journey. <br>I‚Äôm forever guilty of putting too much stock into others, who aren‚Äôt investing back in me. <br>Once I decided what kind of hike I wanted to have, the days were better and the sun was brighter. <br>Okay, the sun might have just actually gotten brighter regardless, it‚Äôs heating up out here on trail. <br>No longer acting under the influence of other peoples opinions that hostels, and shelters, and ‚Äòthe bubble‚Äô ought to be avoided at all costs opened my eyes to a whole new version of the trail. <br>In one week without even trying I‚Äôve met more amazing people than I can count. <br>I stay at shelters, I break with others, and I find out that I am not alone. <br>One week ago, I might have walked through this section and let myself believe that I was the only one who struggled. <br>But every night, over little MSR flames we all boiled our water, rehydrated our food, and shared in the fact that we were not alone. <br><br>On day 65 I reached McAfee Knob, and the Tinker Cliffs completing the Virginia Triple Crown. Breathtaking views to take in and of themselves, made even better by the collective sense of accomplishment by reaching them together. <br>Somewhere between complete codependency, and extreme independence I‚Äôm convinced there‚Äôs the perfect sweet spot, and I‚Äôm setting out to find it. <br>I do know that every person I meet is an important part of this story no matter how long their chapter is. <br><br>A joy shared is a joy doubled, a burden shared is a burden halved. <br><br>#appalachiantrail #atnobo2021 #appalachiantrail2021 #appalaciantrailclassof2021 #virginiatriplecrown #mcafeeknob #odaat #recoveryispossible #womenwhothruhike #thruhiking #thruhikingwomen"

We usually carry 3-4 days worth of food out here depending on the mileage and towns. Resupplying can sometimes be tricky, especially at first when you are trying to figure out how much to eat, what you want to eat, weight of foods, etc. However, you learn very quickly the worst thing is to carry food you don‚Äôt actually get around to eating!!<br>After resupplying we slack packed again SOBO 13.7 miles from Beauty Spot Gap back to Uncle Johnny‚Äôs. Along the way we enjoyed some trail magic from Billville, a group who had just come back from trail days. Toward the end of the day we walked past a blue blaze on trail that led to a place called USA Rafting. I insisted we go check it out to see what it was, and low and behold, we entered the vortex. We got some drinks and hung out by the river for while until we got the bright idea to take a zero the next day and go whitewater rafting. Because why not?!! It had been 7 days since the last zero so we were due for one anyway. Within a few minutes of the idea popping up, the trip was booked along with a cute bungalow by the river. Later we walked the remaining mile of the AT back to Uncle Johnny‚Äôs where we camped another night and had a pizza party with new trail friends. I love the spontaneity of this trail and the ability to make your experience on the AT however you want it.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>#appalachiantrail #appalachiantrailthruhike #appalachiantrail2021 #ATthruhike #thruhikingwomen #backpacking #hiking #camping #traillife #at2021 #atclassof2021 #atnobo2021 #getoutside #hikerbabes #backpackingbabes #getoutside #kellyhayshikes"

What I can tell you, is that the latter would t have been possible for me any other way. <br>It‚Äôs more difficult than I would have anticipated not drinking on the trail but on this day I can‚Äôt help but think of how different and impossible my hike would have been otherwise. <br><br>Virginia isn‚Äôt known for its spectacular views, and the ones it is known for are all crammed within 20 miles of each other. <br>The hike up to Dragons Tooth was no treat, but nothing compared to the climb down. With a 1 mile straight rock scramble of a decent it took me almost an hour to get half way down from the top. <br>At the bottom of the climb, the trail crosses a highway where you can walk half a mile to get a burger, but only if you can get there before 8. <br>I was going slow, and it didn‚Äôt look like I was going to get there but suddenly the trail went from black diamond to bunny slope and I was walking with a mission. <br>Feet hit pavement and before I knew what was happening I was in the bed of a pick up on my way to some charbroiled meat. <br>That burger gave me life and for a moment it felt like I was just exactly in the right place at the right time. <br><br>Dragons tooth was hard, and sobriety is harder, but the rewards for both were ever so sweet. <br><br>There are days that I look at a mountain that I need to climb and I think ‚Äòsurely there must be an easier and softer way‚Äô but just like with addiction, there was not. <br><br>I‚Äôm super grateful today for my sobriety, and the strength I‚Äôve found in myself to do the hard thing. I‚Äôm grateful for the ups, and for the downs. Most of all I‚Äôm grateful for all the people who continue to support me along the way. <br>Cheers. <br><br>#sober #recoveryispossible #soberwomen #atnobo2021 #appalachiantrail #appalaciantrailclassof2021 #womenwhothruhike #thruhike #thruhikingwomen #odaat"

I never caught his name, but that was just as well because I preferred to refer to him as ‚ÄòThe General‚Äô most of the time. <br>Our original plan to stay for one night, turned to two nights while we waited for my new glasses to arrive in the mail and while I nursed an injury on my foot that had been trying to heal for too long. <br>On the third day I woke up, and I did not want to hit the trail. It was pouring rain, my glasses weren‚Äôt at the post office, my foot was still swollen and I was looking for reasons not to leave. <br>I pushed for a double zero, and the team was on board but unfortunately our room was no longer available. <br>As the General drove us back into Pearisburg he lamented ‚ÄòI hate to see you guys going back out on a day with such horrible weather.‚Äô <br>As I hopped out of his truck, it felt like a true Christmas story when he told me ‚ÄòWe‚Äôve got no room at The Inn, but if it doesn‚Äôt work out, give me a call and we will throw some mattresses down in the kitchen for you for the night, no charge.‚Äô <br>Wishing he had said that BEFORE we packed up, I thanked him and said goodbye. <br>We were able to find some tent spots at Angels Rest Hostel, which truly was a haven to this hiker. <br>My foot was healing, but I knew one more day would really bring it to where it needed it to be, and mentally I was in the same place. <br>I was very worried that heading into the rain, when I wasn‚Äôt 100% would set the tone for this next section for me, right back into the negative space I had walked out of the last one. <br>Insert here a really big metaphor between letting the visible injury of my ankle heal, and taking the time to heal my less visible mental injury. <br>#atnobo2021"

Running is one of my favorite forms of therapy & I needed it this day. If you know me, you know I like to push myself and challenge myself physically. That is a big part of why I wanted to do the AT. It feels so good to put in work everyday & experience yourself becoming stronger. Not only am I becoming stronger physically everyday, but also mentally. The trail is a perfect oasis to hash out mental battles and talk about it with God. It sounds clich√©, but I always feel closer to Him in nature.

The lasting quote from this day was from an older gentlemen I met on trail, he simply said: ‚ÄúThere is no where on earth better to be than to be here right now.‚Äù<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>#appalachiantrail #appalachiantrailthruhike #appalachiantrail2021 #ATthruhike #thruhikingwomen #backpacking #hiking #camping #traillife #at2021 #atclassof2021 #atnobo2021 #getoutside #hikerbabes #backpackingbabes #getoutside #kellyhayshikes"

We finalized plans of where to meet a couple days into my hike. Fast forward a few days and I‚Äôm in the ER about to have emergency surgery.

Also, apparently I cut off the second video. Mainly the rocks keep me from getting a good stride/breathing rhythm going. All runners know what I mean. <br>‚Ä¢<br>Hiked on and off for these last two days with Teacher, an Army vet who is in transition to school in the fall. Awesome guy and I discovered that he enjoys the same habit as me: Hike into towns around 3pm when it‚Äôs really hot, eat a ton of food and drink a lot of fluids, enjoy air conditioning for an hour or two and then hike back out up to the ridge line, add a few more miles to the day and setup camp at dusk. I never thought I would do this as I‚Äôve preferred the fellowship of conversations at shelters at the evening, but I must admit I really like the new habit! I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll be able to keep this up in New Jersey as the topography and road crossings are somewhat different, but I have heard of the term ‚Äúdeli blazing,‚Äù that describes where hikers can eat lunch at a deli and pack out a sandwich for dinner. Let me clear up any confusion, in case you‚Äôre wondering. I am becoming true hiker trash! I smell horrible, I‚Äôm typically either completely sweaty or covered in salt stains once my shirt dries, and my beard is really getting out of control. Yesterday at a sports bar in Wind Gap, I ate the ‚ÄúGeorge Foreman burger,‚Äù a massive cheeseburger with two 8 oz patties on it. I thought it was a good idea when I read the menu, but when the waitress put it in front of me I thought, ‚Äúoops.‚Äù Of course it was gone in ten minutes. Teacher ate an entire large pizza! Good times. <br>‚Ä¢<br>Almost stepped on rattlesnake #2 today that was sandwiched between two rocks near Wolf Rock. I didn‚Äôt, thankfully...

We hiked a 13.4 mile section SOBO (southbound). Not only did we slack pack this day but we also flip flopped. Flip flopping is when you do sections of the trail out of order. We had to do this due to the shuttle situation, which was not in our favor due to trail days and a gas shortage. The good news was we had a plan in place to get back to where we needed to go to ensure we hiked every single foot of the trail.

It was a very exciting and unexpected experience. We then continued our hike through what I thought was the most scenic day in Shenandoah National Park. There were at least 10 spectacular views along the mountain ridge, but my two favorites were definitely Stony Man Mountain and Mary‚Äôs Rock. Our massive group of hikers cowboy camped at a stealth spot where Thornton River Trail intersects with the AT. <br>Day 74 (22 miles): We started our final day in Shenandoah Nation Park by having breakfast at Elkwallow Wayside. About half of my group made a last minute decision to hike all the way into Front Royal that day, so we could spend the night in a hotel. Because it was already late morning, we had to essentially speed walk the remaining 20 miles. The hike was consistent with the rest of the park with relatively gentle climbs, frequent views, and beautiful budding trees. At the end of the day, I was sad to say goodbye to Shenandoah, but happy to sleep indoors. <br>Day 75 (16 miles): I woke up in the town of Front Royal, where I had breakfast and completed a 3 day resupply from Burger King. Many thru hikers attempt the fast food challenge, where they buy all of their food from a single fast food restaurant. Because I am a vegetarian, this consisted of almost entirely impossible burgers. I started hiking around 1:00 pm, so I only stopped for one break at Jim and Molly Denton Shelter on the way to my campsite. The terrain for the day was extremely flat, but I felt really tired for most of the hike. In hindsight, this was probably caused by an excessive consumption of fast food. We ended the night with our usual tramily campfire. <br><br>#appalachiantrail #atnobo2021 #atthruhike2021 #appalachiantrail2021 #hikertrash #shenandoahnationalpark"

A ‚Äúzero‚Äù is a day where you hike 0 miles of the trail, basically like a day off. These days were much needed for me as I am trying to ease back into heavily exerting my body. Stephanie and Grace were also beat down from a rough section through the smokies so it was good for all of us. We enjoyed a 2 nights stay at Laughing Heart Hostel, where I was happily reunited with all my trail friends. The hostel was walking distance from everything you needed from the town of Hot Springs-restaurants, Dollar General, and the Hillbilly General Store where we resupplied our food. The last night of our stay in town we soaked in the mineral water of Hot Springs that are said to be healing of all ailments. & I secretly hoped that water would heal all of mine üòÜ I absolutely loved this little town, met some wonderful new friends, and already can‚Äôt wait to take my van back out this way after the trail and visit.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>#appalachiantrail #appalachiantrailthruhike #appalachiantrail2021 #ATthruhike #thruhikingwomen #backpacking #hiking #camping #traillife #at2021 #atclassof2021 #atnobo2021 #getoutside #hikerbabes #backpackingbabes #getoutside #kellyhayshikes #gorpo"

The truth is, I was pretty hellbent on being miserable. Thankfully, the day really had other plans for me. The sun WAS shining, the terrain forgiving, and the company kind. <br>I even got to enjoy a surprise ice cream cone from an outpost directly on the trail and I thought ‚ÄòThe trail really does provide‚Äô. <br>And then there was day 57, where I had probably my biggest breakdown, and my biggest breakthrough. <br>My pack has been bothering me, and after trying to make a few minor adjustments, I had only made it worse. <br>In the middle of the trail, I went full Cheryl Strayed. I threw my trekking poles, dropped my pack and threw a tantrum that would put all toddlers to shame. <br>I walked backwards, went back down the hill, and sat down. I then of course had to walk back up the hill, put my pack back on, and keep going because I‚Äôm in the middle of a forest and nobody is coming to save me. <br>But here‚Äôs what I realized: The hike, is not the problem. The hike is not the problem, nor is it the solution. <br>I think the mostly mentally stable, at peace, calm individual could come out to this trail and would still find themselves at some point or another, just, emotionally shook. <br>I also think that I don‚Äôt come anywhere close to falling into that demographic and neither do most of the people who set out to hike this trail. <br>The problem is within me, and I can‚Äôt just hide from it by running into the woods. As negative as that may sound, the really promising part is that the solutions come from inside of me too, and the trail sometimes has the most perfect way of helping me find them. <br>That‚Äôs the short version, anyway. <br>It‚Äôs been rough, but stay tuned, because this girl is going to get to Maine. <br><br>#atnobo2021 #appalachianhikers #appalachiantrailclassof2021 #womeninrecovery #womenwhothruhike #odaat #thruhiking #thruhikingwomen"

Not much of a flower guy usually but the end of the smokies and the hike today has been converting me as we‚Äôve walked through fields of flowers.  Now that we are through the first major section of the trail, I can start thinking (probably prematurely) about what it‚Äôll take to have a realistic shot at finishing the trail.  A 14 mile per day average should get us to Katahdin around mid-September and Baxter State Park closes for the winter on October 15th and will sometimes close early if snow comes early in the season.  We are currently averaging 9.1 miles per day.

Left the Quality Inn in Carlisle, PA, got a tasty to go breakfast from the Middlesex Diner and hiked 17.2 miles to get to Duncannon, PA, where I was graciously picked up by @nedmcghee who drove me to Chadds Ford to spend some quality time with him and @joyce.mcghee00. I had only planned to spend one night with them, but when I woke up at 4am and could barely walk to the bathroom because my feet and Achilles‚Äô tendons hurt so much, I decided on a zero day on Wednesday. Wow did I need it. Sandwiching 26 and 27 mile days between some 17s and 18s had me super sore. I had to listen to my body. And of course it didn‚Äôt hurt that Joyce and Ned are two of my favorite people and they fed me like crazy. Dinnertime fellowship both nights was fantastic. Thank you so much Joyce and Ned! It was so great to spend time with you both and to have a relaxing zero day. <br>‚Ä¢<br>From Carlisle to Duncannon, I saw more cool farms, kept the cow conversations going, had some great vantage points of the Cumberland Valley, saw some words of wisdom written on a white blaze, met Sophie the Weimaraner who reminded me of a former pet, met Boomerang Dan and a friend who gave me some awesome trail magic at Hawk Rock and was welcomed eagerly to Chadds Ford by Hudson (pictured) and Winnie (sorry Winnie I didn‚Äôt get a pic!). Had a great talk with Midnight, a middle school music teacher from Maine, as we came down the hill into Duncannon. He‚Äôs a great person to talk with on trail. Solid day. <br>‚Ä¢<br>I‚Äôm back out now between groups of friends and shelters, so I‚Äôve stealth camped the last two nights and am alone tonight. Kinda weird. Pushing for Hamburg by Sunday.

We passed the 900 mile mark, which means we only have 100 left to 1000! I took a long break at the top of High Top Mountain, where I had camped on a short trip about a year ago. It‚Äôs crazy to think that I‚Äôm thru hiking the AT only a year after I did my first section hike. We managed to fit our whole group of 10 in a small stealth camp spot by a fire road. <br>Day 72 (14 miles): We had a relaxing morning, where we stopped at a camp store and got breakfast and coffee. We then hiked another 7 miles to Big Meadow Lodge, where we laid in the grassy fields and had a big lunch. We spent the night at Rock Spring Hut. We met another big tramily and had a fire.

I kicked my the side of my tent a few times, before finally sitting up to check. When I did wake up, I didn‚Äôt find any friends, but I did discover that somehow I had slept with my tent door fully unzipped. I zipped it up and struggled to go back to sleep. <br>When I woke up the second time, I tried to blame my sluggishness on my early morning visitor. I caught a lot of flack for this as it‚Äôs not uncommon for me to hear sounds that maybe aren‚Äôt there. <br>So, it was somewhat of an odd victory for me, when I tossed my drink bag out of the tent and crystal light flew everywhere. I had fallen victim to a mouse invasion, but that also made me right and the guys wrong. <br>We broke down camp, and headed out for the 8.5 miles of climbing we had to start our day. <br>At the point, I‚Äôm not even mad about the climbing.

I won‚Äôt even beg pardon for my language,  because any other synonym doesn‚Äôt seem fitting. <br>I reached Chestnut Knob Shelter which is completely enclosed and made myself a cup of coffee to try to warm up. It didn‚Äôt work. <br>I sat in this shelter, I shivered, and I cried. All I wanted in this moment was out. 75 percent of this hike lays in front of me and I don‚Äôt want to do it. At this point, I have nothing to prove and I‚Äôm SO tired of being cold.

A large portion of the trail was flat and easy and it was a nice day, so miles were to be made. <br>‚Ä¢<br>This was a 360¬∞ day. No that‚Äôs not a geometry mistake. Started the day so happy to see the sun and managed to get in an early lunch at Green Mountain general store. Decided on a whim to go for the 27+ day. Then, the not-so glamorous side of thru hiking showed up. Because of my colon cancer surgery 11 years ago, I have a shorter and somewhat sensitive lower intestine. Something I had consumed decided to cause bad intestinal distress (sorry, TMI I know), which threw about a 90-minute delay in my planned day. I was so mad and frustrated and mentally I was in a bad spot. But the bout subsided and I made it out of PA‚Äôs version of the rollercoaster (no signage or fanfare, which makes VA‚Äôs look even more overhyped) into lots of rolling, gorgeous farmlands. The day was amazing. Walked through Boiling Springs, which was super cool and beautiful and then pushed the last 7ish miles to Carlisle through really easy terrain. Beautiful evening. Made it to pick up my takeout order at the Middlesex Diner about 20 minutes before they closed and then split a hotel room with Snacks and Gangster @williamrhyne, who I haven‚Äôt seen since March 5, after we had hiked the first 3 weeks of our treks together. So yeah, a 360¬∞ day. Started great, turned horrible, returned to beyond fantastic. Headed to Duncannon today where I‚Äôll get off trail for the night to see friends. <br>‚Ä¢<br>The AT has its ups and downs. Such a pun, but so, so true. To be successful, you must embrace the suck and cherish the highlights. What a journey this has and continues to be. And of course today is sunny and gorgeous.

The bonus: Stopping at convenience stores and restaurants during the day to supplement what‚Äôs in my food bag. A large Gatorade midday is pretty nice for sure. <br><br>#goldiewalks #appalachiantrail #appalachiantrail2021 #atnobo #atnobo2021 #GA2ME #GAME #georgiatomaine #thruhike #trektheat #whiteblaze #backpacking #hikertrash #thruhiking #optoutside #leavenotrace #seeksimplicity #nature #hiking #adventure #findyourownpath #notallwhowanderarelost <br><br>üìç Massawomeck"

Day 49 was one of those, but in the best way. From start to finish the day was coated in magic, and my cup was filled full to the brim. The first morning without warmer layers was brisk indeed, but the rain had stopped and that was a win. A major shakedown in Damascus left me with a much lighter pack, and a noticeable spring in my step. Early on in the day the trail crossed through a gated pasture filled with grazing cows and their nursing calves. There‚Äôs an immeasurable tenderness that comes in witnessing these moments between patient mamas and their babies that made me realize how much I missed growing up on a farm. With my affinity for all things four legged, this would have been more than enough for me but the day only got better from here. Miles passed beneath my feet with ease and brought me to the foot of the Grayson Highlands. If you don‚Äôt know about the Grayson Highlands, which I didn‚Äôt, its the home to herds of wild ponies. We came over a ridge, and there it was‚Äî a wild pony alone in the distance. With hushed voices, and quiet feet we crept a bit closer to take her in, in all her majesty. I soon came to find out that our furtive measures were needless as we were suddenly surrounded by ponies who were not only not afraid of us, but quite the opposite. I may not have known what was up, but these ponies did, and before I knew it I had become a human salt lick. I was able to sneak in a few head pats as they took their fill of my dried salty sweat, and  my heart all but exploded. <br>Between the ponies, and the views it took me nearly two hours to hike just two miles and it was impossible to be in any hurry to leave. <br>But, leave I did. <br>We all met at my insistence to take a family photo with the 500 mile marker and to set our final meeting place for the day. <br><br>#appalachiantrailclassof2021 #atnobo2021 #appalachiantrail2021 #appalachiantrail #graysonhighlands #thruhiking #womenwhothruhike #thruhikingwomen"

Apparently Lloyd the dog frequently goes on adventures with thru hikers on the AT. On the climb up Humpback Mountain, I encountered another rattle snake. I hope that my fear of snakes diminishes soon, or the next 3 months are going to be really tough. The view from the top of Humpback Mountain was spectacular, but we didn‚Äôt stay there long because we were antsy to reach Waynesboro. In fact, we were so excited to get to town that Snack Meister and I speed walked the last couple of miles to Rockfish Gap, where we then got a ride into town. Snack Meister and I split a room with 3 of our new hiker friends (the three girls), while the rest of our tramily stayed at a hostel. <br>Day 68 (0 miles): We spent the day in Waynesboro eating, resupplying, and relaxing. We were finally able to regroup with Old Chicken and Geodude. We hadn‚Äôt been apart from them for this long for the entirety of our trip, so it was very exciting to see them. We camped at free tent sites reserved for AT thruhikers. We were all amazed at how hiker friendly everyone was in Waynesboro. It was a fantastic zero! <br>Day 69 (8 miles): Our new tramily of 10 headed to a local diner for breakfast. We were all shocked when a trail angel paid for our entire breakfast. Right as we reached Rockfish Gap, where we entered Shenandoah National Park it started raining. The rain made it very difficult for all of us to fill out our hiker permits. On the bright side, the rain made the forrest appear even more green and vibrant than usual. When we reached Calf Mountain Shelter  we decided to end our day early because it was so wet and cold. We spent the rest of the day hanging out and making food. <br>#appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #atnobo2021 #atthruhike2021 #hikertrash #shenandoahnationalpark"

Norovirus is very contagious, very miserable, and very gross‚Äî which made for great table side conversation. <br>Thankfully for us, we don‚Äôt really stay at shelters, and we tent at hostels so our antisocial/cheap tendencies would hopefully work in our favor. <br>Knowing I‚Äôd be an unlikely host, of course, did not deter me from spending the whole day having phantom noro symptoms. <br><br>#atnobo2021 #appalachiantrail #thruhike #womenwhothruhike #thruhikingwomen #appalachiantrailclassof2021"

Technically, it was slightly less (~51 miles of trail), but Rope Burn and I did around 52 miles, as we accidentally took a blue-blaze trail to the ATC headquarters. <br>We started at 2:10am and finished at 7:29pm, for a grand total of 17 hours and 19 minutes of hiking.<br><br>I‚Äôm sore.

We took it a step farther, and camped 7 miles south of the border, just to do a 50+ mile day. <br><br>One thing that excites me about a double marathon day is simply the standard that we have now set for ourselves. We hiked with full packs over difficult terrain, and stopped only briefly for a bit of food and water. We are tired and sore now, but the next time we attempt a big day, we will be far stronger and have even more endurance. We can start earlier, finish later, move faster, stop less frequently... etc. <br><br>I am looking forward to what is in store, be it an absurd challenge, a series of long difficult days, or a speed attempt at some of the hard sections. <br><br>But for now, we rest. <br><br>Life is good on the trail.<br>-Junco<br><br>#trektheat #appalachiantrail #atnobo2021 #adventure #explore #marathon #hiking"

He lived through the worst of things and was even at Auschwitz. From not knowing if he would be next in the gas chamber, doing backbreaking work in sub-zero temps in frozen shoes with no socks, he kept himself semi-sane by studying the human nature of his fellow prisoners and the horrible Nazis who made their lives a literal living hell. This book is really life changing and eye opening.  He did find meaning in life and that is to love and be loved.

Resupplied, showered and did laundry, ate a bunch of food and watched the Kentucky Derby with our hosts Danielle and David.

Sadly the ‚Äútrail magic‚Äù was not a cold drink...but I did score some toilet paper! In an impulsive mood, we got a hotel room in Winchester, VA and relaxed. The next day, Blake dropped me at Ashby Gap and then drove to Snickers Gap and hiked SOBO to meet me midway. I started the rollercoaster, passed the 1000 mile mark (yeehaw!!!) and made it to Bear‚Äôs Den hostel. We got sidetracked at Bear Chase brewery (aka Drinking, Inc.) and didn‚Äôt manage to make it to Blackburn Trail Center, our original destination spot, instead finding an awesome stealth site by a creek and spring. We enjoyed some fellowship as it got dark and then ducked into the tent/hammock before it gently rained on and off during the night. It was a fun two days.<br>‚Ä¢<br>Northern VA is not super challenging hiking, despite the excessive signage for the rollercoaster, but it is rocky with many miles of ‚Äúfoot puzzle‚Äù walking, where you‚Äôre constantly looking at the trail to decide on your next footstep. It can be frustrating, but if you get in a groove, it is insanely meditative. Or maybe it is just for me...! It is interesting walking through some pretty amazing VA horse farm country. We‚Äôre not in Appalachia anymore, Toto!<br>‚Ä¢<br>Planning to post my hike into Harpers Ferry and my sightseeing/tourist zero day tomorrow. Stay tuned.

We started our own little bubble as everyone else was either behind or ahead of us, but the ‚Äúestrogen bubble‚Äù is rocking the trail now!!! At cherry gap shelter we found some crusty pants on the roof of the shelter and had to wash and roast them on the fire, of course!! We got some trail magic from some day hikers, which was pretty nice üëçüëç then the good mood took a pretty bad turn and I was throwing up all night and the big miles did not come back after that.

Allow me to illustrate: <br><br>My first inclination is to search the canopy or foliage for any avian creatures that might make themselves visible to me. This creates several problems, as keeping my eyes away from the ground increases the likelihood of tripping (and has even caused full-blown crashing into trees), and though it is often quite rewarding, means that I miss out on whatever might be scurrying or slithering by my feet. <br><br>My second inclination is to keep my eyes on the ground, scanning for roots, rocks, snakes, salamanders, etc. This typically prevents me from tripping, and is rewarding in its own right, but not wholly so. <br><br>Therefore, my multitasking strategy has arisen. As I walk, I scan the ground for tripping hazards and exciting reptiles, whilst keeping my ears peeled for whatever may be singing in the trees above. I know to look up based on proximity of the song, what bird it is I hear, or if there is anything unusual about the melody. Often I will even put one of my headphones in, listen to a beautiful piece of music, and keep the other ear alert for any of the aforementioned sounds. <br><br>This has proven to be the most efficient strategy, though perhaps I will improve upon it a couple hundred miles from now. Time will tell. <br><br>Yes I saw a bear. Yes it was the last day in Shenandoah National Park. Yes it took almost 1000 miles to see one.

Although the wayside grills in SNP were not open, several camp stores were open as well as the restaurants at Big Meadows and Skyline Resort were. Of course the food at those spots is overpriced, but the value of paying more to eat was totally worth it as I didn‚Äôt have to carry so much weight on my back.

I spent much more time forest walking, something I think I‚Äôll do more in the mid Atlantic area. As forest walks are my jam at home in the Triangle NC area, I enjoyed this past week immensely. Lots of time for contemplation and self reflection, which I appreciate. The animals in the park don‚Äôt fear humans that much as they‚Äôve never been hunted and don‚Äôt see us as predators. Unfortunately I didn‚Äôt see any bears... The concrete posts weren‚Äôt WPA projects, they were CCC projects, as is most of the development in SNP. The shelters are called ‚Äúhuts‚Äù in SNP. They were nice and I met lots of neat folks in this section. I‚Äôm starting to meet more SOBO flip-flop hikers who started in Harper‚Äôs Ferry, WV and are headed to Springer before completing the northern half of the trail after.

We split off with my parents and hiked the next 5 miles along a ridge to Tinker‚Äôs Cliffs. The views were amazing, but I was sad that the Virginia Triple Crown was coming to an end.

The rest of my tramily continued hiking, but I was excited to crank out a ton of mileage the next day to catch up with them. <br>Day 60 (28 miles): I was dropped of by my parents in the morning, knowing I had a long day ahead of me. The hike started with beautiful grassy meadows and the 1/3 of the way to Katahdin sign. It was exciting to have reached this big milestone, but it was strange that I didn‚Äôt have my friends to celebrate it with. The latter half of the day went along a ridge and had many spectacular views from the Blue Ridge Parkway. I caught up with my group at Jennings Creek right before it got dark.

At first, it was a surprisingly difficult question for me to answer. Partly because there are so many highs, so many lows, and so many experiences concentrated in such an insanely short amount of time. <br>Partly because frankly, you just had to be there. Some of these experiences I share with my trail family, and some of them are strictly between the mountains, and me. <br>Some of the lows and highs are obvious. Camping in 7 degree weather, low point. Max Patch, high point. Setting up my tent in a monsoon‚Äî low. Camping under stars‚Äîhigh. <br><br>But the real highs, are the less obvious ones, the ones I see alone. The real highs‚Äî those come immediately following the lows. <br>It‚Äôs the view from the summit, after a 5 mile climb. <br>It‚Äôs the first step I take, after swearing I couldn‚Äôt take another. <br>Its proving to myself that I can, after a lifetime of telling myself that I couldn‚Äôt. <br>It‚Äôs remembering where I was a year ago, a month ago, a day ago, and seeing where I am today. <br>The trail has gifted me not only this insane opportunity to grow, but more importantly this indescribable vantage point to watch myself do it. <br>From this proverbial summit, I can see where I‚Äôve been, and where I‚Äôve yet to go. There will be more peaks, there will be more valleys. <br>I‚Äôve come pretty far, I‚Äôve got a long way to go, but damn it, I‚Äôm gonna get there. <br><br>#appalachiantrailclassof2021 #appalaciantrail #atnobo2021 #sobermovement #sober #thruhikingwomen #thruhiking #odaat #recoveryispossible"

Truth be told, going into Pearisburg, Double Down and I got into a big argument and hiked alone for a week. This is part of any relationship, especially for siblings who hike together all day for months and months. Sometimes you just need a break, so when we linked back up it was all Gucci again, but the time spent alone in nature is such a pleasant experience. Unfortunately, Double Down is in a lot of pain that can't be ignored, so we are kind of going to switch some things up for a bit. <br>....<br>One of the coolest parts of this whole trail so far has been linking up with Open, who we met and hiked with for a bit on the Continental Divide Trail. He lives in Lexington and met us at the trail with beer and hotdogs so we could have a fun cookout. He is one of the most genuine friends you could ever be lucky to have,  and is a triple crowner already which is very inspiring! We've been bumming it in Lexington for a few days while we figure things out. Enjoying the local history, Thai cuisine, and board games night in a Super 8. We were also able to get our second Covid vaccination shot which feels like such a blessing. So I'm sending out so much love, everyone!

I suspect this is because the weather outside still looked frightful, and none of us were in a rush to leave. <br>But, checkout was at 11, and we found ourselves out on the curb. We called our old friend Doug, who had saved us from Indian Grave Gap the morning before and asked for a ride back. <br>He had lots of other rides and said he could get to us by 12:30. So, with an hour and a half to kill we had Mexican food for the 3rd time. <br>After lunch, we returned to the curb when Miss Janet pulled up and said ‚ÄòYou guys look so sad, they wouldn‚Äôt let you smelly hikers into the restaurant?‚Äô <br>Miss Janet is a well known trail angel, who drives the whole length of the trail offering help to hikers all along the way.

The first half of our hike was very flat, with many green plants lining the trail. Virginia has been a nice break from the constant climbs and descents we have gotten used to. About half way through the hike, we stopped for a long break by a pond. It was a perfect day to lay around in the grass and enjoy the warm spring weather. We finished our day by hiking to Woods Hole Hostel, where we stayed the night. The hostel was very well kept, and the staff grew and cooked all of their food from scratch. It was by far my favorite hostel I‚Äôve stayed in so far.<br>Day 53 (13 miles): We started our morning to a delicious homemade breakfast at Woods Hole Hostel. As we started hiking, it started snowing. I had already sent most of my cold weather gear home, so I wasn‚Äôt thrilled. We cruised through the first 12 miles of the day because it was too cold to take long breaks. When we reached the town of Pearisburg, we resupplied and had some pizza for dinner. It was extremely difficult to leave the pizza joint and hike another mile into the woods in the cold. We camped right before the start of the Peter‚Äôs Mountain Closure, prepared for the difficult section of trail that was waiting for us the next day. <br>Day 54 (20 miles): We packed up our tents in the cold and started the Peter‚Äôs Mountain Closure, which had just been opened the night before. We were pleasantly surprised by the first 8 miles of hiking, as it was in pretty good condition. This section went through some gorgeous mountain top fields, with spectacular views. Our luck came to end, however, when all of a sudden, the trail was covered in fallen trees and branches. There must have been a huge storm since the start of the closure because the trail was almost impassable. Luckily, the trail returned to normal conditions after about 5 miles, allowing us to enjoy the accent to Pine Swamp Branch Shelter. We ended the night by cooking smokers over a fire. <br><br>#appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #woodsholehostel #atnobo2021 #atnobo #hikingadventures"

I walked in a camp area before the shelter I was staying at, saw Huck, and got really excited to see such a cute puppers. I introduced myself and Stephanie and I chatted for a bit. Little did I know just a few days later this girl would play a major role in helping save my life from a serious medical condition. Stephanie was at camp the morning that my pain started. I finally got the courage to announce that I was not okay and Stephanie was right there by my side. She held the Walmart bag I kept throwing up in, googled all the things I thought was going on, and stayed calm, cool, and collected the whole time. I told her a few times that I wasn‚Äôt going to be okay, but she assured me with confidence I would be fine. When it came time to leave camp, Stephanie wore her backpack on her back and my backpack in front. This girl carried over 50 lbs of gear for 5 miles out of the AT! Total badass! She took charge and led me, Grace, and Huck to where we needed to go. I had only known this girl for a couple days and she did all that for me. I can never say thank you enough, Stephanie, you are a blessing in my life more than you‚Äôll ever know. This strong woman also served our country, and is a Navy veteran. Right now she is doing a fundraiser for @warriorexpeditions on her thru hike to help struggling veterans find solace on long-distance adventures like the AT. Please go check out her page to donate!

Not a lot to report that day. I took a lotta naps, ate a lotta pizza, and watched a lotta Judge Judy. <br>Day 35 we nearo-ed out of town. We didn‚Äôt hit the trail until 2pm after sitting around Uncle Jonnys Hostels drinking beer and Diet Coke. <br>We camped after 8 miles and made an award winning fire to be enjoyed for hours, knowing with rain in the forecast the next day would be rough. <br>I got tucked into my tent and watched The Wedding Planner for the first time in a decade, and either forgot how dumb that movie was, or realized for the first time. <br>I was sleeping pretty well despite the fact that I‚Äôm on a four night streak of picking a horrible tent space until I woke up to an earth shaking boom accompanied by a huge flash. <br>From our tents we speculated whether it was thunder, or whether Cleatus, our made up 5th wheel was out firing his gun again at 5:37 in the morning. And then again, a second boom, second flash, louder and longer than the first. <br>Camped fairly close to power lines, we realized it was most likely a transformer. <br>We turned on our phones to find weather warnings advising hikers to leave the mountains. <br>Knowing we were less than a mile from a road, I jokingly offered ‚ÄòYou know, we COULD just go back to Erwin for the night.‚Äô One by one the team quickly agreed and we were booking a room by 8, a room we were lucky to get considering most other hikers in the area had the same idea. So, another day in Erwin, it‚Äôs not ideal, but at least we were able to squeeze 8 miles out of yesterday. <br>So, day 36 we ate, we slept, we watched Naked and Afraid. <br>We‚Äôre hoping for a decent day tomorrow, and Damascus really feels just around the corner. <br><br>#atnobo2021 #appalachiantrailclassof2021 #appalachiantrail #thruhike #womenwhothruhike #thruhiking #thruhikingwomen #odaat"

Grace shares the same faith as me, so I knew from the beginning the Lord put us in each others lives for a reason. Fast forward less than a week after meeting in person on trail, and so happens my crazy experience on trail. Grace stayed by my side the entire day, seriously everytime I looked up she was there. She prayed over me multiple times, comforted me when I was scared, constantly reminded me I was going to be okay, and stayed at the ER with me the whole time until my surgery (roughly 8 hours). I could not of made it through that day without this girl. I am forever grateful that God brought this wonderful friend into my life & I‚Äôm thankful for her kindness, support, and beautiful Jesus-loving soul.

Two other hikers, Unicorn and Jack Rabbit stayed with us the night before and had offered to slack pack us today. If you don‚Äôt know what slack packing means, it means that Unicorn loaded all of our packs into her van/house and drove it to us 14 miles ahead, giving us the opportunity to hike the day 30 pounds lighter.<br>Unicorn was kind enough to loan me her Fanny pack which I filled with snacks before setting off into the hills. <br>Lending some credit to the fact that I was light as a feather today I was really able to enjoy my surroundings. Having walked this trail for a month it‚Äôs been truly incredible to watch the forest change around me. When I started there was a grayness that has slowly been transitioning to green. It‚Äôs still cold, but spring is springing and each day you can see the forest becoming alive. <br>The green tunnel is beginning to exist, but occasionally, and suddenly the ground is open and covered with thousands of tiny white wildflowers baked by the sun so that you may smell them even before you see them. <br>Then there are the balds, and I love the balds.

Sometimes when you summit a mountain, it‚Äôs mysteriously bald, blanketed only with grass and flowers, giving you panoramic views of the world beyond.<br>I would have spent all day up on Big Bald, but it was very cold, and Maine is still very far away. <br>Eventually the time came for me to reluctantly trade my Fanny pack back to Unicorn and begrudgingly I donned MY pack and went back on my way. <br>We hiked another 4.5 miles to the No Business Knob shelter for a total of 18.5 miles for the day. <br>I limped into camp, wincing in pain from an ingrown toenail that I‚Äôve been trying to pretend didn‚Äôt exist.

I spent the afternoon hanging out with trail friends and soaking my feet in the creek. That night, I had the best night of sleep since I had been on trail.

I decided to take a page from his playbook and rested myself a little further up. He eventually passed me, and as we leap frogged I noticed a patch on the back of his pack. ‚ÄòNo Rush.‚Äô <br>I passed him and awkwardly said ‚ÄòWe got a lotta climbing today..‚Äô <br>He smiled at me and said ‚ÄòWe sure do, but that patch on my pack, that‚Äôs my trail name, and I‚Äôm in no rush.‚Äô <br>I smiled back, never saw him again, and probably never will. <br>But I went that way, the rest of the day‚Äî in no rush. <br>I took breaks, I ate snacks, I even made midday coffee. <br>I didn‚Äôt worry about who was passing me, how far ahead my friends were, or how many miles I was going to make today. <br>Midway through the day, there was an opportunity to take a side trail to a scenic outlook, an opportunity I definitely would have passed up yesterday, I took today. <br>A sketchy little trail, best done sans pack, lead to quite possibly the most breathtaking view I‚Äôve ever seen. I sat there a while just taking it in, I was in no rush. I sat there thankful for the view, for that moment, and even for yesterday‚Äôs pain that made today‚Äôs victory so much sweeter. <br>For every ounce of anguish I felt yesterday I felt two ounces of joy today. <br>30 days in, and just over 300 miles.

Saw some gorgeous vistas, including a view of the James River for the first time and also saw a ton of what looks like lambs ear hosta sprouting beside the trail.

Super excited!<br>‚Ä¢<br>Not much else to report from today except that a Facebook post in the Class of 2021 thru hiker group really irked me. I don‚Äôt get in online fights as they are a total waste of time, but someone posted that they are beyond bored by Virginia.

Look at the wildflowers all around you! Revel in the green valleys and rolling farmlands! Enjoy the ‚Äòeasier‚Äô hiking!‚Äù But of course, I didn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm just sharing my frustrations with you.

Got the iconic McAfee shot, hiked with more cows, LOVED Tinker Cliffs and got some cool #cloudporn, met Krispy and Downhill, two Covid outlaw thru hikers from 2020 who were kind enough to give me a cold IPA, got blown away by more Virginia beauty and finished up the day with an awesome view of Carvins Cove Reservoir before making the steep descent into Daleville.

And the icing on the cake? I listened to the Wilco album Sky Blue Sky during the last 3-4 miles of my day and...wow. I love that album. I‚Äôm a musician and I‚Äôm willing to assert that Nels Cline‚Äôs solo in the song Impossible Germany is perhaps the best guitar solo - ever. Go listen to it.

I've been able to take the knee brace off and my body truly feels like it's back to 100%. Even though I did eat that huge Anaconda Burrito at that gas station that we found along trail and it made me feel like shit for a day, I still feel wonderful!<br>....<br>I can say that the Grayson Highlands are yet another highlight of the trail so far. We camped right at mile 500 and the next day was filled with ponies and landscapes! They had trouble with vegetation just taking over all of the trails so they unleashed ponies and they've been the ones maintaining ever since. I was even treated to seeing pony sex near a shelter, which was very educational. üòÇ This trail has been nothing like the CDT or PCT in terms of views, which means when you get some good views it's time to soak it up. The video on slide 4 is my favorite part of the trail so far. :)<br>....<br>After those highlands it was back to business as usual for the AT. A lot of green tunnel walking, but the climbs seem to be getting much more steady in grade, instead of straight up and down. It's been a lot easier on my body! Even with the bigger mileage days I've still been getting to camp before 7pm which feels really good! <br>....<br>With all that said, I'm starting the LOTR audiobooks books today, but does anyone have any good podcast suggestions or spotify playlists? I'm ready for some new new.

The threat of rain was on the horizon, but with high hopes fulfilled we reached Max Patch with clear skies. I would try to describe the splendor of Max Patch to you, but my efforts would be futile. It is truly something that you need to see for yourself to understand. Even then, I‚Äôm convinced much of the splendor comes from that moment you feel the wind whipping through your sails, with the satisfaction of knowing you had walked over 250 miles to see it. <br>We had lunch at Max Patch, I pet a few dogs, and we hurried on down the trail. We had two more climbs and many more miles to conquer in order to meet our goals for the day. <br>The air was hot, thick and muggy‚Äî as it is just before a storm. So thick I almost found myself wishing for a little drizzle. <br>You‚Äôve got to be careful what you wish for, however. After all, the last time I found myself wishing for something, I was longing for some semblance of the femininity the trail has stripped from me and that didn‚Äôt turn out so well. <br>Besides, the rain was coming regardless. <br>After reaching the top of our final climb for the day, a debate was had between tenting there or pressing on. <br>We went for the latter and this is was truly a roll of the dice. Moving forward meant a huge descent towards the next gap with little to no tenting space anywhere in between, risking getting caught in the rain. <br>So we walked, and we walked fast. <br>There are 3 truths unanimously accepted by the team: <br>Sticks is always cold, Sticks doesn‚Äôt walk backwards, and Sticks HATES setting up her tent in the rain. <br>With each tent site we passed, the already tented campers look more and more surprised that we were hiking past, leaving me more and more convinced that we were making the wrong call. <br>Now I‚Äôm sure that you‚Äôre on the edge of your seat wondering ‚ÄòDid she make it!?‚Äô. <br>You can relax, I did.

It truly is a majestic place, and I could understand why it remains the most visited national park. I waved a bittersweet goodbye to the park, thankful for its beauty, but glad to be beyond the weird rules that it enforced. Besides, my dad always taught me ‚ÄòYou shouldn‚Äôt trust a person that doesn‚Äôt like dogs.‚Äô and the park just doesn‚Äôt allow canines, it‚Äôs biggest downfall. <br>A couple miles in to my last day in the park, I was met by an unsuspected visitor.

If I can live it, you can handle reading it. <br>As my anxiety laden brain worked double time, teaming up with my new fear of bears, I pondered aloud ‚ÄòAre bears like sharks?‚Äô before deciding all google searches would end with my imminent death. <br>More and more women are thru-hiking now, but there still isn‚Äôt enough information out there on how to deal with how with this situation. I‚Äôll spare you the details and tell you, it‚Äôs very carefully. <br>Having crossed the imaginary line where the national park ends, and the lawless forest begins, we got right back to our stealth camp shenanigans. Hidden in the trees, a true diamond in the rough, we found a nice creek side patch of grass to call home. With a healthy water source, and a built it fire ring I deemed it juuuust right for this Goldilocks and her 3 bears. <br>We spent the night drinking hot cocoa. By the fire, and under the stars. We reminisced about where we‚Äôd been and who we‚Äôd met, and we speculated about the days to come. <br>Beautiful day. Beautiful night.

At 8:30 a.m. a sketchy white van showed up, right on schedule and drove us back to the mountains. An on-time hiker shuttle is an anomaly, and a true indicator that you should probably stop and buy a lottery ticket. <br>The second half of the Smokies is what you should imagine everyday to be like if you are trying to convince yourself that thru-hiking is for you. It was a beautiful day, filled with lots of ridge walking, and panoramic views around every single corner. When I had imagined the AT, this is what I had imagined anyway, as opposed to the endless amount of mountain climbing which has been my reality. Now I know what you‚Äôre thinking... it‚Äôs a mountain range. Yeah, I get that now, but I‚Äôve been in elevators less vertical than some of the climbs North Carolina put me through. <br>My hiker paranoia set in strong, as there has been lots of recent bear activity leading to shelter closures, and it‚Äôs been all anyone can talk about. When I reached camp, I mentioned my new found fear of bears to which another hiker said ‚Äòyou‚Äôre only recently afraid of bears?‚Äô <br>I promptly responded, ‚ÄòBears aren‚Äôt really a huge problem in the metropolitan area of Seattle and while I‚Äôve spent countless hours of my life dedicated to fearing the irrational, bears shockingly enough had previously never made it that high on the list.‚Äô <br>Due to the shelter closures, we ended up bottle necked with a HUGE group of hikers. <br>So here we were, Coachella round two and I was pretty sure one of these dummies around us was going to get us eaten by bears. But, I‚Äôve lived to tell the tale, so I guess it all ended up alright. <br><br>#atnobo2021 #appalachiantrail #thruhike #thruhikingwomen #womeninrecovery #womenwhothruhike #appalachiantrailclassof2021 #odaat #nofilter #nofilterneeded #optoutside #soberlife"

The last stretch from Erwin, TN to just past Damascus, VA gave us a little taste of everything; we went from hot and humid, to snow, to windstorms through the night, to people snoring at the hostel which might be the worst. And I could be wrong, but the trail feels a bit more mellow lately allowing us to knock out huge miles more consistently! We did 70 miles in the past 3 days and it has felt SO GOOD. <br>....<br>This stretch we did take 3 zero and 2 near zero mile days to give Double Down's foot some time to heal. She's dealing with a nasty bout of plantar fasciitis which then takes a bit of a mental toll as we have had to take it easier than we'd like. She is a very strong hiker but the best decision really was to take it easy and let her body heal. Between her feet and my knees, this trail has not been easy on our bodies.<br>....<br>So up next we will be hiking to mile 637 Pearisburg, VA. There are so many towns in-between here and there that's it's just sort of a logistical nightmare, so our plan is to just carry a ton of food and try to do big miles. Any time you get off trail to go into town It's hard to get back to hiking. Well, for me when there's a bar it's tough. üòÇ Life is good!<br>....<br>One sort of weird thing I've noticed out here is the culture is so different from the other two trails! It's a much more laid back atmosphere than the CDT but I think this trail sort of holds your hand in a way? So many hostels and towns that I got to shower 3x in 5 days! Plus slackpacking (paying someone to carry your stuff further ahead) is so prevalent out here that sometimes it feels like we're the only ones not doing it in this bubble. I get so jealous when I see people sprinting past me while I'm trudging up a hill with my pack but I'm so stubborn that I refuse to do it. I guess I haven't done it yet so why start now but it's so damn tempting! üòÇ Maybe I'll pay someone to carry a rack of beer ahead for me or something. <br>....<br>#at2021 #appalachiantrail2021 #appalachiantrail #atnobo2021 #wearealladventurers #thruhike #thruhiking #backpackingadventures #hikingadventure #hikertrash #getoutside #getlost #wildeast #appalachianmountains"

He buys me an alcoholic drink at the local health food store and we get lucky and find out that there‚Äôs one restaurant open around the corner. I get my burger and all is right with the world.

We start with a morning ridge walk and the weather quickly turns. Weather reports indicate intense wind warnings mixed with rain/thunder/lightning.

Another warm day but easy hiking. Nice to do shorter miles after yesterday‚Äôs 23. Crossed the 600 mile mark, saw two beautiful black racer king snakes, Steve at Jenny Knob shelter, more beautiful Virginia farmland, crossing Kimberling Creek and some trail magic thanks to River, a former thru hiker headed out west for the summer. Jersey on the left and Whisper on the right. <br>‚Ä¢<br>Today was a good day. I have had a shower and am massively full thanks to a BBQ dinner at Weary Feet Hostel. Julie is a fantastic host and I highly recommend staying here for all hikers. Lovely place. House was built in 1910. Sitting around talking with a few hikers now waiting for my laundry to finish in the dryer. Planning to hike out tomorrow and get to Pearisburg by Sunday. <br>‚Ä¢<br>As I said in yesterday‚Äôs post, southwest Virginia really is amazing. It‚Äôs an incredibly gorgeous place. I have been blown away with the scenery and the people. It‚Äôs been super warm but temps should be cooler by Sunday. The high ridges don‚Äôt have any leaves on the trees, so we‚Äôre hiking in the blazing sun most of the day. Ready for either shade or cooler weather!

We are at this point in the hike where the herd has thinned a bit and you have a pretty good idea of who is ahead of you, and who is behind you. Dumbfounded, and exhausted, I blurted out ‚Äòwho the heck are all THESE people?‚Äô. With a smarmy grin and a nod of the head the boys looked at me and said in unison ‚ÄòDay hikers‚Äô. <br>Annoyed with the now Coachella-esque atmosphere I found myself in, I felt my first tinge of thru-hiker false superiority. In reality everyone was perfectly pleasant, but it was very bizarre to see so many people in our weird little space. <br>Somewhere with my days  I goofed, and today is day 21. The goal for the day was Gatlinburg and rain was promised in the forecast. <br>I climbed up to Clingmans Dome, a monument that unintentionally marks mile 200, and is the highest point of elevation on the Appalachian trail. As you can see the view was, well, I was in a cloud.<br>They say ‚Äòit‚Äôs all down hill from here‚Äô. <br>A fun but false statement, as I definitely made several more climbs that day to reach Newfound Gap. <br>At the gap I crossed into my third state and I‚Äôve now reached Tennessee! <br>I hitched into Gatlinburg, a town with a bizzaro juxtaposition to the the wilderness I had just been walking through. <br>As we held our hotel keys, in this sunny, bright, baby Vegas of a city we talked about how only 3 hours ago we were wet, cold, and hiking in the rain. <br>As the hole in my shoe grows, and my sleeping pads ability to hold air decreases, this will probably be a very expensive but necessary zero. <br>I‚Äôm known amongst my team for being staunchly anti-zero day, and I cannot wait to keep hiking.<br>At the same time...

Besides, I figure I‚Äôve done far riskier things with my body and managed to survive. <br>The view was the morale boost I needed. <br>I was so far behind the gang, but once I conceded to the fact that I may be tenting in the dark, the day became much easier. <br>I dropped all of the hurry, and just strolled my way through the evening, stopping to remind myself that I was in a National Park and that this was fucking cool. <br>I made it before dark, and all was well. <br><br>#appalachiantrail #atnobo2021 #thruhiking #womeninrecovery #appalaciantrailclassof2021 #womenwhothruhike #thruhikingwomen #smokiemountains"

The trail was lined with snow covered Rhododendron. It looked as if we were traveling through a mystical, snow covered rain forest. We took a short lunch break at Curley Maple Gap Shelter. Stopping made the cold even more noticeable, so I could tell the next couple of days would be long ones. We continued our hike to Beauty Spot, where we originally planned on camping. There were breath taking, snowy mountain view‚Äôs from all sides, but with the wind, it was far too cold to camp. We left Beauty Spot frozen to the core, after being there for less than 5 minutes. We stealth camped a couple miles up the trail by a spring. We all doubled up in tents because the temperature dropped down to 5 degrees. <br>Day 34 (20.6 miles): We woke up to frigid temperatures and struggled to get ourselves out of our tents. With an exception to the cold, the hike was beautiful. The snow covered alpine vegetation, glistening in the sun, reminded me of the mountains of the Adirondacks and Catskills in New York. We only took brief breaks because we had a late start to our day, and we wanted to stay warm. The final 3 mile climb up to Ash Gap was brutal, after a long day of hiking. We reached our campsite right as the sun was setting. I was proud to have finished a long day with a lot of elevation gain, but I was exhausted. <br><br>#appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #atnobo2021 #atnobo #atthruhiker #winterhiking #snowymountains #coldaf #hikingadventures #appalachiantrail2021"

The hiking was gorgeous and trail well-graded, but the weather conditions are what will make it stand out in my mind! I don't normally post about a single day but I love all of these memories from two days ago so üíÉ.<br>....<br>The previous day we bailed out to a road and caught a ride to town just due to how miserably cold it was; we both carry enough gear to survive it but it still doesn't mean it's any fun. After a night of fun with other hikers we got back to the trail around 9:30am and were greeted by freezing temps (no big deal). As we got higher and higher up, the trail was soon completely covered by ice slowing our mileage way down as every step has to be thought about. By the time we got to the top the weather reports had it under 10¬∞ F with wind chill, which I believe because my buff was frozen around my face and my beard had icicles growing! Truly one of my coldest days I've had on any of the trails as I wore all of my layers for most of the day.<br>....<br>Eventually you get over Roan Mtn and find yourself at Carver Gap which is a beautiful series of balds! I would like to come back when the wind isn't so severe and I can relax and just soak in the views. The wind was pushing Double Down and I all over the trail but it was üòç. In the end we managed just over 21 miles in 8 1/2 hours of hiking, which we were both really proud of with the trail conditions being what they were! This is the first place I'm putting down on the list of places I have to come back to!<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#at2021 #appalachiantrail2021 #appalachiantrail #atnobo2021 #at #wearealladventurers #thruhike #thruhiking #backpackingadventures #hikingadventure #hikertrash #getoutside #getlost #wildeast #appalachianmountains #hiking #tennessee"

When we finally got a start to the day, we were surprised by a beautiful climb along Sugar Loaf Branch. We then took a long lunch break in a meadow, looking out at Big Bald. It was exciting to finally take a break in the sun after the rainy weather the past couple of days. We continued our days hike to High Rock, where we briefly stopped for a view of the ridge we had been hiking for the past couple of days. We ended our day in a meadow about 4 miles short of Big Bald. We cooked dinner and laid in our sleeping bags, as we watched the sun set. <br>Day 31 (22.5 miles): @max_marwin (Aqua Dog), @lucyburgoyne (Chef), and I decided to hike all the way to Erwin, while the rest of the tramily hiked the 16.5 miles to No Business Knob Shelter. The three of us had a pretty late start because we didn‚Äôt decide to lengthen our day until it was already 9:30 (right as we were leaving camp). Our first exciting view of the day was on Big Bald, which gave us an outstanding 360 degree view of the surrounding mountains. It felt as if we were on top of the word. We stopped at High Rocks (different from High Rock), for a quick lunch. Our moral was low, because it was approaching mid-afternoon and we still had half of our mileage to go. Luckily, we received trail magic from Ms. Frizzle at Spivey Gap. The magic filled our tummies and brightened our spirits. The rest of the hike gave us our first sight of budding trees and views of the Nolichucky River. When we finally reached our hotel, we celebrated with delivery pizza. We were excited to take our first zero in Erwin the next day! <br>Day 32 (0 miles): We regrouped with the rest of our tramily and spent the day relaxing in Erwin.

The morning of day 13 we rushed to Newfound Gap for a hitch (for resupply) where we discovered that the road was closed for wind advisory.

When we left the hostel, I was feeling antsy, so I continued onwards to the top of Snowbird Mountain, while the rest of the group stopped at a campsite on the way up. As I reached the summit of Snowbird, the sun set, and I was given a beautiful view of the stars.<br>Day 24 (8 miles): I woke up early to my tent being blown over by heavy winds. Luckily, Snowbird Mountain had a beautiful sunrise view, so I relaxed as I waited for my tramily to catch up. As a group, we hiked to GroundHog Creek Shelter where we had a long lunch break. We finished the day by hiking to the summit of Max Patch, which had an outstanding 360 degree view of mountains. We ate dinner as the sunset and got into our tents right before it started to rain. <br>Day 25 (16.7 miles): I woke up on the summit of Max Patch to another beautiful view.

We continued north down the AT to Deer Park Mountain Shelter, where we saw an Owl and spent the night. I felt exhausted by the time I went to bed, but looked forward to relaxing in Hot Springs the next day. <br>Day 26 (3.1 miles): I woke up feeling super congested and fatigued. I realized that I had been feeling a little bit under the weather due to allergies. Spring was starting and North Carolina is known for having especially bad pollen. We hiked into Hot Springs, where I was able to get allergy medicine and relax. <br><br>#appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #smokiemountains #standingbearfarm #atnobo #atnobo2021 #hikingadventures #atthruhike #thruhike"

We are currently just past in Erwin, TN, at mile 344.8! For now, I want to share a game we play on trail... Because we don't have live TV, we make our own Bachelorette contestants that we think would win on the show. Tell us who you'd pick to give a rose to! Gonna keep who made who anonymous, but these really are our first two we made on trail and we want bragging rights. PLEASE VOTE IN COMMENTS BY LIKING THE NAME<br><br>Jeffrey Shirley Davidson is our first contestant. His grandfather created the Harley Davidson brand and while he is wealthy, he has left his easy life to build hospitals and schools in impoverished areas around the world. In his free time, he plays live chess on Twitch for thousands of people who continue to donate to his cause of helping around the world; this is perfect because he can build during the day then live stream at night. Jeff has so many followers because he is caring as well as very charismatic. He will take over as CEO of the Harley Davidson company when his family passes it down to him. For now he rides up to Bachelorette mansion on a Harley and says ""You make my heart go vroom vroom,"" gives her a hug then heads inside.<br><br>Bentley Michael Andrews is our second contestant. He's a humble, hunky granny smith apple farmer, whose large biceps help him carry more apples at a time than any other apple farmer. In his spare time he enjoys making gourmet sandwiches, one of which won him the coveted Guy Fieri Hot Sandwich Standard of Excellence Award 2019 with his smoked bacon, granny smith, arugula, and cheese ""2 Gouda 2 be True"" sandwich. Bentley enjoys whittling small ornamental spoons with the trimmed branches from his orchard. He arrives at Bachelorette mansion with a picnic basket of apples, sandwiches, and spoons, and says ""I heard an apple a day keeps the other contestants away, and I've got a whole orchard.""<br>...<br>#at2021 #appalachiantrail2021 #appalachiantrail #atnobo2021 #at #wearealladventurers #thruhike #thruhiking #backpackingadventures #hikingadventure #hikertrash #getlost #wildeast #thebachelor #greatsmokymountains"

The weather had reported storms starting at 5:30 in the morning, so waking up dry was a real treat. With a couple milestones ahead, we left camp early and eager.  The air was so muggy and hot all day I found myself wishing for a little bit of rain. I quickly pushed that thought out of my head trying not to manifest disaster upon myself. <br>We reached the border and we were done with our first state. Stopped to take an awkward family photo and moved forward to lunch. <br>IF you‚Äôre following along, I did a serious cost benefit analysis of carrying pickles with me at lunchtime and decided they were great while they lasted, but not worth the carry. I do however enjoy slamming the 4oz of left over pickle juice and exclaiming ‚Äòleave no trace, bitches!‚Äô ‚Äî and unnecessary but gratifying move. <br>North Carolina met me with two very unforgiving climbs, and a nice pelting of rain. The rain felt good after sweating all day, but all I could think about was setting my tent up in it. I again pushed that thought from my mind, as it was future Annie‚Äôs problem, and instead enjoyed the rain for the relief that it brought from the thick muggy air. <br>When I finally reached the gap, .8 miles from camp there were the 2 guys and a shuttle. They were tossing around the idea of going into town, and honestly I wasn‚Äôt too hard to convince. <br>2 of the 3 of us are injured.<br>We ran into one of our other trail friends we hadn‚Äôt seen in a few days who had already arranged the shuttle for himself.<br>We were able to get a piggy back rate on the shuttle and we booked a room at the classiest establishment Franklin has to offer. At 50$ a night, we found ourselves at The Sapphire Inn. <br>It was a hard choice for me to go into town, but all for the wrong reasons. <br>When I thought about why I wanted to keep hiking, I was only comparing myself to other hikers, and not thinking about my body.  The gangs also been together since Gooch Gap, and I wasn‚Äôt ready to break up.<br>So with bellies full of Mexican food, we sit in Franklin, and wait out the storm. <br>#atnobo2021 #appalachiantrail #atthruhike2021 #womenwhohike #hikerlife"

We are now past mile 250 on the AT and have finished Georgia AND the Great Smoky Mountains National Park up in Tennessee/North Carolina! This last stretch was really beautiful and I can see why this is the most visited national park. We faced some of the least fun weather of the hike so far, but that's what bourbon is for! There have been some fun trail towns at least.<br>....<br>We nero'd into Gatlinburg only doing 5 trail miles... well, I should say we tried to only do 5 miles but when we got to the trailhead we discovered that the road was closed due to weather conditions. So that means we had to road walk the 15 miles into town (fortunately some kids who were trapped in the park gave us a ride on their way out saving us a few miles). Once we were there we got a bit vortexed by the food and drinks and took a zero mile day, which was so fun and very worth it! Gatlinburg is a very touristy town and PACKED with maskless dorks, but it's cheesey fun and I'd probably go back some other time. <br>....<br>That town was just overwhelming so it feels good to be back on trail! Yesterday was a 23 mile day which really felt like nothing. The temps have been freezing and there's ice covering the trail. Actually, the trees are covered in ice too so when wind blows through huge chunks fall from branches and we have to cover our heads. üòÇ<br>....<br>So our current plan is to be in Virginia within the next two weeks. Elevation doesn't seem crazy and we have some pretty steady goals. My knee feels great and we are hitting a good level of working through the arguments we have as siblings!

When we reached the shelter at the end of the of day, we were informed by a ridge runner that the road into Gatlinburg, where we planned on getting our next resupply,  was closed due to poor weather. This meant that we would have to hike an additional 11 miles the next day to get more food. <br>Day 20 (10.5 miles): We woke up at 5:00 am, hoping to make it to Gatlinburg in time for dinner. This was our first time so far hiking in the dark and hiking in the snow, so it was quite exciting! As the sun rose, we continued hiking down the winter wonderland that was the trail. One of the most notable parts of this section was Clingman‚Äôs Dome, which is the highest point in elevation on the AT and marked the 200th mile of the AT. As usual, it was very exciting to reach another big milestone!

Yesterday it was 70¬∞ and we dodged thunderstorms and sunshine. Rain all night last night. Winter came back with somewhat of a vengeance today. Snow on the ground going up and over Camp Creek Bald. Zero views on Big Firescald Knob. Sometimes all you can control is yourself. Laughter is key. Stopped for lunch at Jerry‚Äôs Cabin and I‚Äôm pretty sure I was mildly hypothermic by the time I started hiking again. It was rough hiking in cold rain in the clouds all day. As I trotted up a hill to warm up and regain feeling in my fingers, I made an impulse decision to push past the shelter end point for the day and instead get picked up at Devil Fork Gap to sleep inside at Nature‚Äôs Inn hostel. Taft is a good fella who runs a nice spot. I‚Äôm inside, dry, warm and everything is drying out. Hostel stay #ftw today.<br>‚Ä¢<br>Yesterday, on the back side of Rich Mountain, I experienced something amazing. Just before I got to the side trail to the observation tower, a thunderstorm rolled in. Other than Albert Mountain and Wayah Bald, I have missed out on views at many of the towers out here. So I was bummed to miss a view but hiked on. After the storm passed, I was on the back side of Rich Mountain and saw a rainbow in a hollow no more than 100 yards from me. And when I turned around, the trees were like glass with water dripping everywhere. It was beautiful and hard to put into words, but it was perhaps the most spiritually moving moment of my trip so far. I was crying tears of joy for sure. <br>‚Ä¢<br>There is indeed a great spirit in these mountains, but the weather is also like a petulant child screaming PAY ATTENTION TO ME!! nearly all the time. The last 48 hours proved that to be more than true.<br>‚Ä¢<br>Enjoying a dry night with my friend Rapture in the hostel. Good night to all!<br>‚Ä¢<br>What a gift it is to be out here!"

My 10-day break from hiking to go home and coach my @ncfc_youth 03 Gold DCH G team in the @nc_youthsoccer Kepner Cup tournament unfortunately ended yesterday with a 2-1 loss in the semifinals to a solid @wcwaasoccer 02 Black G team.<br>‚Ä¢<br>I am excited to return to hiking but equally sad to not see the team make it to the final match. I wanted that so badly for this group. Despite my sadness, I am so proud of these young women who gave their best all season. In tears after the game yesterday, a player said, ‚ÄúThat was our first loss all season!‚Äù I was completely blown away by the observation, but it was true. The team finished in first place in @nc_youthsoccer 1st East Division with a 6-0-2 record. We went 3-0 last weekend at prelims and had our eyes on a title this weekend. Sadly that dream won‚Äôt be realized, but again I am so grateful for this team, the players and this season. The players were fantastic. This season was marked by lots of hard work and a dedication to get better and do all we could to play as a solid unit. The best part about this year was how grounding these ladies were for each other and for me as their coach during Covid and all of the insanity the pandemic brought to our lives over the past year. I looked forward to every training session, knowing the team could be together, laugh, talk, work hard and foster their love of the game. Most of the players attended school virtually, so I know many used practice as an opportunity to reconnect with friends and decompress from a day in front of a screen. I know I did. <br>‚Ä¢<br>Sadly, as many of the players on our team are seniors, yesterday was the final match for this group. Thank you so much ladies - for everything. Thank you to the parents who afforded me the trust to mentor their daughters. The list of parents who played key roles this season and in previous years is massive. Particular thanks to @decooke1 and @jsa01450 for their help as team manager and with our team finances. I‚Äôm so grateful for this group and for this season.

Well, it's really cold at night and my knees aren't doing so hot but other than that, life is good. This trail isn't what I expected at all and that's fine; there are less views and more elevation, but the magic of this trail is the history of the ground you walk on.

I only hiked 2.5 miles from Fontana marina to the entrance sign to the @greatsmokynps on the far side of Fontana dam. I said goodbye to Thinker, Einstein, Brien, Tumbelina and Farmadillo as they headed into the Smokies. Very hard to do, but I have some important unfinished business with my @ncfc_youth 03 Gold DCH G club soccer team. <br>‚Ä¢<br>I‚Äôve coached some of these outstanding young ladies since they were 11-12 years old, others since high school and a few just in the past 1-2 years. Like my #AT hiking crew, they are important to me. I have become friends with their parents, who in return have afforded me their trust to coach and mentor their daughters to be better soccer players and better people. As for the ladies, we‚Äôve been together through wins and losses, triumph and sadness. I‚Äôve believed in their potential and they have believed in me as their coach. It has been such a privilege to work with them and it is absolutely worth it, in my mind, to get off trail for what could be up to 10 days as we try to bring home a  @nc_youthsoccer President‚Äôs Kepner Cup trophy. Long story short, we will return to our regular programming after a brief break from hiking action to go coach the team. Let‚Äôs do this, ladies!<br>‚Ä¢<br>As for returning to the AT, I would be lying if I did not admit I have concerns about the hiker bubble behind us as well as how much I miss my friends, who are now officially ahead of me. I‚Äôm thinking I may bypass part or all of the Smokies to stay ahead of the huge amount of hikers behind me. Avoiding crowds is a big reason why I came out here in February. My plan now is to jump ahead and resume walking to Maine. I‚Äôve been thinking about how special it might be to come back to NC, SOBO the Smokies and walk across Fontana Dam into the arms of friends and loved ones to celebrate the end of my thru hike later this year (NC is my home so my peeps are nearby). So for now, that‚Äôs the plan. Life throws curve balls, and if this trail has taught me anything so far, it is that flexibility and adaptability are critical to long term success. So I plan to leave the trail tomorrow and, with the help of friends, I‚Äôll be back soon. Stay tuned!"

Appalachian Trail update: I did about 35 days on the Appalachian Trail last Fall/Winter, covering most of central Virginia, southwest Virginia, and Tennessee. The year before I did about a month in Vermont and Massachusetts, and about a month in Pennsylvania, Maryland, and West Virginia. In 2018 I did about a month total scattered throughout Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, and Maine, including Katahdin. I'm also using a double-back technique, so the whole hike will be a yo-yo when complete, and will take 3 years. Right now I'm doing some remote sections in North Georgia, including Tray Mountain Wilderness and Blood Mountain Wilderness. Even though I lived in Atlanta for 35 years, I never did the North Georgia sections. They're more easily said than done, as Blood Mountain and Tray Mountain involve rugged terrain and extreme elevation gain. The terrain here is just as high and just as difficult as anything in Virginia or Tennessee, with several peaks over 4,500 feet. I'm taking advantage of a brief window of good weather this week to do some grueling sections through remote wilderness, before another round of storms forecast to hit this weekend. Although I can report that the north Georgia mountains are free of snow, and most of western North Carolina is also free of snow.<br>#appalachiantrail #helenga #travelblogger #travelphotography #naturephotography #landscapephotography #solotravel #vanlife #solotraveler #travelblog #chattahoocheenationalforest #northgeaorgia #dahlonega #dahlonegaga #appalachiantrailnobo #atnobo2021"

Check out his profile @williamrhyne for details. <br>‚Ä¢<br>@chicaandsunsetshostel is a fantastic place. I can‚Äôt say enough positives about Chica and Sunsets as individuals and their business. The AT has some hostels with quite the reputation; this one is absolutely the opposite. Run by former thru hikers who see the value of a ‚Äúwelcome home‚Äù type of stay, in combination with their support of the local economy of Franklin, has made for a wonderful visit. 100% recommend this 5-star experience to all thru hikers! We also spent some time at @outdoor_76 where we signed the 2021 banner and Gangster got some solid shoe advice. Hate to not be hiking on this gorgeous day but listening to our bodies is important. Also I love @backpacker_comics artwork - one of my favorite hikers too!<br>‚Ä¢<br>Thank you again to @chicaandsunsetshostel for a lovely stay. Franklin is a fantastic place as well.
