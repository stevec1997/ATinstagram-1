As the memories fade from the mind, we find ourselves reminiscing with each other, combing through old images, and reaching out to friends made along the way so as not to forget what a wonderful adventure we had and the wisdom we took from our walk in the woods. While nothing compares to the actual experience of living it, it has been awesome to watch as this next crop of hopeful hikers embarks from the arch at Amicalola Falls in Georgia, many not understanding how much this experience will enrich their lives. We are so excited (and yes, jealous) of their respective journeys through forests, fields, and self.<br><br>And as we discuss how grateful we are for the opportunity to walk through this magnificent country of ours, we are reminded that choosing to do so opened our eyes to the shared experience of being human. The trail taught us to forego judgement, embrace each other, live with love, and to lead with curiosity rather than caution.<br><br>This sentiment - dangerously underrepresented in most of what we see and hear nowadays - is captured eloquently (of course) in a few stanzas of Maya Angelou's poem, Human Family:<br><br>I note the obvious differences<br>between each sort and type,<br>but we are more alike, my friends,<br>than we are unalike.<br><br>We are more alike, my friends,<br>than we are unalike.<br><br>We are more alike, my friends,<br>than we are unalike.<br><br>Good luck to the AT class of 2020!

There's a bright red line painted halfway through the bridge, marking the park's boundary. Soon after is the kiosk where thru hikers sign up for one of the 12 spots at the Birches. The park rules are also listed. After barely having any on the AT, it's odd to have so many to remember and follow. ‚Ä¢<br>Then I'm off. I hike down a really flat, nice trail for a bit.

I set up my stuff in the shelter and eat lunch. I pull out my yellow plastic card that was handed back to me with my yellow paper slip. On the card, I'm officially thru hiker #1033. At Amicalola Falls, I was #2371. It's insane to me. Out of all the people that registered at Amicalola Falls, over half haven't made it this far yet. I'm sure the number is higher since not everyone registers at Amicalola when they start, and just begin right at Springer Mt. ‚Ä¢<br>The rest of the group trickles in.

On the trail, there was nothing holding you back from experiencing everything in life that is truly important. Being present, self-care, working hard toward something you really care about (because it wasn't imposed on you... YOU CHOSE IT), quality human interaction, exercise, the wellness of yourself and the people around you, joy. But in society, we spend most of our time thinking about where we need to be and when, what needs to get done, how much money we need to make and how, how to limit our spending so we can survive, politics and  updating licenses and paying things by their due dates and simply just keeping our heads above water. And we try to squeeze the important things into the margins. I know why people are happier on the trail. Because the trail is real life. This? It's just a game we made up. It's time for a perspective shift. I can't try to force trail life into my civilized life. And I can't jump into society as I knew it before the trail- because I am different now. But I CAN color my current life with what I learned on the AT. I know how to embrace suck. I know how to be happy with what I have. I know how to measure success by my personal best and not the best of the person next to me. I know how to shine when it's raining. I know how to push when I'm tired. I know how to see beauty where it lies. I can do this. You can do this. .<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #appalachianthruhike #atclassof2019 #atnobo #atnobo2019 #thruhike #optoutside #hikerhunger #hikertrash #appalachiantrail2019 #hikerfeed #posttraillife #posttraildepression"

The Champ carries a World Heavyweight Wrestling Champion's belt on the trail.  He's been a wrestling fan for a long time and thought the belt would make for some cool pictures along the trail at important and interesting places.  I'm not a huge wrestling fan, but I have to agree, it did make for some fun and interesting pictures!  The Champ comes from North Carolina and started his NOBO thru-hike on March 21st.  He's been taking his time and enjoying the trail, so he decided to flip up to Maine after finishing CT to make sure he doesn't run out of time before Katahdin closes in about a month.  So about 10 days ago he summited Katahdin and is now hiking south to finish his thru-hike.

It happened to be Little Jo and with his guitar.  He used to keep it in it's official case, but that kind of made it look like he had a rife strapped to his pack, so switched to just bubble wrap part way in as it was freaking people out.  Little Jo had previously attempted a thru-hike in 2016, he had started that hike with a banjo, but part way into his hike he sent the banjo home when he got this smaller Martin backpacker guitar.  As he meets people along his journey he often has people sign his guitar.  After taking some photos I gladly signed it too. Not only is it impressive to be trekking the AT, but doing it with a musical instrument is even more impressive.  Little Jo took to the trail this year on March 30th for his second NOBO thru-hike attempt, I have faith he'll make it this year.

After all the beautiful days in Vermont and heading into NH, rain, cold and fog would block any of the beautiful scenery  from sight. Was heading down Mt. Lafayette on a rainy, foggy morning and took my first major fall since North Carolina üò≥. Everything was wet from the rain that morning and was taking it slow and steady, but just happened to step on that one tree root and my foot got out from under me. Went pack first down hill between a rock and a log, sliding down the log until my pack wedged enough to stop me, which was awesome cause a had a 2 foot drop coming up. Gotta thank my pack for always having mu back, literally and figuratively üòÇ. Banged my calf pretty good and a few scratches on the elbow, felt like i had a huge knot in my calf for the rest of the day, i just walked it out üòâ. I‚Äôve been noticing that most of the effort in the whites isn‚Äôt the uphill, but the downhill. As long as i keep a good slow and steady pace uphill it‚Äôs manageable. The trouble lies with the down hill. Climbing down boulders, down smooth rock faces where one little piece of dirt between your shoe and the rock could send you sliding down 10 to 20 feet into another boulder ü§™. After twi days on Franconia ridge, literally as I‚Äôm coming down the ridge. The clouds start to part and sun starts to show and finally get to see the beauty that has been blocked for two days.

He‚Äôs from central Ohio and walking the AT to decompress after retiring from Honda. He started on April 7th and even though he runs half marathons he feels the Trail is the most challenging thing he‚Äôs ever done. However in so many other ways it is also the most rewarding thing he has ever done. His plan for the next few weeks is to leave his tramily and push the pace to get to Rutland in Vermont. He‚Äôs then going to drive home for the birth of his third grandchild and spend a few days at home with the new baby. Then it‚Äôs back to the trail where he hopes to meet up with his tramily so that he can finish the trail with them. <br>Congratulations Hobo, have a safe drive and we look forward to seeing you on the trail again very soon üì∏ @jane_haslam_photography<br>@jules.hikes<br>.<br>. #appalachiantrail #harlemvalley #hikerportrait . .<br>. <br>#makeportraits #pawling #pawlingny #hudsonvalley #photoshoot #makeportraitsnotwar #harlemvalleyatcommunity @harlemvalleyatcommunity @nynjtc @iloveny #upstateny @appalachiantrail  #trailmagic #humansofnewyork #dutchesscounty  #environmentalportrait #neverstopexploring  #nikonnofilter #athiker #appalachiantrail2019 #appalachiantrailconservancy #edwardrmurrowpark @appalachianmountainclub @georgiatomaine @appalachian.trail #athiker2019 #atnobo2019 #trektheat #appalachiantrailthruhike @dutchesstourism #wildeast #hitthetrail #grandparentswhohike"

Had some nice views from the top though. Had an old fire tower to get above tree line. Could see Mt Moosilauke off in the distance, which will be the start of the EPIC climbs ü•µ. Had lunch up top and talked to a few hikers. Headed down the backside of Smart and headed right back up Mt Cube. A rocky, rooty, steep SOB but with another great view. Stopped and chatted with a few more hikers and found out we all started this adventure within 2 days of each other. Also connected with a girl i had camped with on day 2 of this hike. Crazy to think its been over 4 months now. Headed down Mt Cube and crossed over Brackett Brook. The original plan was to head up 4 more miles to Ore Hill Campsite but found some nice tent sites right along the brook. Everyone else decided to stay here also, legs were done.

By this point, I knew it was going to happen somewhere south of Katahdin. I knew my feet couldn't handle it much longer. I remember this moment so potently. I can still faintly feel it when I think of it, like the aftertaste that is left in your mouth after a bitter bite. My feet were pounding with white hot pain. The back of my knee was tender to the touch. My stomach was growling. My head was light and spinning. And my heart felt like a water balloon, sinking deeper and deeper into my stomach with every passing moment as we waited for a navy blue Honda Odyssey to pick us up. It is nearly impossible to describe the magnetism of the trail, the pull it has on your heart, constantly toward itself. There is a reason hikers will persist past the point of common sense. Through broken ribs. Through Morton's neuroma. Through bone spurs and fractures and giardia. It's because, to you, getting off trail is synonymous with ""going home."" But to us, it's synonymous with ""leaving home."" Everything about walking through that mountain air, suffering through that weather, hiking past the cicadas and sleeping with the mice, it feels natural and right. Going to Walmart and driving to work and having conversations with people when you aren't sure if they really mean what they're saying- that doesn't. Today Blue and I put our bare feet on some grass to get the slightest tinge of that feeling back. The thought of sleeping outside again feels like a deep breath after spending too many seconds underwater. People say the trail will ""ruin your life."" They aren't being dramatic. What they are trying to say is that now, and maybe for the rest of your life, you're going to feel a little homesick. But man. It was worth every second of suck.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #appalachianthruhike #atclassof2019 #atnobo #atnobo2019 #thruhike #optoutside #hikerhunger #hikertrash #appalachiantrail2019 #hikerfeed #lifeafterthetrail #posttrail #posttraildepression #postthruhike"

It happened at 745am complete with cake, singing, and of course bananas.  It made me realize that soon I'll be back to real life where birthday parties don't happen at 745am, cake for breakfast isn't healthy, and the booze we consumed before noon would qualify us as derelicts according to most.  I really can't fathom returning to the real world just yet, but that's okay because I have 800 miles to figure that out...

Why, you ask?<br><br>We've had the privilege of hiking two of the most storied long distance hiking trails in the country, as the Vermont Long Trail (est. 1930) overlaps with the Appalachian Trail (est. 1937) for slightly over 100 miles. We've seen amazing sights from mountains like Stratton, Killington, and Bromley. We've smelled the familiar pine, walked through old growth forests, drank the purest and coldest of water, eaten crab apples more sour than any candy, and have indulged all the joys of life in the woods - even finding the silver lining as we were getting drenched by rain this morning. Sometimes this trail delivers the lowest of lows and forces you to confront an ugly version of yourself, but our spirits in Vermont have been lifted higher than the towering hardwoods surrounding us as we walk. <br>A special thanks to our friend and fellow hiker ""Roll On"" (@petershambo ) on behalf of the many hikers whose spirits he lifted with his kindness and cheerfulness this past week. He and his wife Gail are the epitome of ""trail angels"". Thanks also to all of you, whose support and encouragement means more than can be conveyed.

Ate 2 footlong subs from subway, charged up the electronics and got a new water filter. For the past month the mini has gradually gotten to be a pain in the butt, so a new one was desperately needed. Headed out of town about 4:30pm, quickly got a hitch back to the trailhead and began the climb up Bromley Mtn. There‚Äôs a sky patrol building on top that allows thru hikers to stay the night, even has a restroom, üòÇ. As long as the wind stays down and the rain stays away it‚Äôs going to be a good night.

The Vermont Long Trail had an event called ‚Äúhike the long trail in a day‚Äù. Every 15-20 miles along the trail they set up trail magic to help support the event, us AT hikers got to reap some of those benefits, ü§™. Could always tell a LT hiker between a AT hiker, the packs were new and shiny, üòÇ. Got stopped with some trail magic about noon, just in time for lunch. The Connecticut chapter of the green mountain hiking club had set up a nice refueling spot for hikers. Sat and talked to some great people for about 30 minutes then headed out to begin the climb. From here it was a 1200 ft climb up Stratton Mtn, legs were feeling good and wasn‚Äôt too steep so it went by pretty quick. Got to the top and had about 20 people waiting to head up the fire tower. There was a hotel and restaurant on top of the Mtn so it was busy. Took some awesome pictures on the fire tower then headed down the north side to Stratton Pond Campsite about 3.2 miles downhill. Got to the campsite next to Stratton pond, in Minnesota this would be a lake, much bigger than a pond. Had to pay $5 to camp here but it was worth it, had a beautiful view of the ‚Äúlake‚Äù from my site. Vermont is shaping up to be my favorite state yet.

Iron Will has one of the craziest stories I've heard about grit and determination.  He took to the trail on February 16th in GA with his brother.  Part way into his hike he slipped on some ice and broke his femur.  He knew he was hurt but didn't think it was broken and hiked for about another 150 miles before he was convinced to get it checked out.  After they discovered it was broken he got off trail and rehabbed for about 6 weeks.  Then he went up to NH to get back on trail with his brother and they hiked and summited Katahdin together.  Then started hiking SOBO from NH back down to where he got off trail with the broken leg.  Seems like nothing can stop Iron Will from completing his 2019 thru-hike. <br>It was great meeting you Iron Will and hike safe! üì∏Photos by: @justin_goodhart_photography<br>#appalachiantrail #harlemvalley #hikerportrait #doveroak . .<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#makeportraits #nobo #pawling #hudsonvalley  #makeportraitsnotwar #harlemvalleyatcommunity @harlemvalleyatcommunity @nynjtc @iloveny @appalachiantrail  #trailmagic #humansofnewyork #dutchesscounty  #environmentalportrait #neverstopexploring  #nikonnofilter #athiker #appalachiantrail2019 #appalachiantrailconservancy #thetrek @appalachianmountainclub @georgiatomaine @appalachian.trail #athiker2019 #atnobo2019 #trektheat #appalachiantrailthruhike @dutchesstourism #wildeast #ATclassof2019 #whiteblaze #hikehappy #hikeny #ironwill

We can't bring ourselves to put our packs in storage. Or wash them. They are still stinky and leaning against the walls on our respective sides of the bed. We still use our Zpacks wallets. Sunshine is back at work, and her new idea of makeup is sunscreen and chapstick. We are wearing deodorant and feel low-key like a fraud every time we roll it on. We are excited to have our apartment soon, even though we don't have hardly any furniture to put in it. Above all we are thrilled to be back in our friends' daily lives. We are really lucky to have a great group of people in our lives, and we missed them terribly. We have a new love for staying active, which is proven by how many times we've gone trail running or weight lifting or rock climbing or swimming since we've been back home. Our bodies have all kinds of new quirks that make physical activity hard, but if we learned anything on the trail, it was persistence. We still get irritable and anxious when we drive. We still sometimes sit on the ground when we are outside because it didn't even occur to us to use a chair. And we think about our memories and our tramily every single day. Yesterday a cocktail reminded Blue of a specific campfire at Double Springs shelter with our tramily, and it made him teary-eyed. The trail is forever in our hearts. It may feel like a universe far removed from where we are now, but we are still hiker trash. And there isn't a day (or even an hour) that passes where we don't think about the AT.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #appalachianthruhike #atclassof2019 #atnobo #atnobo2019 #thruhike #optoutside #hikerhunger #hikertrash #appalachiantrail2019 #hikerfeed #ATstrong #tramily #memories"

There has been a lot of sun, plenty of thunderstorms, rocks to high heavens, thick shrubbery, and funny encounters with wildlife. Our travels have included a boat, but we mostly trek forward with our feet in our shoes. All 500+ mi of Virginia are now behind me, as are West Virginia, Maryland, (and soon, Pennsylvania). I‚Äôve passed the halfway point (1440th NOBO hiker through Harper‚Äôs Ferry this year) and past mile 1200. I was briefly joined by old housemates from Maitri, and hiked with Medium Salsa (Mark) for 120+ mi, foraging herbs and fungi all along the way. Most nights we saut√©ed chanterelles and chicken of the woods with Perilla leaves. Once Mark returned to DC, I became a solo hiker for the first time in my hike. .<br>In Shenandoah, Bamboo and I got up to higher mileage, eventually doing consecutive 23, 25 mile days! However, I‚Äôve been slowing down recently.<br>.<br>With only two weeks left to hike before departing for a wedding and graduate school, I find myself lingering and savoring the experience while I can. Focusing on ‚Äúsmiles, not miles‚Äù, a fellow hiker‚Äôs motto.

Only three states left, üò≥. Vermont, or better known as Vermud. Known quite well for its pockets of black, slippery mud along this section of the AT. The AT will follow the Vermont Long Trail for 105 miles at which point the AT turns east to head into New Hampshire. <br>Had a beautiful morning at the Bascom Lodge. Breakfast wasn‚Äôt until 8:30am, so i ate some food from the food bag and got back on trail. Most of the morning was downhill into Williamstown, MA. They had a Grocery store about 0.5 miles off trail so i headed over to grab some lunch. Had a decent climb heading out of town, but once i hit the top it was see you later MA and hello Vermont. About 3-4 miles after that i hit the 1600 mile marker. Two big milestones in one day, NICE. Vermud has been living up to its name so far. We haven‚Äôt had allot of rain lately so allot of the big muddy sections are drying out. Rolled into camp about 6:30pm to Congdon Shelter. Have allot of LT (Long Trail) hikers here hiking this section of trail. Dinners about done so i gotta go.

From here it would be a gradual climb over the next 8 miles heading up to Mt Greylock, which is the highest peak in MA. Hiked through some beautiful pine forests and swampy sections. Had a good downpour roll over about 2:30pm but only lasted about 15 minutes, then the sun popped back out. Eventually got to the summit of Mt Greylock (3491ft) and came up on the Massachusetts Veterans War Memorial standing there all beautifully. I went up the spiral staircase inside and tried taking pics but none turned out good, excellent view though. Staying the night at Bascom Lodge which is right on top of Mt Greylock.

CT and MA have been pretty strict on thru hikers camping along the trail. Hikers must stay at established camps or shelters, heard there was a $500 dollar fine if a ridge runner (forest ranger) catches you, not sure about that though, Ive seen five in the past few days. Sooooo, i was left with either go 7 miles to Mt Wilcox North Shelter or go the 21 miles to Upper Goose Pond Cabin, the decision was obvious, üôÑ. Past through some beautiful Massachusetts countryside today. Met allot of day hikers going up Cobble Hill, they all asked the 20 questions every thru hiker gets asked, lol. Passed by Main Rd which heads into Tyringham, MA and came up on a little hiker shack full of goodies. The AT Hiker Stand, I‚Äôve been seeing pictures of this for about a week on Instagram and was hoping to pass it soon. It was located on a residential property just off the road and had cold sodas and gatorade, snacks and candy, it wasn‚Äôt free, you still had to pay but it was pretty cool the family decided to put that up, there wasn‚Äôt much for stores around there so it was nice to grab a cold drink. Ended up getting into Upper Goose Pond Cabin around 7:30pm and pitched the tent. This is a two story cabin with a caretaker, has a wash room, living room and nice porch in the front. Was hoping for a bunk on the second floor but it was full, kinda figured coming in so late. Planning on sleeping in a little bit to let the legs rest tomorrow. Have about a day or so until Dalton where ill probably take a nero. Have a good night everyone.

Kept leapfrogging with a group of 5 hikers all day until most of them headed into Great Barrington, MA for resupplies. Got into a low swampy area just before the Shays Rebellion Monument (pictured) where the mosquitoes were absolutely relentless. I would try keeping a good pace and make sure ever part of my body was moving, just so they couldn‚Äôt land. I tried lighting a cigar to confuse them but that didn‚Äôt work, so i just started running, üòÇ i ran for about 1/4 mile before i got to the road and they had stopped pursuing me. I took a break at Shays Monument and waited for the three behind me, ghost got it the worst, her whole left arm was filled with bites, stupid mosquitoes. Made it to Hwy 7 about 3:30pm where most of the hikers disembarked into Great Barrington. Got a little trail magic thanks to Ron from The AT Trail Magic Van, it was cool, just a middle aged man, driving an old cargo van and opening the back door filled with sodas, snacks and fruit inside, ü§£üòÇ.

It had a nice view at the top and a nice breeze to dry all the sweat. After that it was Bear Mountain (not the one in NY) it was a nice gradual climb from Lions Head so it really didn‚Äôt feel that bad. Now coming down the north side was a different story, it had allot of very sketchy boulder hopping, most of the foot holds were on slick rock so you‚Äôre hoping your foot doesn‚Äôt slip out from under ya, üò≤.

Did the usual routine and was back on trail by 7:30am. The trail in CT has been awesome, been hiking through allot of pine forests that smell amazing. Got to CT 341 about 1:30pm and headed into Kent, CT which was 0.8 miles off trail. Had planned to get to the outfitter to grab some new socks and seam sealer but found out they had closed at the beginning of the year, that sucked. So instead i went to the Kent Welcome Center and got a shower and charged up the phone, they also had a hot dog stand with some brats. I family was out section hiking the CT portion of the AT while i was there drying out there gear, they got stuck in the heavy storms we got here a few days back. I was about to head back on trail and they graciously offered me a ride back to the trail head, that was awesome, saved me about a half hour walk back, ‚ò∫Ô∏è, the trail provides. The next portion of the trail was great, Hiked rite along the ten mile river for the next 5 miles, beautiful section of trail. Finished the day off at Silver Hill Campsite, its pretty sweet. It has a porch swing, a pavilion with picnic tables and even a deck with a view, can‚Äôt beat it. The weather has been picture perfect, a slight breeze and mid 80‚Äôs with sunshine, much better than last week, ü§£. Have a good night everyone.

When you return to civilization there is so much to do, and quickly. People you want to see and who want to see you because you've missed your home-community for several months. Adulting to catch up on, like finding work and a place to sleep every night and renewing the tags on your car because they expired while you were gone. And all of it is done while awkwardly processing and realizing the ways you've changed. It's normal to be irritable, and then to feel guilty about being irritable because you're supposed to be ""chill"" and reconnected with yourself now... Right? It's normal to drive slower than everyone else. It's normal to get ""peopled out"" way easier than you used to. It's normal to feel a little unsure and uncomfortable as you settle into things that are entirely familiar, but inside you feel different. Do your best to remember the trail everyday. And the things you said you'd do and be when you got home. Carry over your abilities to give and receive freely with the community around you. Stay active however you can and eat good foods. You got this.

They have a little hiker store and food, grabbed a few things and headed on up just a tad. Noticed that there was a food truck parked at the AT parking lot, you know i hit that up. Grabbed a few tacos and a coke, that really picked the mood up. I still had about 10 miles to go before Ten Mile Shelter so i kicked it in gear.

About 15 minutes later the storms came rolling in, heavy rain, lightning, thunder but not much for wind. The rain has been off and on for the rest of the night.

You return to a world that didn't change much while you were gone. It kept moving, but it stayed the same. And it is so far removed from the life you just left, that your hike starts to feel like a distant memory. Like maybe it never happened. You'll probably be surprised to realize how even your closest family or friends appear to have no interest in your journey at all. Instead of asking questions, looking at your pictures, or listening to your stories- they will be just as happy to talk about their own routines. And it will hurt. Because while you still care about their lives and what they've been doing, realistically their lives did not change nearly as much as yours did. And you'll be eager to share it and process it with others. People might expect you to be the same person. But you won't be. Y'all- look through your pictures often. Find low impact ways to stay active because running is probably gonna be a big NOPE from your knees and feet. Stay in touch with your other hiker friends. And expect to be very hungry for a couple weeks as you deny your hiker hunger to avoid gaining 500 pounds. But most importantly, try to have patience for the people in your life who don't ""get it.""

We were doing allot if rock climbing and boulder crawling for most of the day and in the exposed sun. By about noon i had drank almost 4 liters of water and was drenched in sweat. I looked at the weather and showed it felt like 113 degrees, so i headed into Greenwood Lake which was 0.8 miles off trail and headed to the gas station. They had a little rest area in the store, so i chilled in the A/C and hydrated. Spent a few hours cooling down and headed out to the next shelter which was 3 miles up trail. By the time I‚Äôd gotten to the shelter i was drenched again. Met up with a few hikers that had the same mindset, take an early day, drink lots if water and prepare for the rain tonight. Supposed to be a high of 80 tomorrow so that will be a relief.

Between a momma bear and her cubs to what i think is a deer groaning at us, we slept with one eye open for most if the night. It looks like were getting back into climbing gear again, had a few decent climbs of about 1000ft, think New Jersey is getting us ready for New Hampshire, ü§£. Got onto the AT Boardwalk about 2:30pm and had about a mile of flat, sun exposed hiking, it was HOT. After we got out of that we hit NJ 94 which had a roadside hit dog stand and Heaven Hill Grocery store. Got me three hot dogs and a diet coke, a nice cold refreshing diet coke in a 98 degree day is almost heaven, ü§§. I sat and chilled there for about an hour and a half and continued on. I had about 5 miles to the next shelter and plenty if day light left. But first, the Stairway To Heaven, a 1200ft climb up a boulder infested mountain, with the name and all, I thought it was going to be grueling but ended up being just a warm up, üòÇ. Got into Wawayanda Shelter about 7:30pm and made a quick dinner. Another beautiful day in New Jersey, got every type of terrain thrown at me today, made for excellent day. Have a good night everyone.

After two days of driving, we made it from Saco to Indianapolis. We spent our last night in the magic bus in the parking lot of a hotel in DuBois, PA. Something we feel really grateful for, is the feeling of doneness/closure as each phase of the journey comes to an end. When we climbed Katahdin, we felt ready. When we moved out of the van, we felt ready. And soon when we return to our sweet home city of Louisville, we will feel ready. Instead of it all feeling bittersweet, so far, it just feels sweet. Although realizing that Sunshine's car had grown mold was not sweet. And getting a $51.50 bill in the mail from a toll bridge in Jersey (which we didn't even know we crossed) was not sweet. Oh well. It be like that sometimes.

The last resupply i got from my mom back in the Delaware Water Gap, she sent packaged creme filled crepes, one chocolate and one strawberry for breakfast in the morning. WOW!

Had a few sections of rock but for the most part it was great walking trail, had got about 11 miles in by noon. Water sources were a little scarce today so had to make sure i filled up at everyone i could find.

I‚Äôve still been over packing on food when heading out of town, the first 2 days are usually pretty rough weight wise but means I don‚Äôt have to waste as much time going into towns ever 3-4 days. Headed out of the Delaware Water Gap about 10:30am and crossed over the Delaware River into New Jersey. It feels good to get PA behind me, we have been picking fights with each other for days, ü§¨. Headed into the Worthington State Forest with people everywhere, with such a beautiful day and just outside the cities it was pretty crowded. Ended up seeing two black bears and two ticks since being in Jersey, i fried the ticks with my lighter, no tick left alive, üòÇ. Passed the 1300 mile marker just before Sunfish Pond, just keep on knocking em down, üí™üòé. Today was probably one of the best hikes in a while, beautiful scenery, great people and great hiking, the first day in Jersey has been awesome.

There is a restaurant called Joe Bosco Authentic Smokehouse BBQ that we went for dinner, they best brisket I‚Äôve ever had, it just melted in your mouth, definitely check it out if your ever in the area. We got back to the hostel and it was packed. The bunkhouse holds about 11 and is full and the tent area is 1-2 tents from being full, as you can tell from the picture, some had to get a room at the hotel down the street. Set up my tent tonight so I don‚Äôt have to deal with sweating all night. The rain we got last night really dropped the humidity and actually feels somewhat cool tonight, I‚Äôm liking it.

Headed out of Delps Campsite around 8ish, there was no water at the spring last night so i waited on breakfast until i got to the shelter, pretty much B lined it there. About a mile or so before the shelter i was just doing my thing, walking and cursing at the rocks as usual. When i came to a fallen bees nest (must have fallen out of the tree) and almost stepped right on it. I said a few curse words, turned around and did the quickest 100 meter sprint over rocks I‚Äôve ever done in my life. Got far enough from it that I thought i was safe, stopped, looked back to make sure they weren‚Äôt following me and noticed one clinging to my pant leg, brushed it off and started circling me, once he realized all his other homies were gone he bolted back to his safe space, üòÇ. Cautiously walked back up trail until I noticed the nest and did a big circle avoiding that area. Got to the shelter and talked with a few hikers, sunshine got stung 3 times, joe got stung once and giggles got one, guess i got lucky or I‚Äôm just that fast, üòÅ. After that i got into Wind Gap and ventured the 0.8 mile trek to the gas station, got myself a nice refreshing ice cold 99 cent fountain coke, oooohwee did that hit the spot, think i had dreams about it last night, ü§™. Currently at Wolf Rocks Bypass, it has a good flowing spring and nice tent sites, was going to head up 3 more miles to the shelter but it was already 6pm and with the rocks another 2hrs, I‚Äôm good here. That leaves a 10 mile trek into the Delaware Water Gap and some good food.

Talk about some climbing today. Got down into the Lehigh River Gap about noon not expecting what was to come. The elevation profile looked like a steep climb of about 1000ft, but this was no run of the mill climb. For most of the sections it was straight up rock climbing, grabbing onto rock ledges, cracks in the rocks or whatever you could get ahold of. There was a blue blaze trail that went around the rock climb incase of inclement weather or the rock face is to wet, i see why know. The whole time i just had a huge grin on my face and started laughing to myself. Finally made it to the top and got a Kodak moment with an American Flag painted in the rock (pictured). You can‚Äôt see from the picture but I‚Äôm basically standing on a ledge with nothing but air in front of me, ü§£üòé. Had a nice flat trail for about 3 miles after that that ran along the ridge of Blue Mtn. I could see the town of Palmerton, PA down below, and started pointing out all the gas stations, saying ‚Äúi bet that one has ice cold cokes‚Äù‚Äùi bet this one has ice cream sandwiches‚Äù, ü§£ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Passed Little Gap Rd about 3:30pm and someone had set up a water cache, this whole section of trail has been really limited on water, so some awesome hiker left a few 10 gallon water jugs to help quench our thirst. Set up camp at Delps Campsite which had a spring 0.4 miles off trail. Went down the trail only to find the spring was dry, ü§¨. Luckily i filled up at the gap, üòÅ. Have a good night everyone.

This town is so cute and friendly. We enjoyed an awesome breakfast and coffee at a local shop. When they realized we were traveling, a barista there recommended we check out the Big Boardwalk in Orono. We decided to do it even though an ominous storm was rolling in, and I am so glad we did. The storm created a certain apocalyptic vibe and made it even more exciting. And the plant life was fascinating! Pitcher plants, irises, etc etc. @willhembree  and @stephenrhornbeck ...

Headed out if Port Clinton about 9:15am and was greeted with some familiar faces as soon as I stepped foot back on trail. Mtn Sage, Joe and Sketch had just got back on trail from taking a zero yesterday in Hamburg, PA. Glad I didn‚Äôt head that way, rooms were $150 dollars per night! Thats not on a hikers budget, thats like 2 weeks of food in trail, üôÑ. Had about a 1000ft climb out of town where we would cruise at about 1500ft for most of the day. Had a few storms come through last night and cooled it off a little and had a little breeze, which felt great. Made it up to Pulpit Rock (pictured) around 1pm, which had a great view of the PA countryside. Took a little lunch and checked out the Pulpit Rock Astronomical Park about 100ft away. It was an amateur astronomical observation center with huge telescopes. Since it was Sunday, there were allot if families and day hikers out looking at the views, very popular section of trail. Made it down to Eckville Shelter with the intention to stay the night but all the tent pads were taken. It was a nice shelter with a shower, fully enclosed shelter and nice toilet, but i pressed on to find a place to set up my tent. Made the little climb up to Dan‚Äôs Pulpit which was infested with rocks and boulders, but finally found some flat ground with no sharp pointy rocks. Legs and feet are feeling good.

That campsite last night was epic. Around 8pm a crew of 3 dudes I‚Äôve been leapfrogging with showed up at camp. I dared rambles to swing into the pond, he didn‚Äôt even hesitate, took his phone out, took his shoes off and tarsaned it right into the pond. I went next and the rest followed, water was definitely on the cold side but it felt amazing. We didn‚Äôt last long though, the mosquitoes thought it was supper time once the sun went down. The next morning, did the normal routine then got back on trail. Had a few really rocky sections but today the mud was my nemesis. We had a few storms roll through yesterday and it just sat on top of the trail, making us slip and slide everywhere, ü§£. Had about 18 miles into Port Clinton, PA and got into town about 4pm. Had a STEEP climb down into town, I couldn‚Äôt imagine going south on the AT and having to climb that with a pack, oofta. Port Clintons is a nice little trail town and is about 2 miles outside of Hamburg which has a Walmart and Wawa, gunna do a resupply there tomorrow. Planning on a zero tomorrow if everything goes right, be nice to get out if the heat for a bit. Have a good night everyone. Thanks for all the love and support.

Crossed over the Susquehanna River (pictured) and made the rock infested climb out of Duncannan. Stayed up on the ridge line for the rest of the day. It was another hot one and was stopping at every spring to fill up, most of the springs where 5 or more miles apart and was going through a liter every hour. The pace was allot slower today due to the rocks but every now and then we‚Äôd get a good section and pick the pace up. Had a few views, mainly clearings for power lines and allot of graffiti on the rocks, must be a big hangout spot cause there was trash and graffiti everywhere, üòîü§¨. Ankles and the soles of me feet are pretty banged up, these trail runner shoes are nice and lightweight but don‚Äôt offer much protection from the jagged rocks, man up SCOTT! ü§£ü§™.

For the past few hundred miles I‚Äôve been paying attention to the elevation of shelters and tent sites. Most shelters will be in a gap or low lying place cause it‚Äôs usually closer to springs and streams, but can get humid with no breeze. Usually when i find the sites that are on ridge lines or peaks there is a little bit of a breeze. <br>Had about a 6 mile section on a ridge line infested with hard, round rocks, they were everywhere! I thought I‚Äôd be getting into Duncannon, PA about 2ish but those ROCKS were stripping my soul, üòÇüò¢. But I finally made it into town about 3:45pm and was glad i was dine for the day. The original plan was to stay at the Riverfront Campground, $5 thru hiker special with showers and right next to the river, good deal right? Wrong! This place was a crap hole, it was one of those Campgrounds that allowed long term campers and RVers. I seen a 16 foot flat bed trailer with an 8 person Ozark Trail tent and picnic table right on the trailer and looked like it‚Äôd been there for years. I said screw this and spent the $25 on a hostel in town. The Doyle Hotel is where I‚Äôm at tonight, an old turn of the century hotel with no AC, but i have an oscillating fan, ü§£üò•.

Started the day out with some decent climbs and had a tight squeeze in between some huge boulder fields. After the last climb it was all downhill into the Cumberland Valley. It‚Äôs an 18 mile section of flat farmland passing through numerous towns, farms and roads. The trail went right into Boiling Springs which had a nice walk along the river and a few restaurants. Stopped into Cafe 101 for lunch and got a plate of tacos. Grabbed a few things from the gas station and headed back on trail. It was really easy walking in a very narrow trail corridor and was able to get a new PR in my total miles in a day, almost 24. Feet feel good, legs feel good and basically stopped for the day to eat dinner. Had a section that past right threw a cow pasture and all the cows were hurdled up right on the trail, (pictured) I tried walking around them about 20-30 feet away. As i got closer they bum rushed me, not scared of me at all and circled me, getting there noses all up in my personal space. I eventually used my trekking poles to keep them at a distance and started walking towards the fence. They all ended up following me, the light brown one in the picture was right up on me the whole time i was in there, kinda creepy but started laughing about it after i left the pasture, people must feed them when they roll through. Passed by a few parks with people partying and scored a beer from a group of people canoeing, winning. Ended up setting up camp at a stealth spot right off trail, decent spot with a good breeze.

Camped at a pretty sweet shelter last night, actually all the shelters since harpers ferry of been really nice, flat tent pads with picnic table and fire pit, 2 level shelters, the privies have been on another level. Made it to Penmar State Park about 10am which was right before the MD/PA state border, they usually have the concession stands open but not today, üòî. Dealt with allot of rocks and boulders in sections but then would be on a nice flat pine needle trail, walking on pine needles is like walking on carpet, could do that all day. Got into Old Forge Picnic Area about 2pm, just before the last climb of the day. Was greeted with some trail magic by a man that attempted the AT last year, he said he got about 900 miles in and the knees were done, so he comes back every year and knocks iff sections of it, super cool dude. I had a few hot dogs, some chips and an ice cold coca cola, just in time for the last climb, ü§£. Got up the last climb pretty smoothly but just drenched in sweat, temp showed 96 and no wind, üôÑ. Made sure to drink plenty of water throughout the day, if I‚Äôm still sweating I‚Äôm good. Made my way into Rocky Mtn Shelter about 6:30pm and set up camp.

Not able to be pictured because it is too intangible: feeling restless and sedentary. Missing my husband. Missing the sweat and endorphins on the trail. Missing a sense of accomplishment. Missing the woods and everything quiet and natural. Learning to accept that I thought I could walk 2,192 miles, but I can't. Feeling guilty that because of me, my husband is walking alone. This hike, for me, didn't end up being about what my body can do. It ended up being about what my spirit can do, and what our relationship can do.

Stayed at the Teahorse Hiker Hostel last night, slept pretty good but felt like i was tossing and turning all night. The host of the hostel made us waffles about 8am, which were delicious, then headed back on trail. Followed the C&O Canal Towpath for about 3 miles, was a super flat, double wide, gravel trail along the Potomac River. This was where we crossed into Maryland but didn‚Äôt see a border sign, so this AT Maryland trail map is my WVA/MA sign, ü§£ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Had about 1000ft climb coming out of Harpers Ferry which was a cake walk with fresh legs. Past by Gathland State Park (pictured) which had a few War Correspondents Monuments. Got up to White Rock Cliffs (pictured) about 2:30pm and had a little snack with a great view, had a bunch of day hikers on this section of trail, decent views. Maryland doesn‚Äôt allow any stealth camping so it‚Äôs either shelters or designated camping spots, kinda messes with how many miles i can do in a day. Got into Dahlgren Backpack Campground about 5:15pm, it‚Äôs free with pretty nice tent pads, individual fire pit and own picnic table, plus a bathroom with hot showers, ‚ò∫Ô∏èüòÅ. Weather app isn‚Äôt shower any rain for the next week but will be in the mid 90‚Äôs, with humidity it‚Äôs gunna get sweaty. Have a good night everyone.

Woke up at 7am and had a plate full of pancakes made by this sweet young Italian girl, she is hiking the AT for the summer until college starts. Got back on trail and finished out the last 1/4 of the Rollercoaster, glad that‚Äôs over, just going up and down some pretty steep and rocky grade. Met allot of trail runners on this section training for races around here, would definitely make a great training area if i lived around here, would help train for those obstacle course races, üòé. After those 6 miles it was pretty flat but still had allot if rocks and roots to contend with. Met a young Japanese hiker named ‚Äúsketch‚Äù on top of Crescent Rock which had a nice view. He was sitting up there painting a picture of it in a little book he had been carrying since springer, his whole book was of views and places he has been while hiking the AT, they were amazing paintings. Got into 4 mile tent site which is 4 miles outside Harpers Ferry and should be getting in there early tomorrow morning. I‚Äôm not sure if i want to take a zero or just stop in for a bit, we‚Äôll see tomorrow if the weather looks good, saying rain for most of the day.

A woman who shaves her head when she realizes her long hair is the only reason she feels pretty. An inherently spiritual and philosophical person. Intuitive, a feeler, an introvert, but also a social butterfly around the right people. I am eager to laugh. Easily angered by loud chewing and people who are not self-aware. I hate bugs and small talk. I'm compelled to do things I'm afraid of, but totally not an adrenaline seeker. I enjoy writing and cooking and many other forms of art and self-expression. I am not easily persuaded or convinced of anything. I lack self-discipline for goals that are imposed on me, but I'm a tidal wave when I decide there's something I want to accomplish. One of my favorite feelings in the world is generating hospitality: watching friends fill their bellies with a meal that I made and drinks that I poured, sitting on my floor, laughing and telling their stories. My favorite smells are pine needles in the dirt baked by hours of sunlight, and warm concrete after a summer rain. I love to dance, be around strong women, and smoke cigars in the winter time. I am a romantic and an optimist and the happiest wife in the world. I get quiet and withdrawn when I'm angry and I hate conflict when I'm not the one who started it. I'm an overly confident driver and I sing insults to make my road rage less ugly. At home, I'm a speech-language pathologist. Out here, I'm a human being in her natural habitat. But most importantly, I'm also really bad at basketball. .<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #appalachianthruhike #atclassof2019 #atnobo #atnobo2019 #thruhike #optoutside #hikerhunger #hikertrash #appalachiantrail2019 #hikerfeed #tramily #womenwhohike"

From Blue's perspective, Pennsylvania will be remembered as a difficult state in most regards. Mentally it was a slump. Physically it was as rocky as everyone says it is. He is so strong and proving to be quite the impressive hiker, but those rocks left his feet tender and his shoes worn down and shredded just like everyone else. Trail legs were acquired long ago. The honeymoon phase wore off long ago. Now it is solely a mental game... one I would like to say he is winning, even if it isn't always easy. We really enjoy our little van home. We keep it clean and organized, and it's become our own private oasis. Something we both look forward to every day. I am finding ways to do short hikes on my own or with Blue when I can. It helps me to cope with the grieving process a bit. I don't really enjoy spending a lot of time driving. Selfishly, it isn't what I came out here to do. So it's been a growth period for me to learn about how to help out other hikers while also keeping my own boundaries and priorities in check. No offense to any of you Yankees, but the drivers up here are absolutely vicious at times. It was a culture shock to go from the trail, where you see the best in people, to the roads, where you see the worst in people. But the forest is never far. I enjoy supporting my husband on this amazing feat. I look forward to making fun dinners, hanging out outside the van, and seeing his pictures from the day. Can you believe that he was dropped off in Georgia, and walked all the way up to New York? He amazes me.

He doesn't silence his phone at night because he wants to be available if a friend should need his help. You are lucky if he is your friend, because that means you have a friend for life. Blue is a luthier and woodworker who loves to work with his hands. To take materials and concentration and time to create something that didn't exist before. When he builds, he applies careful hands and tedious attention. It truly is his happy place. Blue has incredible integrity. He will complete any task to meet his own high standards- regardless of what that task is or who will ever (or never) notice. He doesn't cut corners. He is a sincere and gentle soul. An intuitive observer of others. An impressive problem solver. Cuddly and loud after a few fingers of bourbon. Playful, hilarious, and lighthearted like a child, but cantakerous and point-blank like an old man. He is determined to never let chivalry die. He thinks we should all spend more time barefoot. He wishes children were still required to learn cursive. He roots for underdogs. He wishes men communicated their feelings more freely. He wishes women would stop trying so hard to be pretty. He will try (or eat) just about anything with little need for persuasion. He won't hesitate to be countercultural if it aligns with his values. He enjoys stirring the pot- antagonizing friends in good humor or ruthlessly playing devil's advocate in a long debate, only to reveal that he agrees with you at the end of it. He is a man of few (but valuable) words. He is ridiculously attractive. And the best damn hugger you ever met. He is my home, my playmate, my Katahdin.

That didn‚Äôt last long though, got into the south end of the roller coaster, (a 13.5 mile section of tightly packed ascents and descents) the climbs were steep and rocky but no more than 1000ft of climbing, legs felt strong and ready to go.

We met him back on Blue Mountain in Georgia, where he also coincidentally met most of his tramily. Rhythm and his buds have hung together across several states. Theirs was the first tramily Blue and I saw form on the trail. It was always inspiring to us to see how they managed to respect each other and take care of each other with a true sense of community and togetherness, yet still hike their own hikes. Although some of his tramily members might be behind or ahead of him- or at home healing from injuries- Rhythm will never be alone. He is a fun and charismatic dude who makes friends easily. Many hikers on the AT, even some who haven't met him, have enjoyed his hilarious comments in Guthooks (which were all deleted and blocked by the way.. come on Guthooks?!) Rhythm is also a certified sommelier (basically a wine expert) and plays the upright bass. Despite his classy hobbies, Rhythm is a very down to earth and laid back guy. We are glad we got to meet him and his tramily on the trail! .<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #appalachianthruhike #atclassof2019 #atnobo #atnobo2019 #thruhike #optoutside #hikerhunger #hikertrash #appalachiantrail2019 #hikerfeed #tramily"

Was hiking up to Compton Peak, was about half way up and on my left was a cliff with a great view and on my right a boulder which the AT circled to continue up to the peak, took my picture at the cliff and continued on, got around the boulder and climbed some stairs, my attention was on my feet, head was down and was using my poles to help my legs, i get about 6 steps up and look over to my right and this black bear, maybe 4-5 years old is like 10 feet away from me, he/she didn‚Äôt give two craps i was there. I jumped and yelled ‚Äúholly shit‚Äù what i thought was pretty loudly and it didn‚Äôt even faze him/her. I walked slowly up trail and the bear turned it‚Äôs head like meh, and walked off, üò≥.

Had another hot humid day and sweated my arse off, luckily the climbs are pretty easy on this section of trail. Stopped into the Skyland Resort & Restaurant for a bite to eat about 1pm, luckily i did cause we got a hell of a rain storm that passed by, had a good downpour for about 15 minutes. Headed out and began the little climb up to The Pinnacle (pictured) and had an awesome view of the Virginia countryside. Made my way down to Thornton Gap where this dude was waiting for me, FRED, life long family friend but definitely more like family at this point. Haven‚Äôt seen him much since joining the military but was so good to sit, chat and catch up on life, thanks for taking time out of your day to come see me brotha, appreciate it, üòä. After that i quickly made the 2 mile climb up to Pass Mtn Hut, as we were talking in the parking lot we seen a set of nasty looking clouds rumbling our way, the whole way up i could here them getting closer. Got to the hut just in time for the rain, waited it out for a bit then set out to get the tent up.

Well today wasn‚Äôt one of those days, üòÇü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Woke up feeling great, which was a shocker considering how much I‚Äôve hiked the past few days. Had a guy about 15ft away from my tent and could here everything, he was talking in his sleep pretty loudly, from the buts and pieces i picked up it sounded like he was nervous about taking a test, maybe college, I don‚Äôt know but it was weird, ü§£. About 4 miles on trail i came up on a black bear, i was making a climb and was turning left up the hill, i had to have been 20ft away before he ran, he was small but not small enough for momma to be around. I stopped, looked around to see if she was around but it was just him. He ran up the hill a little ways, maybe 70ft, i could still see him clear as day. I started to walk up trail and he just watched me, didn‚Äôt seem scared, more curious of me than anything. Got into Lewis Mtn Wayside about 2pm and had my an ice cold coca cola and sandwich. The temp today was allot cooler than yesterday, i sweated my arse off yesterday, still humid today but not as steamy. It was getting late in the day so I started looking for good tent sites, of course i had no water so i had to wait till the next spring. Found an awesome site on top of Hazletop Mtn but had no water, almost said screw the water the site was so good, ü§®. Got water a few miles up trail and wouldn‚Äôt you know it, not a single tent site to be found, figures. Got to Big Meadows Campground about 6:45pm, it was either walk another 2 hours to the shelter or pay $15 for a site, my feet were done so i went with the tent site. Got a shower, laundry and an ice cold coca cola, üòé. Today was a good day. Have a great day everyone.

This one was nice, showers for $1.75 for 5 minutes, laundry room and fully stocked with ice cream. Headed out about 1pm and headed up to Blackrock Overlook, it was a huge boulder that had been worn away over time and made the entire mountain full of boulders.

Her laugh fills the room with light. Bubbles is an intelligent, independent, and hospitable southern sweetheart. Her husband (Halo) is hiking the AT and was the first member of our tramily. But Halo could not conquer such a dream if it weren't for Bubbles holding down all the responsibilities at home. She keeps many plates spinning while she also takes care of her father full-time. But somehow in the mix of her busy schedule, Bubbles finds time to plan elaborate gestures to show Halo how much she cares about his journey and how proud she is of him. She planned ahead to have cake and signs waiting for Halo and his crew at the ATC in Harper's Ferry to congratulate him on making it halfway. She puts together picture albums of his hike so he can cherish the memories long after Katahdin. She rallies friends and their Church community at home, not just to help Halo along, but also to support his tramily and provide trail magic for many other hikers along the way. Bubbles has a refreshing and lively sense of humor and is a blast to be around. Her heart is deep and wide. We have been loved so genuinely by her. And when you are loved by Bubbles, you are a lucky one indeed."

She earned her trail name on her second day-hike on the Appalachian Trail, as Sunshine noticed her admiring and petting the ferns on more than one occasion. Fern's second time on the AT was a lot more peaceful than the first. The first time she walked between the white blazes, she was in the Smokies with her husband with the intention of doing a looped day-trail. Well, as we know, the AT will take you straight to Maine if you let it. She and her husband walked 8 miles before they had the daunting realization that they would have to turn around and walk those same 8 miles back to their car. But this time, Fern did a portion of the AT on purpose and loved every second of it. She is a nurse of 30 years with a hippie heart who loves to garden and spend time with her hubby and fur babies. She loves glitter and the color blue. She thinks trees are sexy when they sway in the wind. When we thanked her for being willing to drive 900 miles to visit us, she said: ""well, I didn't drive as many miles as you walked!"" Fern is kind, a lover of all things lovely, and a person who welcomes new experiences in a fashion that will keep her forever young."

He is a tough dude (note the recently broken arm and stoic expression) but also a true softy (note the ""happy birthday"" crown he tried to wear in honor of Sunshine, but ended up wearing it as a choker instead because it wouldn't stay on). Iron Man is 25 years married with one kid, and has a very supportive mother we all call ""Iron Mom."" Iron Man got his trail name because of his long career in an iron foundry. But he is a man of steel. He was diagnosed with a progressive disease called Ankylosing Spondylitis. This disease causes his joints to progressively fuse together until they are no longer mobile. He had a hard time accepting this diagnosis. But eventually he decided that it ultimately meant the best time for the AT is NOW. He was inspired to do the AT when he was doing a shakedown hike in Pennsylvania and saw a female thru hiker with one arm climbing out of Lehigh gap (a 1000ft hand-over-hand rock climb) as if it was nothing. He thought: ""if she can do it, I can do it."" As he walks between the blazes, his fusing joints are cracking back open again, and again, and again. Thru-hiking is painful, but Iron Man's baseline of daily pain is much higher than ours. He has our respect because he can break his arm in two places and then still go out to enjoy a pasta dinner and ice cream on the same day. He has our respect because he can fend off an aggressive bear in the Shenandoahs. But most importantly, he has our respect because he is a kind and giving soul who takes care of the people around him."

The town of waynesboro is very hiker friendly with an Appalachian thru hikers pavilion right in town, you can set up your tent in the park for free (three day max), have a solar charging station (doesn‚Äôt work) and can head over to the YMCA for a free shower (towel and soap provided), it‚Äôs a pretty nice set up. Went over to the local laundromat and did laundry in the sketchy part of town, üòÇ they never have them on the good side, lol. After i got all my chores done, finally went over to the Ming Garden Buffet and stuffed my face, $12 dolla all you can eat, it was AMAZING. It feels like my body doesn‚Äôt know what to do with all this food and just shuts down, it was a long walk back to camp, ü§£ü§¢. I swear I don‚Äôt plan this, but looks like this weekend is Waynesboro‚Äôs trail days fest and are having soapbox car races tomorrow, totally checking that out, don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever witnessed one of those.

At this point the tent is wet, shoes have been soaked and sleeping bag is pretty damp, doing all i can to keep everything dry, but 4 days of this it‚Äôs been pretty tough. Started the day out with a 2400ft climb up to Big Rocky Row, if the rain didn‚Äôt have me drenched the sweat sure did, that was a tough climb. Had a few other little climbs going up Bluff Mtn, Punchbowl Mtn and Rice Mtn. Shortly after that i hit the big ole 800 mile marker, seems like it took forever with these last few days. With the wet socks, shoes and clothes, been getting some nasty chafing, especially on the feet and groin.

Got up and quickly tore down the wet tent and continued on. Luckily since i did all that climbing yesterday, mist of today was downhill. It rained for most of the morning until about noon, the wind gusts had died down also so it wasn‚Äôt blowing all the water off the trees. Made it up to Highcock Knob which was the biggest climb for the day, about 800ft. Got into Matts Creek Shelter and had a snack, the trail follows Matts Creek for a bit after that until we cross over the James River. This is the longest foot use only bridge along the AT, not sure how long it was, had allot of day hikers checking it out. Tried to get a ride into town but everyone was going the other way and had no cell signal to call for one, so i just headed back on trail and hit up the next shelter.

Injuries happen and you can't schedule recovery any better than you can schedule the injury itself. The van is our home and we enjoy it! We recently got drawers to organize our food better and spent a good half day arranging everything to be as clean and efficient as possible. Bluegrass has encountered some rocks and rock mazes on the trail, but for the most part it hasn't been too bad yet. Lots of flat and beautiful farm land and some boardwalks. He's been a hiking machine through every obstacle. And we are near many hikers we know and love. While he may not get to camp with them every night, seeing them on the trail and in towns has been awesome. Halo is close to catching us after leaving trail for a wedding, and many others such as Q, RG, Stingray, Iron Man, Rhythm, Nibbles and Radar, Spruce Lee and Shiitake, Mighty Mouse and Which Way, Roo, (the list goes on...) they are never far! Sunshine does trail magic every single day, whatever she can manage. Sometimes that involves a shuttle or picking up a package, or handing out sodas and snacks, or writing inspirational phrases with pebbles, or cleaning a hostel from head to toe. No matter what it is, we find that the more you give the more you get. That isn't why we are doing it, but it's an amazing law of nature to find yourself in the middle of. We've been honored guests in people's homes enjoying wine and games and birthday cakes, stumbled upon secret bars in small towns with $1.50 beers... it's been a blast. What it comes down to is that we love living our lives with each other, whatever that looks like. Making decisions together is easy and we are a strong team. We are so grateful to all the hikers and angels we know who genuinely support our journey even though it isn't as ""purist"" as we originally intended. You all have been so kind and uplifting, and it means the world."

We used to worry about heavy packs, the weather, water, etc. Insead, now we are feeling lonely, alienated, and conflicted with our identities as hikers. Sunshine feels less included now that she is off trail and traded her stinky pack for a set of keys. People don't immediately look at her and know she is a hiker, which is unexpectedly  hard. Now her ""hike"" has a strange caviat... An explanation that has to be given many times a day when people see the van. And its a very sad conversation to have over and over again- explaining why she isn't walking. She passes up trail magic and doesn't feel welcome to it anymore. She notices her leg muscles getting softer and weight coming back. She tried to do squats but her knees weren't having it, and her feet are still in too much pain to do any substantial day-hiking. So she's trying to limit calories with a hiker hunger that hasn't subsided yet. She is hangry and forced to be sedentary, and feeling very frustrated in her own body... Missing the woods terribly. Blue might see people he knows on the trail, but he isn't ending his day with them at the same camps or shelters. And that is where most of the visiting and social aspects of the trail take place. Instead he is hiking to parking lots and gaps. He struggles with feeling like he isn't a thru-hiker because of the amenities of the van and slackpacking every day. He even put his AT tag on his slack pack so he might avoid some of the awkward/explaining conversations Sunshine also deals with. We miss walking together. We miss the straightforwardness of our journey before the van. And Blue sometimes wonders what the point is of doing this if he doesn't get to be with Sunshine and other hikers. We are trying to make the most of this, but it isn't as carefree as it looks. Mentally, this is so much harder. And I don't know how to share pictures of mental struggles so here are some pretty flowers."

Finally about 11am it looked like the rain had cleared out, took the shuttle to the trail head and was once again on my way. I think I‚Äôm going to call today ‚Äúremember where you started‚Äù, it literally felt like i was back in Georgia with all this climbing. Started out at 951ft of elevation and by the end of the day had hit 4227ft, but with all the ascents and descents getting to that point could probably double the total ascent climbed for today. I started getting a tight muscle on my left shin about halfway through the day, would have to stop and massage it every once and a while to help it, feels like it wants to lock up, but by the end of the day it was better, still there, but better. Made it to the top of Apple Orchard Mtn finally and went through the guillotine (pictured), looked like a fallen rock wedged between two huge boulders, kinda creepy. Not too many people on trail today, guess allot waited out the rain. Seen about 6 people slack packing southbound and inly ran into one other northbound, made for a lonely day. The wind gusts were pretty high today, blowing the water off the trees and blowing the big trees around, making for allot of creaking and moaning, I‚Äôd swear I‚Äôd hear people talking but knew I hadn‚Äôt seen anyone in an hour, the trees are talking to me, ü§£üòÇ.

Had coffee and breakfast and waited for it to clear out, finally did by about 10am. Most of the trail was pretty slick, most of the tread on my shoes has been worn away, i guess walking 700 miles will do that, lol. Most of the views were whited out, but it was a pretty calm day on trail. Got into Middle Creek Campground around 4:30pm and threw the wet clothes in the dryer. Still have 4 more days of this wet crap, so nothings going to dry easily, or at all. Have a pretty nice scenic section coming up tomorrow so hopefully it isn‚Äôt all whited out, but probably will be.

The hotspot on my left foot is pretty much gone, been putting tape on it every morning to prevent any further agitation which seemed to work. Made a few road crossings and a rail crossing before heading up to the Blue Ridge Parkway. The trail has been cruising right along with it all day, making some great trail and views. Noticed that this section of the AT is pretty well maintained, all the over growth has been cut recently. Had a few sections that were out of the tree canopy and what a difference the temp was, it was hot, i checked the weather and it said it felt like 92, summer here we come.

I met a man there who really left an impression on me. He treated his girlfriend with such chivalry and care, and I had never actually seen that kind of demeanor in a guy my age before. And now, that man comes home to me and this van every night- my husband. This van saw me through many roadtrips. Saw acquaintences turn into sisterhoods. My first ever genuine prayers happened in this van. Today I've been thinking about how things have a tendency to come full circle, and how our lives end up being so much more than we ever could have expected or predicted. I'm so glad I drove the magic bus to Louisville eleven years ago with a chick I barely knew. I'm so glad my dad drove the van to Blue and I on this hike so our adventure didn't have to end entirely. I'm so glad I set a trend early on in my life of ""stepping out on limbs"" and ""putting myself out there""... Because so many adventures, lessons, and relationships came from it. And I'm so grateful to be here now, immersed in the best community in the world, experiencing amazing new things every day, with the greatest man in the world next to me<br>. .<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #appalachianthruhike #atclassof2019 #atnobo #atnobo2019 #thruhike #optoutside #hikerhunger #hikertrash #appalachiantrail2019 #hikerfeed"

Got a little later start this morning which was needed after the 23 mile day yesterday. Legs and feet were pretty tight and didn‚Äôt want to move, but after walking around and some Kung Fu Fighting they were ready to go. Had a nice little climb up Cove Mtn and to the Dragons Tooth which was a huge stone monolith. For these first 7 miles it was rock climbing, climbing up sheer granite with a few metal ladders hammered right into the rock, some of it was pretty sketch, but fun. Got into Catawba Grocery store around 1ish and ate all the carbs my stomach would allow, and a few diet cokes. Sat there and charged some batteries while i ate. After that i headed back on trail and was treated to a great section of trail with view and view, the Virginia countryside has been epic. This section of trail is also very popular with allot of day hikers out, even on a Monday. Started the 1200ft climb up to McAfee Knob about 4:30pm, felt like i was running into people about every minute or so, i could smell their perfume or cologne from a mile away and they could probably say the same for me but just straight up stank ü§£. Got up to McAfee Knob about 6:30pm and was the only one up there besides a thru hiking couple from Europe. McAfee Knob is the most photographed section of the entire AT, and know i see why, the view here was humbling. I‚Äôve seen many pictures and video of this overlook but man, they just do not do it justice, this place has to be experienced first hand. I st up there for a half hour and continued on to Pig Farm Campsite just before Cambell Shelter, no it‚Äôs not on a pig farm, lol. Temps are supposed to fall into the upper 40s tonight, thats some gooood sleeping weather. Have a good night all.

It was nice starting the day out with a downhill for a change. Past through some nice virginia farmland, the rolling hills out here are beautiful. Past by the Keffer Oak tree, over 18ft around and over 300 years old, the Dover Oak tree along the AT in NY is slightly bigger. Didn‚Äôt have much for elevation gain again today, but these rocks and boulders are the plague of my existence. Most of the day was walking on huge slates of rock and almost a 45 degree angle hoping not to slip and fall on my butt. Got into Craig Creek Rd about 2:30pm after about 14 miles and was greeted with some trail magic, i walked up on the guy and he yells ‚Äúnow there‚Äôs a guy in need of a double cheeseburger!‚Äù, so i sat and ate a double cheeseburger and a sprite, oooh wee was that good, and just in time for the last climb of the day. About a 1500ft climb up to the Audie Murphy Monument, he was the most decorated American soldier of WWII, even had an American Flag pole up there. Made my way back down the backside of Brush Mtn, the feet and legs were about done by this time but not as bad as I‚Äôd thought they‚Äôd be when i planned on doing this many miles. Got into Pickle Branch Shelter about 7:30pm, well set my tent up just before it anyway. I got about 7 miles to Catawba Grocery in the morning, was running out of food hence the high miles today.

Made a double batch of my special blend coffee and some pop tarts. Once that initial shock of putting cold wet clothes on is over, and your body temp warms them up it does suck a little less üòÇ. Got back on trail around 8:30am and finished the climb I‚Äôd started yesterday before the rain. Pretty easy miles today in terms of elevation but the dang ole rocks and boulders had my pace down to a screeching halt. Nothing had time to dry from last night and had the rocks uber slippery, plus the tread on my shoes is dang near gone, mix that with wet rocks and it made for an adventure. About 10am the sun finally came out and started drying everything out. Passed by the road to Mountain Lake Resort, or more commonly known as ‚Äúthe Dirty Dancing Resort‚Äù where the original film was shot. I really wanted to go check it out but it was 5 miles down the road and didn‚Äôt have a ride üò©. Stopped into War Spur Shelter for lunch and laid some gear out to dry, didn‚Äôt really do much since it has been so humid. Started the first real climb of the day going up to Kelly Knob, about a 2000ft climb. Started to get a hot spot on the side of my left foot from walking in the wet socks all day, stopped and put some tape over it just to get me 4 more miles to the next shelter. Stopped at Kelly Knob Overlook, but was overgrown and not much of a view. Got into Laurel Creek Shelter around 4:30pm and layer most my gear out in the sun, hopefully get these socks dry. This is a pretty nice shelter, has water, a privy and decent tent pads. Fingers crossed it doesn‚Äôt rain again tonight ü§û.

Had a good nights rest at Woods Hole Hostel but was up and on trail in no time. Neville, the caretaker of the fine establishment made no bake chocolate oatmeal bars that were amazing, i had two for breakfast before i left, they had to weigh at least a pound each. Had about a 12 mile hike into Pearisburg, VA and got into town around 1:30pm. Had a few good views of the country side, views have been rare around here and usually have to take a blue blaze to go see them, usually worth it. Once in town, made a stop at DQ for a flamethrower burger and fries, so unhealthy but oh so good. Ran over to the Post Office and sent a few of my cold weather gear home that was taking up space and adding unneeded weight. Pack is a little lighter but not quite where I‚Äôd like it to be. Walked around Pearisburg for a bit to checkout the town but really wasn‚Äôt much to see. Headed back the DQ, this time for a Turtle Pecan Blizzard, could have eaten 5 of those but didn‚Äôt want to get fat, lol. I got a hitch back to the trail but the guy dropped me off at the wrong trailhead. There were 2 about 0.6 miles apart and he dropped me off at the further one. So being the AT Purest (someone who walks ever inch of the trail) i am, i walked back to where i had left off then turned around and walked back in the right direction. Just like with any town, the trail went up about 2000ft to the ridge line. Setup camp at Rice Field Shelter and realized this shelter doesn‚Äôt have water source, bruh! So i made the 0.6 mile trek back down the trail to the last piped spring and CLIMBED back up. The meals i eat for dinner are dehydrated so water is a must have, otherwise i would have just waited till morning. Actually have service tonight for once, gunna Netflix and chill.

Got back on trail around 8am and was ready for a short day, feet, ankles and buttocks were ready for a break. Hiked about 6 miles to Trents Grocery were i had a resupply package from my amazing grandma & grandpa waiting for me. Have mentioned how HOT it‚Äôs been the past week? If not, it‚Äôs been crazy hot, just walking at an easy pace has me sweating bullets. Got into Trents about 11:30am and finally got to take a shower, do laundry and dry everything out, not bad for 6 bucks. Were camped right next to a stable with a horse named Thomas and he loooooves apples. He‚Äôs a little older and can barely see but he‚Äôs a gooood boy.

I thought I would walk here. But I drove. I tearfully asked a trail angel on the phone before my drive if the ATC would still take my picture.  He responded emphatically, after saying ""YES"" a dozen times: ""you should be proud of what you've done. You were injured and had to rest, but you are hiking this trail. Get your picture taken!"" I said okay, dried my tears and started my drive. When I got there I walked around and visited with other hikers while I waited for Blue. I talked with ""dot com,"" a volunteer there at the ATC, who was so encouraging about our journey. She said, ""when other people finish the AT, they are done and don't know what to do. You can still have a little part of it left waiting for you."" She reminded me that doing trail magic during this time is a great way to experience the trail without walking on it. Then I saw these posters of other hikers whose journeys were unexpected and unconventional... And I felt encouraged. Blue finally arrived, and we took our halfway picture together. The last 12 days have been so mentally difficult. I didn't walk past the 1000th mile or the West Virginia sign. And no, I didn't walk into Harper's Ferry. But we journeyed here together. And now, we will walk out together.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #appalachianthruhike #atclassof2019 #atnobo #atnobo2019 #thruhike #optoutside #hikerhunger #hikertrash #appalachiantrail2019 #hikerfeed #harpersferry"

We hung out there for about an hour with a few other thru hikers then decided to git the trail. We crossed over US Hwy 52 down to Kimberling Creek and started another 500ft steep climb back up to the ridge line. These ridge lines are nice when you get up them but the lack of water sources suck, we went about 8 miles with not one water source üò©. Passed the 600 mile marker about 4 miles before the shelter, 600 miles knocked down, 1,590 to go üò≥. Currently at Jenny Knob Shelter which had the closest water source.

The trail was kind of uneventful today, not much going on, just pounding the miles down. Met a few new thru hikers at Jenkins Shelter, met one girl that started the AT in February but took a few weeks off for work and is heading up to maine for the long haul. Had a nice little climb just after lunch, then followed an old service road that was nice and flat, made for a nice easy day which was nice cause it was HOT. The green tunnel is a life saver when the sun is at maximum power, spent a few miles hiking in the sun and what a game changer it is when you finally get back in the shade, felt like a 15-20 degree difference. Set up camp next to Laurel Creek and went for a little swim in the deep spot, let the feet soak for a bit and washed all the sweat off, it felt gooood üòã.

Started the day out with some nice downhill to The Settlers Museum, there was an old school house from the late 1800‚Äôs that had some trail magic, ice cold sodas and snacks, place was kinda creepy. The trail crossed Hwy 81 in Atkins, VA which had a few gas stations and a restaurant called The Barn.

We hit mile marker 457 which is the 1/4 way mark for NOBOs, that is a HUGE milestone for me, sat there for a moment to let it all sink in and reflect on the past 547 mile walk, it feels good...real good. After that we had some VERY steep climbs, the guide book did not do any of them justice. We had about 6 little bumps, no more than 4-5 hundred feet but man did they kick my butt. It has been really hot the past few days and with the hills i was pretty much drenched. After the last climb of the day we had a little downhill (ü•≥) into camp. For taking a 3 hour lunch and getting 14 miles in, i think we did pretty good. Hopefully sleep better tonight and not wake up every 20 minutes.

The package didn‚Äôt end up showing until 2pm and there was a hiker picnic in troutdale at 6pm. We debated on whether to stay for the picnic or head out and get some miles in, with all the hikers heading to the picnic we decided to stay. It was a good time, there was so much food and some killer desserts. I think they said their were about 60 hikers, which was down some from last year.

Out-given. I've received trail magic and I've given it, but it doesn't matter. Yesterday I handed a hiker a bag of popcorn because it was her favorite snack and she had just eaten her last bag. We talked for a bit and she asked enough questions that I ended up telling her about my plantar fasciitis and why we have the van. She asked my name and I told her ""I'm Sunshine."" Her reaction was so squeal, pull me in for a hug, kiss my sweaty cheek, and say ""you ARE Sunshine!"" Before our interaction was over she held hands with me as she prayed for my feet and gave me a $20 bill so I could do more magic for other hikers. After she left I sat in the van and asked myself, ""what the heck just happened? Who gave magic to who?"" The cool thing I'm learning as a hiker pretending to be a trail angel for a bit, is how to receive. As a person giving, I love it when the hikers stick around for a bit and tell me how their day is going and other stories from their hike so far. I want them to take one of everything and say ""yes"" to every favor I offer. So, when my feet allow me to walk the trail again, that is how I will receive trail magic: eagerly, abundantly, and in no hurry. I will not be sheepish and thank them too many times because I feel that I am inconveniencing them, because I'll know that I am not. I now know how it is just as much a joy to give as it is to get. My best way to say ""thank you"" is just to receive joyfully... Especially since I can't afford a $20 bag of popcorn.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #appalachianthruhike #atclassof2019 #atnobo #atnobo2019 #thruhike #optoutside #hikerhunger #hikertrash #appalachiantrail2019 #hikerfeed #trailangel #trailmagic"

She would do anything for her kids, her kids' spouses, and even her kids' friends if they needed her. TM has seen first-hand how magical the AT community can be, and she fell in love with it just as much as we did. She even established  long-distance friendships with some of our tramily, their spouses, and trail angels we know out here. One of our favorite moments of our hike so far was coming down on the switchbacks into Erwin and seeing her silhouette through the trees, leaned up against the guardrail waiting for us. We had no idea she was coming and we tearfully ran down with our full packs to get one or three of her famous hugs. TM is sassy, independent, observant of others, and willing to try just about anything once. We feel supported by her every day because we know she believes in us.

We think his trail name should be ""screw-loose."" When you mix determination, a giving heart, and out-of-the-box thinking, you get something like him. He's the kinda guy who drives 8+ hours from Indianapolis to BFE Virginia to let his daughter and son-in-love use his van. And better yet, it was his idea. He wouldn't hike the AT in a million years. In fact, he says there isn't anything in the world he would want to do everyday, all day, for 6 months straight. He has a point. But even though he doesn't want to be in our stinky muddy shoes, he shows genuine interest and support toward what we are doing. Screw-loose loves a good story, and he enjoys helping others write theirs. The elements of a good story are hardship, victory, and compelling characters. Screw-loose is a compelling character who will rally alongside you in your hardship until you have your victory moment. He is goofy, heavily caffeinated, a talker, a thinker, a doer, and a man who could care less about the ""normal"" way to do things. Perhaps that's why his daughter was crazy enough to think that walking 2,192 miles was a good idea. Yeah, we will go ahead and blame that one on him. .<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #appalachianthruhike #atclassof2019 #atnobo #atnobo2019 #thruhike #optoutside #hikerhunger #hikertrash #appalachiantrail2019 #hikerfeed"

But it wouldn't be like us if we didn't share the unlovely parts too. Like how strange it felt to drive again for the first time in 3 months. And to not be together 24/7. Especially the first day Blue hiked without me, it felt very foreign for both of us. I shed a few tears as I watched him walk away on the AT alone. He felt lonely without me there, especially since our entire tramily has dispersed between trail days, getting off trail, or being behind or ahead of us. I worried about him a lot and checked his GPS often. Struggled with all the downtime and seeing so many cars and roads and signs instead of trees and birds and streams. I also still have the hunger of a hiker, but not the activity level of one. So I've spent a lot of time being hungry, with very little to do, and with many yummy hiker foods within arms reach. Torture! I've had a lot of time to think ""what if my feet don't heal"" and worrying about losing my trail legs entirely. And there's been a slight identity crisis... Feeling like I can't really call myself a thru-hiker right now, and not feeling like I belong in hostels or campgrounds because I didn't walk there. It has occurred to me that this is only a fraction of what we will both feel when we return home. Back to the daily grind, feeling relatively sedentary, not being able to satisfy our appetites for mountains and honey buns, not spending every night in the woods, and encountering people all the time who won't know us as hikers or match our interest in the AT. (Sidenote- if you have a friend at home who's spent time on the AT or any other long trail, show them some love by asking about their experiences. Maybe call them by their trail name every now and then. It will mean more than you know.) Anyway- None of these things have overpowered the ""good"" that we see in this situation. But they are still parts of the experience, and therefore worth sharing!<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #appalachianthruhike #atclassof2019 #atnobo #atnobo2019 #thruhike #optoutside #hikerhunger #hikertrash #appalachiantrail2019 #hikerfeed"

We are having a total blast. It was a hard decision for us to make to get the van and rest Sunshine's feet for an extended period of time. But it was clearly our best option. Once the decision was made, we jumped into it wholeheartedly and put our efforts into enjoying this phase of our hike as much as possible. That means driving to sunset vistas because we can, tons of trail magic, slackpacking bigger miles than ever, comfy car sleeps, and eating food we usually wouldn't because they are too heavy to carry. Bluegrass realized that the mentality behind his hikes needs to adapt when he slackpacks alone. Since his solo slackpacking can't be about quality time with Sunshine, he decided to change his focus to turning it into a fun challenge. He's been having a great time seeing how fast and far he can go, and looking forward to seeing Sunshine and the Magic Bus in mountain gaps and parking lots along the way. At the end of the day, he is feeling good mentally and emotionally and feeling pretty proud of what he accomplished. Sunshine has had fun leaving notes/signs for him along the trail and reading maps to determine where she will see him next. Even though we aren't hiking together, we saw our first bear together from the van while driving to the trail head! We were pumped about that. We adjusted to vanlife pretty quickly and have a system that works really well already. We are so pumped we get to experience thru-hiking, vandwelling, and trail angel-ing all in one adventure!<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #appalachianthruhike #atclassof2019 #atnobo #atnobo2019 #thruhike #optoutside #hikerhunger #hikertrash #appalachiantrail2019 #hikerfeed"

I jumped right up to run out and grab em but it was too late, they were soaked when i woke up, oh well. Got back on trail about 8am and headed up the Virginia Creeper/AT for about a mile, then the AT split from the Creeper. We missed the sign where the two split and ended up going 0.6 miles up the Creeper before we realized we hadn‚Äôt seen a whiteblaze in a while. Made it to a cow pasture about 11:30am and seen a bunch if baby cows, seven started talking to them but they paid no attention. We got some more trail magic just before our big climb of the day. We walked up and he handed us some ice cream sandwiches and a can of pop. We found out he was a retired Army Ranger and has been going up and down the AT helping hikers out, he was a cool dude. After that we had a 2000ft climb up to Whitetop Mtn, it wouldn‚Äôt have been so bad but the rocks and boulders on the trail really slowed us down, took about 1.5 hours to get up, but it was worth it. We had a beautiful 360 degree view of our surroundings, had lunch and laid our gear out to dry. Eventually made our way down to Elk Garden which was a beautiful open prairie, we were going set up camp there but it was to early. Had an 1100ft climb up Mt Rogers to get to Thomas Knob Shelter. The whole way up again was nothing but rocks, ideal foot placement was a must, one miss step and you could easily roll an ankle. Finally made it to camp about 5:30pm, set up camp, made dinner and laid my tired butt down.

Most hikers out here are very polite. Some don't know any better. And the minority are just plain rude. Regardless, spreading some awareness is up to us, so here goes!<br>1. Hikers going uphill have right-of-way. Move over for them to pass so they don't lose their momentum, unless they say that they are eager for a reason to take a break.<br>2. Always move over for groups.<br>3. Don't take up more space than you need at shelters or picnic tables<br>4. If a hiker has caught up to you, that means their pace is faster than yours. Don't get competitive, just move over and wish them a good hike.<br>5. When the sun goes down, so should your noise level. The darker it is, the quieter you should be.<br>6. Use an earbud to listen to music instead of playing it for all to hear. We would like to choose when we listen to music and what we listen to... Don't make that choice for others.<br>7. Try to avoid setting up in a shelter after dark and/or when hikers are clearly sleeping. Obviously bad weather is an exception.<br>8. Don't move other people's gear.<br>9. If you leave a shelter before sunrise, please try to pack up as quietly as possible.<br><br>We don't mean to sound preachy! And most of this should be common sense.

Good by Tennessee! You have been wet, cold, hot and got to watch spring wrap around your beautiful landscape, but Virginia is calling my name and i must go. Had another 3 miles to go before we got into Damascus. This weekend is Trail Days and is the biggest event of the year along the AT, hikers from every part of the trail take a break from walking and come to enjoy the festivities. We got into town around noon and went to tent city to set up camp. The town opened up the ball fields for hikers to camp for the weekend, free showers, free laundry and free haircuts, i almost feel civilized! ü§£ The Damascus Fire Department had a free hiker feed for all hikers, deep fried chicken, potatoes, coleslaw and brownies, so good.

This year is his third attempt at thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail. We were excited to be there as he crossed the Punchbowl Overlook- the furthest he'd ever walked on the AT in his previous attempts, until this year when he finally walked past it. Teach is kind, witty, resilient, competitive, and candid. Teach is many things. A joker, a woodworker, a kickboxer, a martial artist, an enthusiast, an ADD poster child, an adrenaline seeker, a hiker... But most importantly, he is an incredible father and teacher. He has a rare and wonderful ability to connect with, understand, affirm, and empower others. He gets to the heart of things and does them his way- not the conventional/textbook way. He took the role of ""dad"" on as his greatest honor and enjoyed every second of it. He speaks of his daughter in such a way that it is clear she is the light of his life. As an educator, he connected with the most troubled kids in personal and effective ways, and created a safe place in his classroom that many students flocked to.  A free spirit with the kind of wisdom that only comes from time and maybe a few mistakes. But don't call him mature or you might hurt his feelings. .<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #appalachianthruhike #atclassof2019 #atnobo #atnobo2019 #thruhike #optoutside #hikerhunger #hikertrash #appalachiantrail2019 #hikerfeed"

Made it to US 91 by about 2pm and had a little less than 3 miles to the next shelter. When we passed the road, we seen a sign for the Rabbit Hole hostel which had $4 chocolate milkshakes, we were sold. Got a shuttle there and set our tents up and took a shower.

Started the day with a great hike to Laurel Falls (pictured) and passed by some awesome camp sites along the way. Got to our first major climb of the day, about 2000ft of elevation gain in less than 2 miles. It was pretty steep in sections but for the most part was switchback after switchback followed by false summit after false summit. After those zero days the legs just didn‚Äôt want to get going. What goes up, must go down, we didn‚Äôt even get a nice view at the summit, just a ‚Äúhey your at the top, now go back down‚Äù. üòí once we hit the bottom, we passed by Shook Branch Recreation Area and stopped to take a lunch. We set our packs down and chilled at the picnic area.

Passed by Wilbur Dam Rd and braced for our last climb of the day. My feet were in pretty rough shape by this time, but they had been hurting for most of the day, gotta get em back in hiker shape. ü§£ all of us were wining and moaning going up that hill, and were looking for camp spots to stop at, it always seems like when you‚Äôre looking for a spot they‚Äôre just never around, but could pass 20 of them on the way there. üòí We passed by 2 full campsites and finally found a little clearing big enough for three tents (433.5).

Just wanted to provide a status update for today and tomorrow. going to take two more zero days here in Hampton for two reasons.<br><br>Reason 1- The weather has been pretty crappy all day today. This morning I had packed up all my gear and headed to the trail head with the intention to hike on. I had gotten to the trail head and meet up with a few other hikers and showed me the weather forecast. The next 2 days have scattered thunderstorms all day. not too big of a deal but the next reason pretty much solidified our decision.<br><br>Reason 2- I'm not getting into to much detail about it, you can google it if you want. Don't want to spread the rumor mill more than it already is. Yesterday there was an individual on the trail (not a thru hiker) who had gotten into a confrontation with 2 other thru hikers just north of Damascus, VA. It escalated and the police got involved, the individual is currently in custody. For the safety of thru hikers, that 20 mile section of trail is closed until further notice. That section of trail is about 3-4 days north of us. So we are deciding to sit and chill until the trail reopens. It sucks that one individual can cause such a ruckus on what in my experience has been a super safe trail. All the thru hikers have banded together to help support those involved and those in the vicinity. <br>Thanks everyone for the Support and please don't think that this trail is anything but safe. A few bad apples shouldn't tarnish what makes this trail great, the people! Thanks for all the love and support.

This is the montage of our last few days. The town of Glasgow has been kind to us. It seems to mark a turning point in our hike, where our perspective made a big shift from ""having a duty"" to ""enjoying a journey."" And goodness do we feel a weight off of our shoulders because of it. We wouldn't be surprised if this new outlook, though it might seem counterintuitive, leads to bigger miles and happier hikes. Our goal is to enjoy the hell out of these 6 months. Sunshine has been working out dozens of knots in each foot and resting them like it's her job. Bluegrass is kind and supportive and playful as ever... Having fun shooting Sunshine with his watergun when she is too crippled to run away. That's okay. She will just keep shooting him from the safe zone (her quilt) where he isn't allowed to retaliate. 800 miles is around the corner.

No take, only throw. He is an adept hiker with the advantages of an extra pair of legs, a low center of gravity, and absolute positivity and eagerness. He leaps over logs like a deer when he gets the zoomies. He will eat your beef sticks if you offer them. He throws a minor tantrum when Dad puts his pack on in the morning, but it's clear that he loves to hike and is pretty darn good at it. Jasper has tons of energy, even after a long day.

He uses a wood burning stove to cook his meals, so the rain has an interesting impact on his diet. He is the opposite of ultralight. He has taken 5 showers so far, but 4 of them were in one day. He is a resilient hiker who can put up with a fair amount of suck with a smile on his face. He hiked 54 miles in 24 hours just for funsies, then partied hard that night.

Stayed at Mountain Harbour B&B/hostel last night cause of all the good reviews for their breakfast. Oooh weee!! It was simply amazing! Homemade biscuits and gravy, scrambled eggs with cheese, bacon, ham, strawberries, berry danish and cupcakes. Hands down best breakfast I‚Äôve had in over a month. After that deliciousness i got back in trail about 9am. Of course being in a gap the only way out is up, not much of a climb though, maybe 1000ft. At the top was a nice open ridge with views of the surrounding area, some nice lush grass land. Past Isaacs Cemetery, would have been real creepy at night. There were lots of day hikers out heading to Jones Falls. Cool water fall right off trail. Probably 50 to 60 feet high with water running off the shale rock, which is abundant around here. After i hit the 400 miles marker, still can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve walked 400 miles, only 1,790 miles to go. üòé took a quick lunch at Elk River. The trail runs beside it for a half mile and it‚Äôs pretty clear, allot if people swimming in it. I went up to test it with my big toe, nope, to damn cold! ü•∂ after that it was pretty much just bleh for the rest of the day. Felt like i was in the green tunnel, walking through rhododendron forests. Camp is set up, have few neighbors tonight, some young college kids, they better not be up all night blaring their Post Malone crap! ü§£üòâ plan for tomorrow is to get up early and head into Hampton, TN.

So that amazing few I showed everyone yesterday with the amazing sunrise. Yea, that didn‚Äôt happen. The clouds rolled in about 1am and brought the wind with it. Woke up every 15 minutes to the wind pile driving my tent. It finally cooled off a little around 6am but still had some strong gusts. Had breakfast and coffee and quickly tried to take down the tent, it was a chore with the wind. The first hour of hiking was a white out, sucks cause there were some good views, just couldn‚Äôt see em. Made it to Little Hump Mountain (388.1), about 6 miles in and things began to clear up. Being in the Roan Highlands, which is a series of five mountains with balds on top, makes the views go on forever. Made the climb up to Hump Mountain (391.8) and enjoyed the view with a little lunch (pictured earlier). Best place EVER to take a lunch. From here it was all down hill, passing the Doll Flats which is the TN/NC border. That means today was the last time I‚Äôll step foot in NC while on the AT. Two states down, twelve to go! Wooo!! Continued down the rock infested trail for another 2 miles and reached US 19E. I‚Äôve been hearing about the amazing breakfast at Mountain Harbor Hostel. Debated heading that way, but it was only 0.3 miles off trail, why not! Got a tent site for $10 and a shower. Bought 2 burgers with fries from the food truck here, yes, they have a food trucküòÇüòç. This place is pretty cool, they turned an old barn into a B&B/hostel. Plan is to eat some amazing breakfast in the morning and get back on trail. Next few days should be good as far as elevation goes. Have a good night.

Woke up about 7am and started breakfast. The body really didn‚Äôt want to get up, felt pretty content in the ole sleeping bag. Finally about 8ish i put my wet socks and shoes on and packed everything up, got it down to about 5 minutes. Stayed at a nice campsite in an open meadow. Made it to greasy creek gap about 11. Greasy Creek Hostel was about 0.6 miles off trail, thought about getting some lunch but kept chugging along. Had my first 1000 ft climb of the day just after Hughes Gap (4040elv). It was pretty steep at sections with the trail being mainly log steps. Got to a beautiful campsite at Ash Gap (5350elv), almost set up camp there it was so nice. Continued on my next climb up to Roan Mountain (6190elv). This was allot of boulder climbing and rock gardens. Luckily I didn‚Äôt have to do this yesterday when it was raining, it would have been miserable. Made on top of Roan Mountain and hit up the highest shelter on the AT, Roan High Knob Shelter (6186elv). Originally planned to stay there tonight but it was too crowded. Headed down the backside of Roan and enjoyed a very dense pine tree forrest, the smell of pine was intense. Got down to Carver Gap about 6ish and made my way up to Round Bald. I‚Äôm so glad I didn‚Äôt decide to stay at the shelter, the view up here is awesome. Pitched my tent on the summit and started dinner. Again, this view i have right outside my tent is killer.

Altra has a cult following among hikers because, all-in-all, they make a good shoe. We've all been waiting for a trail runner that is actually foot shaped and wide for our swelling and splayed feet. However! Until Altra makes a shoe that can stand up to more than 200 miles before completely falling apart, we don't intend to purchase another pair from them. It is very common to hear hikers say they love everything about their Altras except their total lack of durability. Blue had these Timps for less than two weeks/200 miles when he noticed holes on the inside (a place where they commonly blow out). Sunshine's Salomon Odyssey Triple Crowns looked better at 600 miles than Blue's Altra Timps did at 200. (And they are just as wide as the Altras.) He's sewn together two pairs of Altras with floss on the trail, and so have many other hikers. These trail runners might be great for running at home, but if you plan to wear them on the AT, be prepared with double the shoe budget because you'll be replacing them often. @altrarunning  @salomonrunning @salomon<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#shameshame #badreview #disappointed #trailrunners  #appalachiantrail #appalachianthruhike #atclassof2019 #atnobo #atnobo2019 #thruhike #optoutside #hikerhunger #hikertrash #appalachiantrail2019 #hikerfeed"

There is a commonly used phrase out here: ""making miles."" As in, ""I don't stop for lunch because I got miles to make."" I don't want to get caught up in semantics, but I don't like this phrase at all. Us hikers are not ""making"" anything that didn't or couldn't exist without us. The mountains and the miles between them have always been there, and always will be. We are lucky that our feet get to pass over them. Everyone has their own reasons for hiking the AT. Getting to Katahdin as fast as possible is one of them, I guess. But to take such a life-changing and potentially spiritual experience and turn it into a competitive one is not our style. It tends to be a goal among the younger hikers on the trail. They compare miles and talk proudly of how much they did that day. And good for them! But for us, we'd rather be asked what we saw that day or what our favorite moment was. We aren't ""making"" anything...

We've waited awhile for these. We are enjoying feeling strong and upping our mileage. It makes it fun to set short-term goals and meet them. Seeing the 700 mile mark had us specifically thinking about that... How so many steps in a day turn into miles and so many days in a row turn into hundreds of miles. There's been a sense of celebration in the air lately about how far we've come. Bluegrass is particularly jazzed that we are 1/3 through. We could be worried about pace/money/time, but we are choosing not to. We are enjoying the experience and celebrating what we've shown that we are able to do. We are enjoying the people, the pups, and the budding flowers. Sunshine saw rhododendron in bloom for the first time ever... Something we consider nothing more than an invasive weed at home. It was nice to get a new appreciation for it. She's also newly in love with the smell of pine needles under the heat of the sun. She will stop mid-stride to breathe as much of it in as she can. We've loved hiking with Papa Bear and growing our tramily. We've enjoyed the simplest trail magic, such as a Coca-Cola and a chair by a stream on a hot day. As well as the most personal trail magic, such as Jimmy waiting for us at the end of a pasture to surprise us with snacks and slackpacking. The sense of community and love on the trail continues to be the AT's most beautiful trait. And now, after walking 200 miles in two weeks, we are enjoying a restful zero with copious amounts of carbs and perfectly mediocre hotel cable. We feel so lucky to have a chance at this adventure. To grow so much as a couple and as individuals. The AT will give you so much joy and new strength if you let it.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #appalachianthruhike #atclassof2019 #atnobo #atnobo2019 #thruhike #optoutside #hikerhunger #hikertrash #appalachiantrail2019 #hikerfeed"

Finding camping was a bit difficult because we passed through a lot of restrictive areas. A chemical plant, a landfill, a 7 mile switchbacked section with few flat spots for tents, and no water sources for 10+ miles at a time. We pitched our tents near roads and highways a couple times and missed the quiet peaceful woods, where we feel like we belong. With the heat came humidity, bugs, poison ivy, some sleepless nights, and needing to camel up and carry extra water between water sources. We have never been so sweaty. Sunshine's sleeping pad is leaking faster and faster each night, and we weren't able to fix it in the mountains without a bathtub or soapy water to help find the holes. Bluegrass has been Mr.Fix-it between the sleeping pad and his shoes... Yes, the ones he just got 200 miles ago. We will make another post on this later, but we are pretty disappointed with how poorly Altras hold up on the trail. We pushed ourselves on miles this week, and our bodies are showing it.

Or really, the beautiful. <br>Like all other aspects of our marriage, the AT is not just a shared journey. It's also an individual one. We support each other the best we can, but our own feet have to walk the miles. Blue has his unique struggles with the trail and I have mine. One thing we didn't expect was how hard it would be to watch each other work through those struggles independently. On the day of this picture, my feet were in new kinds of pain. I pushed my trail runners too far (600 miles) and they were toast. It was getting late in the day and the clouds were looking threatening. We reached the base of a steep climb and I asked Blue to tell me how many more miles to camp. ""Three,"" he said. ""We are at the base of our last climb."" I couldn't hold back my tears. I didn't feel like I had three more miles. I didn't want to climb in the rain. I asked him for some pain meds and he kindly dropped pack to dig them out for me. I swallowed them fast and before he could put his pack back on, I was long gone. I turned on my most motivating music and pushed as hard as I could. Just then, it POURED down rain. I don't know how I found the mental fortutude to climb that mountain as fast as I did in the downpour, or to ignore the pain throbbing in my shoes. But I did. What I didn't know, was that Blue was trying desperately to catch me. His only thought was that he didn't want me facing that battle alone. Even if he couldn't fix it for me, he wanted to be there. He caught me almost at the top, breathing ragged and with new pains of his own for pushing so hard. We finished the climb together. At the top, we enjoyed the view in silence. Until he tearfully said ""I'm so sorry you hurt."" We shared a good cry and I took this picture to remember the moment. Not of the view, but of us. Because we are the journey. The trail gets real ugly sometimes, but after a few days I find those ugly moments to be the most beautiful. Later that night I realized: this man is my own Katahdin.

Took the pack off and had some lunch, couscous with some extra ramen noodles i had. Meh, it worked ok. I made it to Spivey Gap (333.1) about 2:30pm and started what i thought was my last climb of the day. About half way up I stopped at a water source to wash some of the sweat off my face. As i was doing that a dog walks up, lays right in the stream and starts gulping down water, i just looked at and said ‚Äúyup, i know how you feel buddy!‚Äù.

Which meant i got to stay snuggled in my sleeping bag a little longer, it only lasted about an hour. Packed up camp and headed out. The first 5 miles were nice, a little up and down but most of it flat. It was still overcast and got a few rain showers off and on until about 11:30am. Made it to Walnut Mountain Shelter about 12:15pm and had a quick lunch. I had a few tortillas left, so pulled out some almond butter, pepperoni slices and some tomato basil tuna. Weird combination i know, but it was good. üòù had a little decent into Kale Gap, then a 500ft climb up to Buff Mountain. Got into Deer Park Mountain Shelter(271.1) around 5:30. We were trying to find a campsite before the shelter but the pickings were very slim. We found a few tent pads away from the shelter but still close enough to use the privy. üí© all in all it was a good day. Put in a little more than 16 miles, which leaves us with a 4-5 mile hike into Hot Springs in the morning. üòÅ hopefully be there by breakfast.

He shares his knowledge and interest in history with us as we hike, and we love it because he has a lot of interesting knowledge to share. Papa Bear is independent, confident, and to-the-point.

Up down up down up down. Get to camp. Set up. Collect and filter water. Eat dinner, something processed and packaged. Sleep, sort of. Fitfully and rotating every hour or two like a rotisserie. Wake up. Repeat. And do it all with a moderate amount of consistent pain and few comforts. This is the Virginia Blues. When you've got your daily hikes dialed down to a science and fewer new things are happening each day. What can you do? Pack out some fresh foods from towns if you can. Look at the stars. Soak your feet in a stream. Take longer breaks. Sing and make up games with your friends as you hike. Try not to get in your head. And remind yourself that this is better than the 9-to-5 you left behind. At 600 miles, you know your body can walk.

We figured it was about time for another update. #thegood - miles are coming fast these days and our gear is working really well. We are enjoying our lighter summer packs! Sunshine's plantar fasciitis has been more manageable thanks to compression socks sent by @jo_meyers and stopping every 5 miles or so to massage or soak in a cold stream. It still hurts everyday, but not as bad as it was. Virginia has been beautiful and green. We love seeing the trees wake up and the flowers come out, which is always a positive aspect of all the rain that comes with spring. We are so tired of seeing brown, dead leaves and naked trees... So come on spring! We stayed at Long Neck Lair in Atkins and enjoyed using their kitchen to make a big breakfast. We've been hiking with Papa Bear and really enjoying his company. (Hiker Spotlight soon) #thebad - this heat, man. Days that wouldn't have been tough in cooler temperatures are much harder with the sun sucking your energy dry. There isn't much tree cover so sunburns are bound to happen even with hats and sunscreen. We've been going for long stretches without any water sources too.

A couple hiking down the AT past me as i was heading in to the shelter. I said my usual greetings and they asked if i was through hiking. I said sure am, on day 24.

Many of our days are spent looking at exactly this for hours: dead/dormant trees, dry brown leaves, twigs and felled branches, and scarce appearances of green. That doesn't get shown often because it isn't very ""insta-worthy."" But it is the most accurate depiction of how we spend a lot of our time. Sometimes the only reason we hike is because we need to cover some ground between sleep. Those are the days we put some music in our earbuds, drink caffeine, and find a way to get through it.

Waited about 2 hours to see if the weather would change, it didn‚Äôt, so i went 0.1 miles up trail to find a campsite. The rain had stoped just long enough to get the tent up and all my crap inside. I‚Äôve been laying here, in my tent, since 2:30. The rain has not stopped, I‚Äôm bored, a little wet and i gotta poop. ‚òπÔ∏è Hopefully tomorrow is better.

Sunshine wonders how he picks the perfect rock, but we are sure he does it carefully and with love. Q has a theory about the laws of physics on the AT: what goes up, must go up some more. We hate that he's right, but at least he can joke about it. Q is the kind of person who won't remember the small details of his hike, such as the mileage or the names of the shelters he slept in.

From talking to others, this seems to be a common struggle pairs and couples have on the trail. These days we feel like we are hitting our stride (no pun intended) and have some good compromises established. Habits train the mind, so we essentially tried swapping some roles. Sunshine started setting the alarms and waking Blue up in the mornings. When we decide to stop early for the day due to Sunshine being over it or in pain, she sets a goal for a high mileage day to make up for it. (Apparently it's easier for her to do the hard things when it's her idea.) She is figuring out how to pack up more quickly in the morning. Believe it or not, it was her idea to wake up at 5am today to hike into town before 9am. Bluegrass, on the other hand, has graciously chilled out enough for Sunshine to have her morning coffee everyday. On days where only 10ish miles are planned, we sleep in and he doesn't mind starting at 10:30. He is now in charge of picking the scenic lunch spots. In general, he is sporting a much more laid back and cheerful appreciation of the current moment rather than always thinking about the future. (A big thank you to CBD and mature communication!) We are trying to be better at communicating at the start of the day: is this a leisure day, or a day to kick ass? And we come to an agreement. Basically, we are meeting in the middle and feeling stronger because of it. .<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #appalachianthruhike #atclassof2019 #atnobo #atnobo2019 #thruhike #optoutside #hikerhunger #hikertrash #appalachiantrail2019 #marriage #compromise #hiketogether #staytogether #honestsocialmedia #candid #hikerfeed"

This time our update is going to have more in terms of #thegood rather than #thebad or #theugly . <br>The Good: Where to start? We saw Max Patch in sunny clear weather, which is sort of an AT milestone hikers look forward to. Friends and family have surprised us with visits and treated us with so much love. Hot Springs was a lovely town filled with kind and hospitable people and  surprisingly good beer. We have really found our groove in compromising with our different hiking styles (more on that later) and we feel like we are coming together as an even stronger team than before. Trail angels hooked us up with slackpacking, cowboy camping in their truck, and Sunshine's first ever chilli dog. Bluegrass saw his first shooting star. We saw Big Bald Mountain in the snow and wind and it made our running list of top 10 favorite sights along the AT. Also- NO RAIN?! Seriously. We could keep going.<br><br>The bad: What we thought was altitude sickness was apparently not. Bluegrass seems to have some inner ear issue where he gets dizzy when he is lying down at night. Sunshine has plantar fasciitis, athletes foot, and a gnarly cough. And neither of us have slept well in many nights.<br><br>The ugly: Sunshine had a weird moment where she got all emotional and thought Bluegrass wasn't going to like her anymore by the end of the AT.

Temps got down into the lower 20‚Äôs, I‚Äôm not about that life. ü§£ got a hot shower, laundry done and recharged all my sh!t. Went into town for dinner, went to this awesome Mexican joint and had a mug of beer. The stomach was happy. üòÅ woke up the next morning and some of the guys were making eggs, bacon and biscuits, annihilated that. Packed my gear and caught the 8oclock shuttle back to the AT. First climb up Tray Mountain (pictured) was killer, had to burn off that breakfast. üòí the rest of the day was uneventful, a few climbs here and there but nothing to write about. Had the ear buds in most of the day. Using the inspirational lyrics of Alter Bridge to get me through the day. Got into Addis Gap about 3:30 for a 12 mile day. Legs are sore and still have the knot in my back, working that out as i type this. Foods in the belly and trying to stay warm. Low of 29 tonight. Thanks for the love and support.

I fear i have been welcomed by new neighbors.ü§£ü§¢<br>Didn‚Äôt sleep very good last night, every position had my back hurting. I‚Äôm not much of a side sleeper but have noticed i have been the past few nights. Might need to invest in a light weight air bed. <br>Started the day with a nice ascent up Levelland Mountain(200ft) to get the blood pumping. Past a few thru hikers still packing their stuff up. Made it over Cowrock Mountain(pictured) into Tesnatee Gap. There was a small parking lot where day hikers could go up Cowrock and see the views. Took my pack off to put my shorts on, it was warm, mid 70‚Äôs i think. As i was doing that a family pulls up and asks me ‚Äúhow far do these trails go?‚Äù I pointed back in the direction i came and said ‚Äúabout 50 miles that way‚Äù and if you go this way (pointing in the direction i was going) ‚Äúyou can walk all the way to Maine‚Äù. The look of bafflement on their face was hilarious. I had to explain, Maine the state, the one up by canada. ü§£ the next question ‚Äúare there any 2-3 mile hikes around?‚Äù üôÑ i pointed them up Cowrock to see the views. ‚õ∞<br>So I continued up Wildcat Mountain(3637ft) a very steep 600ft climb, short but intense. Made it into Hogpen Gap by 1pm where a local church had set up some trail magic. Ice cold lemonade and 2 chocolate moon pies had my name all over it. üò¨ sat there and mingled for about a half hour then got back on trail. Past by Low Gap Shelter about 2, it was too early to stop. Hiked 2 more miles to Poplar Stamp Gap and set up camp. Set the tent up and sealed the seams with seam sealer i bought back at Neels Gap. Only one other thru hiker with me tonight. Temps are supposed to fall into the 20‚Äôs tomorrow night so will be heading into town. Thanks for the love and support. Have a great Saturday night!

I‚Äôm usually the last one out of camp. But i gotta have my coffee in the morning ü§§. It was a long gradual climb up Blood Mountain. Started to get a knot the day before on my right shoulder blade. Was trying every different stretch to try and ease the burn for a little bit while i was walking. Got to the top of Blood Mountain and the view was epic. Pretty touristy spot and was pretty crowded so didn‚Äôt stay long. Knees held up great on the 1300ft down the backside. Walked into Neels Gap and thought we were getting trail magic, seen canopies set up along the road. It was so much better, Brenau University was raising money for their school and offering thru hikers free back massages. Hell yeah!! Just what i needed. This sweet young girl worked the knots out of my dirty sweaty back for like 15 minutes. Just what i needed üòÅ. Went into Neel Gap Gift Shop and demolished a full sausage & pepperoni pizza and diet coke. Was able to charge a few things while i waited and ate some more. With a full belly and happy soul i headed up to Bull Gap Camp. Chillen with a few thru hikers and headen to bed. Today was a great day. Thanks for all the love and support.

Did the normal morning routine and bid good fortune to the other hikers that are just way more motivated than me in the morning. A couple i camped with had their food bags chewed through by mice.

He noticed a few times, a dark shadow running over his rain fly but couldn‚Äôt hear anything, fast little bastards. ü§£ mostly easy climbing to start out with. Made the ascent up Ramrock Mountain, which had the best few on the AT yet. Made it to Woody Gap and called a shuttle to take me into Suches, GA for a quick resupply. I had enough food for lunch and dinner but was running short on snacks. I wanna throw a shout out to Uber Steve Shuttle Service (scuba steves ugly cousin). I was picked up, driven to town, got snacks and drove back all within 20 minutes. Hell yeah! Took a short siesta and headed back on trail. Made the ascent up Big Cedar Mountain, with another great view. Got into camp about 5ish and literally took the last site. üò§ all in all it was a good day.

It took allot to muster up the motivation to get out of the sleeping bag, but once i was out, things warmed up quick. The day started out rather easy with a few up and downs. kinda like going down some moguls, You go up the mountain and come down the mountain and dry rinse repeat. Once i hit Sassafras Mountain it was show time. Climbed up the gradual 800ft to Sassafras and the 400ft down to Cooper Gap. Took lunch at Cooper Gap(mile 12.2) and talked to few other thru hikers that were doing the same. Climbed up and over Justus Mountain(mile 14.3) and set up camp just passed Justus Creek.

The morning on Springer Mountain started out foggy and dreary, but by mid day, the clouds had cleared and the sun was shining. Ran into allot of day hikers coming down the backside of Springer. I hit Three Forks(mile 4.3) around lunch time, meet a few more people taking there attempt at thru hiking, then sat and had lunch by the river. Pictured here is the sign for the Hickory Flats Cemetery. It was 0.2 miles off trail so I didn‚Äôt go check it out. ü§£ got into Hawk Mountain Campsite around 3. Set up camp and let the tent dry off from the rain that morning. (nothing like rolling up a wet cold tent to start the day off.) üôÑ picked a nice site with a fire pit down the hill from the trail. Got a fire started and not 20 minutes later it started raining (fricken great üò§). After that, i just laid in the mobile home and planned out the adventure for tomorrow.

For us this week, the difficulties were with figuring out what it means to ""hike your own hike"" when you are a married couple hiking together and you both have very different hiking styles. Bluegrass is early to sleep and early to rise. He wants to do big miles and challenge himself. He monitors his pace so he can reach his destination early and fit the most into the day. He is streamlined with his stoveless breakfast and dutiful ability to wake up to the first alarm. He's a ""snack while walking"" kind of guy who usually has to back-track a few feet when we walks past a good view. He has a plan forming in his head for about 4-5 days into the future on the AT at all times. Sunshine thinks mornings are hard because she was up for hours the night before thinking and writing while the other hikers snored. She wants hot coffee and Carnation breakfast in her sleeping bag before she gets anything done on a cold morning. She stops to take pictures of mushrooms and pinecones and vistas. She wants to take breaks to lay in the sun when she passes the perfect spot. She doesn't get there fast, but she gets there eventually. What does that mean for us and how we hike together? We don't know yet. Sunshine admits she could be more disciplined and thoughtful about the future. Blue admits he could relax a bit and learn to enjoy the little moments. We are working compromises into our daily routines and figuring it out. But it isn't easy!<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #appalachianthruhike #atclassof2019 #atnobo #atnobo2019 #thruhike #optoutside #hikerhunger #hikertrash #appalachiantrail2019"

The only re-supply option is in Gatlinburg, which is far away from the trail, expensive, and infested with tourists.  Thru-hikers are also mandated in the Smokys to sleep in shelters unless they are full. But we have to give up our spots to other hikers who made reservations for shelter space. That means you can be sound asleep in a full shelter, and a family of 5 can walk in at 10pm with reservations and rightfully kick you out. Luckily this didn't happen to us, but we didn't enjoy the stress of never knowing where we would sleep. We hiked through the park during spring break with excellent weather, which means it was crowded with section hikers and families on weekend trips. We love meeting people on the trail, but sharing a shelter with these folks is tricky. They want to build a fire and play games and stay up until 11pm and then sleep-in the next day. Whereas the thrus are in their quilts by 7:45pm and up again at 6am. Earplugs (for both parties) can only do so much. Secondly, Bluegrass started to feel some altitude sickness and that royally sucked. Sunshine fell down pretty hard and ripped her favorite pair of leggings. And, our last complaint, THOSE WATER BARS. (Second picture). For the love of God. We would rather hike through mud and streams than hoist our tired bodies up these two-foot steps repeatedly, or ruin our knees by taking hard and heavy steps down them. We tried walking around them. We tried alternating our feet. It doesn't matter. These things hurt. And they are all over the Smokys. .<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #appalachianthruhike #atclassof2019 #atnobo #atnobo2019 #thruhike #optoutside #hikerhunger #hikertrash #appalachiantrail2019 #thegoodthebadtheugly"

Thru-hikers love 'em or hate 'em. We will split the middle and just call it a love/hate relationship. As usual, we want to share our candid update by including the good, the bad, and the ugly. But this time, each one will need a post of it's own. So let's start now with the good stuff.<br><br>The Good: We had uncharacteristically great weather every day. Windy and cold, yes. But sunny and clear every darn day, and that's unheard of for the Smokys. The clear skies meant we enjoyed our best views on the AT so far. We summited a mountain during a golden sunset. We passed through our first conifer forest, and it felt like a sanctuary. We stared into endless blue mountains under crystal skies. We walked slowly through frosty wonderlands. We enjoyed aromas of pine and spruce that were intensified by the sun. Truly the most beautiful parts of the trail so far. We don't have the proverbial ""trail legs"" yet, but the Smoky Mountains will mark the point where we first started to feel like thru-hikers. Where we noticed that we don't need to stop to catch our breath while hiking 2.5 mph up a mountain. Where we started to schedule lunch time around the scenery instead of the time of day or state of our stomachs (we can always eat anyway). Where we decided it was worth the weight to carry a can of Pringles or 8oz tub of mayonnaise. Where we smelled just as bad to the day hikers as they smelled lovely to us. The Smokys were challenging and annoying. But they have changed us, and we aren't mad about it. .<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #appalachianthruhike #atclassof2019 #atnobo #atnobo2019 #thruhike #optoutside #hikerhunger #hikertrash #appalachiantrail2019 #smokymountains #gsmnp #thegood #thebad #theugly"

If he thinks you need it, he might pull out a piece of dove chocolate from no where and throw it your direction. He has a wit and a quiet peace about him that make his presence feel like a hidden treasure. When he opens his mouth, it is either to say something meaningful or to make you smile. We think the world could use more people like these two. The only thing we don't like about them is how hard it is to catch up to them on the trail! No matter how much time passes between seeing them, they are family to us.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #atclassof2019 #atnobo2019 #atthruhike #thruhike #thruhiker #hikertrash #hikerhunger #hikerspotlight #love"

We desperately did not want to leave the trail, but figured the warning of potential blow-downs was worth heeding. We hiked 5.2 miles downhill to get to Cade's Cove. And yes, as we said, only 0.2 of those miles were on the AT. Tomorrow we will need to hike those 5 miles UP to get back to the trail. BUT: We got to sunbathe in the grass area of a parking lot. We got a free ride into town from a generous day hiker. A fellow hiker bought our room, so we are buying his dinner whether he likes it or not. We showered and brought our dirty clothes in with us to do ""hiker laundry"" with a bar of soap. We are about to take a trolley around town to get our re-supply. A friend hooked us up with a ride back to the trail tomorrow.

We call him Mr.Logistics because of his strength in helping hikers plan their journey one section at a time. Sunshine's favorite thing about him is his genuine smile when he sees a tired hiker emerging from the mountains, successfully finishing their hike for the day. I Believe has a resilient and humble strength about her, which you will only get to know if you get her talking about her AT experience. Ask her questions and ask for her advice. She has nothing to prove, but is a wellspring of wisdom when you get her going. She has a childlike joy about her that will inspire you to hug her regularly. She also makes a mean Mexican casserole. These two have blessed us immeasurably with their stories, rides in their truck, opportunities to slack-pack difficult sections, home-cooked meals, and their belief in our ability to get to Katahdin.

If you catch him singing, it will always be ""Last Nite"" by The Strokes. He stays positive and friendly and all times. He is self-sacrificing and chivalrous. He is generous with his uplifting words and affirmation toward others. And occasionally he talks about pizza in his sleep. He is also really excited about his new beard, which he puts essential oils in every day to boost his morale while hiking.

But we weren't sure how we were going to travel 11 miles up the road from Dicks Creek Gap to Hiawasee. They say out here that ""the trail provides,"" and you just can't know how true that is until you get here. We met some hikers today who were planning on meeting their parents at Dicks Creek for a ride to Hiawasee, and they offered their truck bed to us. Not only that, but when we finally arrived to the parking lot, they asked ""do you want a cold beer?!"" Now after a long day that started at 5am, formalities were out the window, and we answered honestly: YES! So there we found ourselves, sipping a beer in the sun in the back of someone's truck we didn't know this morning. This is the trail, y'all. (Oh and they insisted on buying us tacos...

I had just said goodbye to a couple of dear friends, the last thing I said being, ‚ÄúGod takes care of His children,‚Äù which is some wisdom I have been practicing for a couple of years now. I didn‚Äôt mean this in a strictly Christian sense, but more whether you have love in your heart, and act unselfishly. More spiritual than religious. When I went to start the car and leave, I had the stereo on The Joint to enjoy some reggae. Just listen to the chorus of this song that starts again at about the 1:10 mark. It goes, ‚ÄúGooooood bless the children!,‚Äù and repeats. Now I also just realized as I type this that we are at AT northbound mile 110, 110 miles from the beginning of the Appalachian Trail at Springer Mountain. All I can say is, ‚ÄúWow...‚Äù Praise Jah!!!<br>#zenintheforest #at110 #atnobo2019 #atnobomile110 #goodergrovehostel #goodergrove #outsidefranklinnc"

Starting at Springer Mountain, Georgia and ending at Mt. Katahdin, Maine, the trail travels through 14 different states and at nearly 2,200 miles long is the longest ‚Äúhiking only‚Äù foot path. The AT is one of three long trails in the U.S. that include the Pacific Crest Trail (CDT) on the west coast and the Continental Divide Trail (CDT) in the American Heartland. All three are known as The Triple Crown. üëë‚Å£<br>‚Å£<br>I will be posting daily updates and will be releasing videos approximately every 3-4 days (depending on cell signal) while on trail. You can follow me on instagram at ‚ÄúScott.The.Bald‚Äù and head over to my YouTube channel to receive quicker updates. ‚Å£<br>‚Å£<br>Most of the people around me already knew i had been planning this. Feels like I‚Äôve been talking about it for almost 5 years (probably cause i haveü§£). ‚Å£<br>‚Å£<br>Again, SUPER excited to get this news out to everyone and SUPER excited to get out on trail and start the next EPIC adventure.
