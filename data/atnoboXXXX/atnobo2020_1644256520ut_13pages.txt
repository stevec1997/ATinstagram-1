That little strip of dirt, 18‚Äù wide and 2,193 miles long, completely changed my life. I remember finding the trail sign at Newfound Gap in the Smokies (Feb 11, 2019) that inspired me to google ‚Äúhike the Appalachian Trail‚Äù. I remember when I was in Chicago with a show the next month and told somebody else for the first time that I was considering hiking the whole AT the next year. And I remember sitting in the beach chairs in Logan Airport‚Äôs Terminal C, looking out on the runways, about to fly down to Atlanta to start the hike, and KNOWING that this was a big moment. I am such a different person now than I was at any of those three points. And I‚Äôm even more different today, but every choice I make is influenced by lessons I learned and people I met on trail. ‚ù§Ô∏è Free Fall #appalachiantrail #atclassof2020 #atnobo2020 #thruhike #thruhiker #game #lifeisbeautiful

Unfortunately we had to skip this section due to high snow and icy ground in the park and making it difficult to traverse. BUT we made sure to come back and finish this section so we could say we hiked all the miles but also cause we wanted to see the ponies like we were promised. ü•∞ I was so happy we got to see them at Massie Gap and then again a little further up on trail, but they decided to run away when we got close the second time since there was a baby with them. Oh well at least I got to see them twice in one day! <br>‚Ä¢<br>‚Ä¢<br>‚Ä¢<br>‚Ä¢<br>‚Ä¢<br> #appalachiantrail #AT2020 #ATnobo2020 #ATFlipFlop2020 #ATsobo2020 #appalachiantrail2020 #appalachianlife #ATclassof2020 #trektheat #thetrek #withguthook #hikemoreworryless #optoutside #wekeepyououtdoors #hikertrash #thruhike #hikerlife #getlost #backpacking #hikerlife #outdoorlife #hiking #adventure #wanderlust

My heart aches to go back, to do it again, to retrace my memories and to make new ones. I want to sleep directly under the stars and meet more people who follow their big dreams. I want to eat more stacks of pancakes before leaving towns and feel my heart pump as I spot the sign on the top of Katahdin. I‚Äôve almost forgotten how amazing a shower feels after hiking for days. I want to walk this trail over and over. I get asked whether I am forgetting the bad, that it couldn‚Äôt be this fantastic. Not all adventures are pony rides in May sunshine, said J.R. Tolkien in the Hobbit. But even when I busted my wrist or my knee wanted to give out, I didn‚Äôt want to be anywhere else. I lived an adventure every day. I never knew what view I would find at the top of the next mountain, who I would meet and what would happen. I appreciated living, and was present for it. I itch for that kind of magic. I aim to continue living a life so full. <br><br>#appalachiantrailthruhike #appalachiantrailclassof2020 #atnobo2020 #atsobo2020 #womenwhohike

As a result of my job I‚Äôve been diagnosed with PTSD and major depressive disorder- severe. COVID has wrecked me and made me question everything I once knew about life. <br>I‚Äôve always wanted to hike the AT and after the year I‚Äôve had on the covid unit, I owe it to myself to do something that makes me happy. My last day at my job is 4/8/21 and I‚Äôll be working odd jobs until my AT hike so that I‚Äôll have time to travel and get some hiking knowledge under my belt. I plan to start my hike in mid-late February 2022. My goal in hiking the AT is to rediscover who I was before COVID destroyed me and to find inner peace. <br>Thanks for following my adventures! ‚ú®<br>*<br>*<br>**<br>*<br>*<br>**<br>#mentalhealth #mentalhealthawareness #mentalhealthmatters #mentalwellness #mentalhealthrecovery #ptsd #ptsdawareness #ptsdrecovery #womenwhothruhike #womenwhohike #hikersofinstagram #hikersofig #hikingforrecovery #appalachiantrail #at2022 #hiker #hiking #hikingva #virginiahiking #blueridgemountains #atnobo2020 #socialworker

Every day I think about what I achieved from last year and how much fun it was to run through the mountains. Good luck to everyone starting their thru-hikes this year.

Thru-hiking a long distance trail really does ‚Äúruin‚Äù your life, in a good way. It just so happened that @hikeryearbook hosted a 2020 trail family reunion on Zoom tonight, and words cannot express the joy I felt seeing all the faces of my friends that I haven‚Äôt seen since September (or earlier).

And of all the things that did come out of my 2,193 mile journey - miles, snakes, PBR, vert, bears, thunderstorms, and a lot of memories - still the most important part, one year later, was the people. It‚Äôs painfully cliche to say, but the people you meet are truly the best part of the experience. (Also, a lesson learned for the next trail is to take more photos of PEOPLE, not places) I love all the people in these photos so much ‚ù§Ô∏è #appalachiantrail #atnobo2020 #atclassof2020 #thruhike #tramily

The northern half of PA (in my opinion, sorta starting in Duncannon but REALLY starting in Port Clinton) is known for having long stretches of randomly placed, sharp, slippery rocks. They are just waiting to twist your ankle or make you fall AND they hide black, copperhead, and rattlesnakes within them! I remember the few times I fell on the rocks I bolted back to my feet as fast as I could because I was sure I was about to be bitten üòÇ Ironically, the closest I came to a rattlesnake was on a perfectly flat stretch of dirt trail. I was going along when I heard the rattle (which I‚Äôll never forget), jumped backwards, and looked and saw the head of the snake about 6‚Äù off trail in the grass from where I had been standing! #appalachiantrail #atnobo2020 #atclassof2020 #thruhike #snakes

I remember leaving Gorham, NH with the knowledge that I was going to cross my final state border that day... and I was SO EXCITED! Midway through the afternoon, I climbed a ladder (I think... or scrambled up a rock..?) and then there was the NH/ME border sign! Almost immediately, Maine showed its true colors with a tough but beautiful climb up to the Goose Eyes. I remember standing on stop of those peaks for a long time, taking in the view around me and wishing I could stay there forever. I specifically remembering giving myself a sore neck that night because I was absolutely enamored but the perfect patchwork quilt of clouds in the sky. Almost every day in Southern ME was like this - killer climb, but then breathtaking views. It was the perfect way to begin to close out the thru hike. #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #atclassof2020 #thruhike

It was just @brivanv and I hiking together at this point, and it had been raining steadily for the past two days. This section of trail is notable because of the 300 stone steps down to the waterfall, the waterfall itself, and the tiny rock ledge that the trail follows alongside the river. When we were there, the river was so swollen, it was just below the lip of the rock ledge - any higher and we would have needed to take the blue blaze alternate up on the ridge. For the rest of the day, we crossed across the river multiple times on these cool bridges and ended it with McDonalds and a night at @blackbearhampton! #appalachiantrail #atnobo2020 #atclassof2020 #thruhike

It could be something small like a Gatorade or snickers at a road crossing, or something really BIG like a half-dozen water caches in the middle of summer. I was the beneficiary of so much selfless kindness from strangers, it really made me change my outlook to assume the best out of the people you meet. I can‚Äôt even count how many times I was having a rough morning or afternoon and then I turn the corner before the next road crossing, and there‚Äôs a cooler sitting right there! Before the trail, I couldn‚Äôt tell you what motivated these people to spend their time and money on us, but now, after being a member of the trail community, I understand it 100%, and I look forward to getting back to the East Coast at some point later this year to pay the generosity I experienced forward. #appalachiantrail #atnobo2020 #atclassof2020 #thruhike #trailmagic

The whole group was broken up - Rudy and Monk in front, me and old friend from @stationat19e Cliff Walker in the middle, and Billy in the back. I was up on a ridge, about 2 miles from our intended campsite, when all of the sudden, the whole sky turned a deep yellow and we could hear a sound like a freight train coming at us from a distance. A couple moments later, the wind was upon us and trees were being blown over across the trail, branches were being ripped off their trunks and whipped at us, and Cliff and I essentially just stood with our backs to each other and watched opposite directions for falling trees. It was so loud, we were yelling at each other to be heard despite being literally back to back. The storm didn‚Äôt take too long to pass over us, and it seems like as soon as the wind stopped, both of our phones‚Äô emergency alerts sounded with National Weather Service ‚Äútake shelter‚Äù alerts üòÇ When we caught up to Rudy and Monk at the campsite, we found that it was utterly destroyed by downed trees, with many cutting directly across established campsites - had someone stayed in their tent during the storm, they almost certainly would have been crushed. It turns out that a tornado had touched down a few miles north, over the border into SW Massachusetts. None of us felt safe sleeping in the woods that night with all the hang-fire still caught up above us, so we pushed on a few more miles into town to sleep in the backyard of Toymaker‚Äôs Cafe. To top it all off, when I mentioned that we were thru hikers, we found a pizza place a few towns over that would deliver! Night made üòä The last photo in the set was taken by @imachimp and is my favorite photo ever of @brivanv, taken the moment we all reunited after the storm. #appalachiantrail #atnobo2020 #atclassof2020 #thruhiker

We stopped in initially just for dinner, a shower, and a bunk but ended up taking a zero. And thank god we did - it was easily one of the most restful and recharging zero‚Äôs of the AT for me. With a big library of books and magazines and no cell service, there was nothing else to do but sit on the porch and read. They ask that guests do not partake in alcohol or drugs while staying there. All the meals are homemade using ingredients from the farm and garden. This is one of those places that I want to go back to and I want all my friends and family to experience that hospitality and connection to nature. #appalachiantrail #atnobo2020 #atclassof2020 #thruhiker #hostel

A little while later, Rudy had a surprise allergic reaction to the stings and we all posted up for almost 4 hours waiting for the symptoms to pass. She‚Äôs an utter badass, and insisted on hiking the remaining 11 miles to the Warwick Drive-Inn, where we all camped for free and watch the Blake Shelton concert. The next day, @peytonbecker and @colin716 picked me up at a road crossing and hosted me at their house for incredible day of homecooked food by the lake (and I slept in a real bed!) The next day, I crossed into NY and got ice cream for lunch, but otherwise had a bit of a downer of a hot, dry day - I stopped after only 17 miles and camped by myself next to a lake. The next day, I said ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù and road walked 3 miles into Tuxedo, NY where I originally planned on just getting some snacks from the gas station, but ended up staying at the very cute Tuxedo Motel (where I saw Wild and 5-0!) I left the next morning with a pep in my step and crossed the Hudson River at Bear Mountain, a milestone I had been looking forward to for days. On the AT, (in my experience) you are almost never just flat emotionally, it‚Äôs big swings from one extreme to another - the AT roller coaster! #atnobo2020 #atclassof2020 #thruhiker

Washington is the pinnacle of the Presidential Traverse, a 12+ mile exposed traverse above treeline on the AT. I had hiked the mountain twice before, never being able to see further than 10‚Äô in front of me at the summit (their claim of having the worst weather in America is no joke!), and somehow, BOTH times I climbed to its summit during my thru-hike I had clear, unobstructed views. The first summit photo was taken after a long push from Ethan Pond (on the other side of Crawford Notch) and shortly after, I decided to hitch down the auto road into North Conway because I was too cold and exhausted to walk two more miles down to tree line. After a zero to recuperate, I re-hiked to the summit from Pinkham Notch (the second summit photo) and finished off the northern half of the traverse. #appalachiantrail #atnobo2020 #atclassof2020 #thruhiker

We had spent an incredible night @barndoorhostel before getting dropped off in the AM and starting the climb up. I got the summit first, and the sky was already starting to turn and the wind starting to gust. Once Rudy, Buckler, and Monk joined me on top, the rain (hail?) had started and given how exposed the summit of Moosilauke is, we decided we couldn‚Äôt afford to wait for Billie to catch us, so we started down the very, very steep descent in an absolute deluge. The most *interesting* section was the wooden steps bolted (glued?) into long rock slabs... and some were missing, leading to big steps down. Once we got off the section that follows a ravine down, the storm had cleared, and we found a nice campsite right before Kinsman Notch and dried everything out by the fire. #appalachiantrail #atnobo2020 #atclassof2020 #thruhiker #wmnf #whitemountains

Every day this month, I want to highlight a set of photos and the story that goes along with them, because the AT is about so much more than pretty views and crushing miles. ‚Äî Today, I want to talk about the day we met @amanda.e.kaye and slept in an old schoolhouse. Leaving Marion, VA I was with Wild, Fixin, and Silky when we came across an injured hiker on the trail. Wild and Silky helped the hiker and carried their pack the 6 miles round trip back to a road. When they got back, we decided to cut our day short and stop at the Lindamood School House on the Settlers Museum. Forward (Amanda) met us there with cupcakes, PBR, and snack trail magic! My birthday was the day before, so she had great timing! Later that day, the Reverend and his mother came by with a resupply box for @wildonthetrail AND a Dominos pizza for us! That night, we tried to cowboy camp on the schoolhouse porch, but were forced inside by rain around 11. It was still pretty cool to sleep around all the desks and the old wood stove. Oh, AND the schoolhouse held a big plastic bin filled with candy, stocked by local trail angels. A wonderful, trail magic-filled day! #atnobo2020 #atclassof2020 #thruhiker #appalachiantrail

I remember this sense of accomplishment rush over me. I knew I wasn‚Äôt done hiking the trail yet and that I was only halfway done at that point. But I had still made it halfway and climbed one of the hardest mountains on the AT. Once I made it to the top, I knew I could finish the whole trail.

As a dietitian I wouldn‚Äôt usually recommend a supplement like a greens powder to my clients. You can easily get the micronutrients you need through eating a balanced diet. However, for those who are familiar with the trail, there is no ‚Äúbalance‚Äù to anyone‚Äôs diet. Although I have made my own backpacking food that I‚Äôll mail out, which I carefully  chose ingredients for, I want to be absolutely sure I cover my bases for micronutrients. This greens powder plus some vitamins (multi, joint, D, iron-for my own needs) will be enough security to help my body get to Katahdin! In order of best to worst, here was my ranking!<br>1)Clean Greens (tastes like sweet tea)<br>2)Sweet Berry<br>3)Lemon Lime<br>4)Berry<br>5)Watermelon<br>6)Chocolate<br>I know these can be pricey so I will most likely will only take a couple per week...

More snow accumulated over night and once we got higher in elevation it was very noticeable. The snow drifts made walking extremely difficult. We were supposed to go up and over the Grayson Highlands but we were so slow going with all the snow we were unable to make it to where we wanted to be. We bailed out and got off before we could make it there. We felt like we needed to prioritize our safety over getting to see the ponies and the views. We have decided to skip that area until next spring when the snow is gone and we know the ponies will be out and about. We also wanted to do trail magic next year at some point so we plan to just do it all at one time next year! Only a few miles left which we will finish on the 3rd! <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #AT2020 #ATnobo2020 #ATFlipFlop2020 #ATsobo2020 #appalachiantrail2020 #appalachianlife #ATclassof2020 #StillOnTheAT #trektheat #thetrek #withguthook #hikemoreworryless #optoutside #wekeepyououtdoors #hikertrash #thruhike #hikerlife #getlost #backpacking #hikerlife #outdoorlife #hiking #adventure #wanderlust

I‚Äôve never hiked in snow before and quickly realized it‚Äôs a whole different game! Our hiking pace dropped a little bit but we still managed to get to our final destination of the day just after sunset. I managed to stay warm all day except during lunch even with a fire at the shelter from another hiker drying out his clothes. My feet were my only problem since my socks and shoes soaked through. But once we started hiking again they warmed back up. We occasionally got some deep snow but managed to make it through just fine! <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #AT2020 #ATnobo2020 #ATFlipFlop2020 #ATsobo2020 #appalachiantrail2020 #appalachianlife #ATclassof2020 #StillOnTheAT #trektheat #thetrek #withguthook #hikemoreworryless #optoutside #wekeepyououtdoors #hikertrash #thruhike #hikerlife #getlost #backpacking #hikerlife #outdoorlife #hiking #adventure #wanderlust

It was a surprisingly easy day! The day began in a rhododendron tunnel for several miles before climbing up and walking a ridge area for most of the day. The climb down from angel‚Äôs rest overlook was pretty steep but manageable. We did 26 miles in about 9 hours which made me feel great! Knees were pretty sore when we got back to the hostel so I pretty much laid in bed the rest of the evening. The weather wasn‚Äôt supposed to be the greatest this day so we had decided to slack this section but we got surprised with a beautiful day! Very thankful for the break in crappy weather to let us knock out the big miles and put us ahead of schedule! It helped for sure because the weather for the next week is not looking so good.. Fingers crossed it changes because right now we are facing rain and snow on/off for the next 7-10 days. 140 miles left and we plan to push big miles on the days that are clear and figure out what to do on the bad days. Might be some more slack packing unfortunately on those days to just get some miles in but not be completely miserable. I‚Äôm all about hike your own hike so if you don‚Äôt like what we‚Äôre doing/planning, then unfollow me. This year has not been a typical thru-hike. We have had to be very flexible in our hike and make it the best we can. Only a week left on trail! Going to try and enjoy every last bit! <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #AT2020 #ATnobo2020 #ATFlipFlop2020 #ATsobo2020 #appalachiantrail2020 #appalachianlife #ATclassof2020 #StillOnTheAT #trektheat #thetrek #withguthook #hikemoreworryless #optoutside #wekeepyououtdoors #hikertrash #thruhike #hikerlife #getlost #backpacking #hikerlife #outdoorlife #hiking #adventure #wanderlust

It was so cold that I had to put my trekking poles away and walk with my hands in my pockets. I‚Äôd occasionally hide behind some rocks and take a break from the wind. After several miles we finally dropped back into the valley although it was still cold but not as windy. We got to see the oldest oak tree on the AT in the south (Keffer Oak). Now the story about the glove pic, I had dropped them and didn‚Äôt realize for about a mile. So I added 2 miles onto my day for a pair of gloves. I was ticked and then right after that I lost my nose ring. It was a rough day. The next day we woke up and climbed back up to another ridge and once again it was windy and cold but this time there was snow! It was a long day and this time we beat our biggest mileage and hiked 28 miles! Why? We quickly realized that we couldn‚Äôt camp up on the ridge and had to bail out and go to town so we hiked an extra 3 miles to a road and made it to town and got warm. The weather is quickly turning colder than we anticipated and are prepared for so now the real planning has begun to figure out how to finish the last little bit of trail..<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #AT2020 #ATnobo2020 #ATFlipFlop2020 #ATsobo2020 #appalachiantrail2020 #appalachianlife #ATclassof2020 #StillOnTheAT #trektheat #thetrek #withguthook #hikemoreworryless #optoutside #wekeepyououtdoors #hikertrash #thruhike #hikerlife #getlost #backpacking #hikerlife #outdoorlife #hiking #adventure #wanderlust

We slack packed again and went from Apple Orchard Mt to the James River. Starting at 4200 ft in elevation at 7:30 was a bit cold! We were in all our cold weather gear but our hands were still frozen so we put our poles in our bag and hiked with our hands in our pockets for a majority of the morning! Luckily we were going downhill most of the day. A few climbs here and there helped keep us warm. We found a spot that was blocked by the wind and in the sun so we stopped for lunch in the middle of the trail. Sometimes you just gotta do what you gotta do. We saw so much ice coming out of the ground or on the side of rocks. It is definitely turning into winter out here! Time to get a move on! <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #AT2020 #ATnobo2020 #ATFlipFlop2020 #ATsobo2020 #appalachiantrail2020 #appalachianlife #ATclassof2020 #StillOnTheAT #trektheat #thetrek #withguthook #hikemoreworryless #optoutside #wekeepyououtdoors #hikertrash #thruhike #hikerlife #getlost #backpacking #hikerlife #outdoorlife #hiking #adventure #wanderlust

Like how can 7 months of long, exhausting (but also amazing) days be such a blur? I sometimes feel like it never even happened. When you get thrown back into society after an experience like this and realize everything is the same as how you left it... it hits hard. I won‚Äôt ever be the same... but thank God for that! <br>‚Ä¢<br>‚Ä¢<br>Oh and that‚Äôs Mt. Washington (üôÑ) in front of me! The day before this picture was taken, my tramily and I hiked up Mt. Washington in 90 mph winds. It was freezing cold and when we got to the top we found out we couldn‚Äôt get a shuttle ride down (thanks Covid). If you look closely, you can see a road... well long story short we ended up having to walk down that road to get off the mountain... it was 7 miles long. üôÉ We ended up finishing our hike at like 9:30 pm. It wassss... an experience üòÑ<br>‚Ä¢<br>#atnobo2020 #hikingnh #atnobo #appalachiantrail

The day prior, my friends and I had climbed and descended Blood Mountain in a blowing rainstorm. I was in so much pain from my right knee that the descent took me the better part of 2 and a half hours. Cold, wet, and almost in tears from the pain, I was fucking elated to make it down Blood Mtn and get to Neel Gap - a major milestone (30 miles into the trail). The group of 7(ish?) of us decided to split two cabins at Blood Mountain Cabins to dry off and warm up.  The next day, the weather had not improved much, and as you can see from the photo, I got wet again. But I remember wanting to take this photo of myself because in that moment I felt like I was truly on trail, that this was really happening, and that I was happy to be there. I wish I could go back now and tell Day 4 of 160 Zach (I didn‚Äôt have a trail name yet) that he won‚Äôt believe what is about to happen on trail and what those experiences will do to change him. To keep that smile on, even though there are some truly challenging days ahead. My two month anniversary of touching the sign on Katahdin is tomorrow... and the last month of readjusting has been tough... tougher than the first month. I long to be back in Day 4 Zach‚Äôs shoes - even if they are soaked and muddy. #appalachiantrail #atnobo2020 #atclassof2020 #neelgap #thruhike #thruhiker

The temperatures at night decided to drop into the low 20‚Äôs/high teens and we were not ready for that. The benefit of slackpacking is that we were able to knock out about 22 miles and still enjoy the day. Although one of the climbs was long and hard, it was a pretty great day! We got some pretty great views throughout the day, it was pretty windy again and made it pretty cold most of the day but we made it out alive. We got back to the hostel and after ‚Äúchores‚Äù I passed out and slept so good. <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #AT2020 #ATnobo2020 #ATFlipFlop2020 #ATsobo2020 #appalachiantrail2020 #appalachianlife #ATclassof2020 #StillOnTheAT #trektheat #thetrek #withguthook #hikemoreworryless #optoutside #wekeepyououtdoors #hikertrash #thruhike #hikerlife #getlost #backpacking #hikerlife #outdoorlife #hiking #adventure #wanderlust

It was below freezing so I stayed in my sleeping bag until I absolutely had to get up üòÇ We had a short day planned to get to town so I wasn‚Äôt to worried about getting up and leaving. After hiking for a bit I remembered I felt something on my butt in the middle of the night that I couldn‚Äôt deal with due to it being dark. I unfortunately realized that I had a tick embedded and the site looked extremely irritated. It had probably been there for a day or so. (I‚Äôve gotta get better at doing nightly tick checks..) We immediately removed it and began the steps on getting some doxycycline (thanks mom for all the work!!). My biggest fear out on the trail is getting Lyme Disease. Fingers crossed this tick was not a carrier and/or I caught it and got the meds in time. <br>We had run into Michigan Mille 2 days before (again!) and were so glad we got to hang out with her for the past few days. Although this is probably the last time we will see her, I‚Äôm so glad we got to hang out and hike together one last time (for real this time? We shall see) <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #AT2020 #ATnobo2020 #ATFlipFlop2020 #ATsobo2020 #appalachiantrail2020 #appalachianlife #ATclassof2020 #StillOnTheAT #trektheat #thetrek #withguthook #hikemoreworryless #optoutside #wekeepyououtdoors #hikertrash #thruhike #hikerlife #getlost #backpacking #hikerlife #outdoorlife #hiking #adventure #wanderlust

We summited Mount Katahdin! We have hiked 1,212 miles of the Appalachian Trail so this was about our halfway point. I have learned so much in these 1,200 miles. When you hike day in and day out, you reflect on a lot. I‚Äôm a lot stronger than I thought I was. I‚Äôm not the weakling that some people (and myself) think I am. The trail will test you and it‚Äôs up to you to decide how to handle it.

It was a beautiful day for weather and just enjoying the first day in the park. We got to hike with our friend Michigan Millie! We met her back at Shaw‚Äôs back in September. She‚Äôs also a flip flopper and had just flipped back down and we got to enjoy hanging with her for the day and evening. We met a guy named Tarzan and he gave us a soda and some oranges and we chatted and hiked the next few miles together to a view point. Overall it was a great first day in the National Park! <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #AT2020 #ATnobo2020 #ATFlipFlop2020 #ATsobo2020 #appalachiantrail2020 #appalachianlife #ATclassof2020 #StillOnTheAT #trektheat #thetrek #withguthook #hikemoreworryless #optoutside #wekeepyououtdoors #hikertrash #thruhike #hikerlife #getlost #backpacking #hikerlife #outdoorlife #hiking #adventure #wanderlust

We have entered into the final state of this thru-hike! Virginia is about 1/4 of the whole AT! Thankful for this whole amazing opportunity to hike this amazing trail. I‚Äôm so happy we‚Äôve made it this far! Before we left West Virginia, we stopped by the ATC HQ and took our pictures. SUCKS we couldn‚Äôt get our Polaroid for the 2020 book (damn ATC) but oh well. We took our own photos and that‚Äôs good enough. We saw lots of stick bugs today and started the Virginia Roller Coaster section (14 miles of steep climbs and descents). We stopped about 5 miles in at a hostel that was allowing camping but turns out the first group there is able to stay in the hostel! So we did that and got a sweet deal of a bed, pizza, ice cream, soda and laundry! It was so worth it as it dropped into the 30‚Äôs that night! I also got the best night sleep I‚Äôve had in a while. I probably slept 12 hours. I must have really needed it! Day 1 of Virginia was not so bad after all. <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #AT2020 #ATnobo2020 #ATFlipFlop2020 #ATsobo2020 #appalachiantrail2020 #appalachianlife #ATclassof2020 #StillOnTheAT #trektheat #thetrek #withguthook #hikemoreworryless #optoutside #wekeepyououtdoors #hikertrash #thruhike #hikerlife #getlost #backpacking #hikerlife #outdoorlife #hiking #adventure #wanderlust

State number 12 completed! For some reason nobody has put a state border sign here.. which makes me kinda sad but oh well. We all know that when you cross the Potomac on the footbridge, you‚Äôve completed another state. Also here‚Äôs a photo of me in a tree right before crossing the border. It‚Äôs been a while since I have been able to get a photo like this cause all the trees are usually too small or have already fallen over.

There just seemed to be a lot of beautiful and amazing things to document. <br>It was a long day and once again super cold/windy day but we powered through. At least the sun was out otherwise it probably would have been miserable. It was hard to stop and take breaks because we would cool down to much and then it would take forever to warm back up. So we didn‚Äôt stop much except to eat lunch or the one time today to sit at a shelter for a snack break because it was right on trail. Seems like the shelters in this area are .2 or more off and it‚Äôs not worth it for just a snack break, a log or rock on the side of the trail will do just fine. üòÇ<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #AT2020 #ATnobo2020 #appalachiantrail2020 #appalachianlife #ATclassof2020 #StillOnTheAT #trektheat #thetrek #withguthook #hikemoreworryless #optoutside #wekeepyououtdoors #hikertrash #thruhike #hikerlife #getlost #backpacking #hikerlife #outdoorlife #hiking #adventure #wanderlust

Great way to start the day! The day did not go quite as planned as a storm rolled in. Luckily we were already stopped at a shelter for a snack break but we had to wait about 2 hours for the rain to stop. I‚Äôm trying to be extra careful since I can‚Äôt seem to stay warm&dry in the rain while it‚Äôs cold out. So if I have to hide in a shelter and miss miles because of it; so be it. It gave me a chance to browse through the shelter logbook which I try and do at every shelter if I have time (but I always make sure to sign them). Once the rain let up, we powered through the rest of the day and made it to a shelter right at sunset which is now around 5pm. It was extremely windy so I was afraid of setting my tent up and it crashing on me so I stayed in the shelter. I rigged my rain fly to help block the wind and it was instantly warmer in the shelter. Stayed warm most of the night so it was worth it! <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #AT2020 #ATnobo2020 #appalachiantrail2020 #appalachianlife #ATclassof2020 #StillOnTheAT #trektheat #thetrek #withguthook #hikemoreworryless #optoutside #wekeepyououtdoors #hikertrash #thruhike #hikerlife #getlost #backpacking #hikerlife #outdoorlife #hiking #adventure #wanderlust

I saw that blaze and it just made my day. Can‚Äôt really celebrate Halloween properly on trail but this was just enough I guess. Didn‚Äôt take many pictures. Was just enjoying the trail too much I guess. Also I was sitting on a lovely giant rock and felt the urge to take a selfie.

Plastic bags on the hands and feet! And it worked! It rained for about an hour and a half and I stayed dry! Just a little condensation from the body heat but wasn‚Äôt bad! We also found the halfway point for 2020! Although we are way over our halfway point, it was still cool to see and sign the post. We made it 20 miles and went to a burger place before the hostel and I finally finished my whole meal! I still don‚Äôt have hiker hunger! Stayed in a hostel again because we needed to go to Walmart and do a full resupply because we were running so low on everything. Sometimes gas stations just don‚Äôt have what you need..

I woke up refreshed even though I only got a little sleep but I was ready to attack the day. Today was the day when we got to hike up Blood Mountain. I‚Äôve hiked it multiple times as a day hiker but never with any real weight on my back. The ascent of Blood seemed to never end. All I could think about while climbing was the views up top and a place to sit down.<br><br>After we summited Blood, we had a little snack & lunch and headed down. I started not liking descents on this day, mostly because blisters were forming and I could feel every step. Another cool thing about Blood Mountain is that at the bottom of the mountain, the trail goes straight through an outfitter. While we were there, we relaxed a little and took care of some other things.<br><br>From Neel Gap, the campsite was only 2 miles away but the sun was starting to go down so we had to push it to get there with time to setup. This was probably the best campsite all trip because we didn‚Äôt have any rain and we didn‚Äôt sleep in the clouds so all our gear could dry out. Little did I know what was ahead of me after this day.

Tree and I started hiking the Appalachian Trail at the same time. In fact, her starting number is 1 lower than mine. She got off trail during the pandemic and understandably so. But the time she was on trail, we hiked and camped together, and quickly bonded. After she got off trail we kept in touch and texted from time to time. It was great seeing her and sharing stories of the trail. She'll be back out to finish her thruhike in 2021. So if you see her, look out for her. She's a very special, very hip lady.

We knew we wanted to make up miles because of the short day the first day. So we planned to do 10-13 that day. I knew some of the vistas we would be seeing because I‚Äôve been there before on day hikes. The sunset was magical at the end of the day and we literally slept in the clouds that night. Sleeping in the clouds sounds fun until you realize all the condensation from the clouds is making everything wet. All in all, day 2 was a great day.

I completed a marathon on the second half of the 100 mile wilderness. The first 40 miles of the wilderness have some good climbs but the rest of it is fairly flat. I knocked out the first 50 miles in 3 days. On the 4th day I pulled 26.3 miles. I started at 5:30 am and hiked until 6 pm. I didn't see another nobo all day and saw only a few sobos pass me, so it was nice and quiet. The weather was sunny but cooler so I didn't sweat much. Before that day, my biggest day was 21.6 miles. I was never much into big mile days but I like a good challenge. A marathon was one of my last goals before finishing the trail. The end of the 100 mile wilderness was the perfect place for it. I ended up finishing the 100 mile wilderness a little earlier than I wanted at 5 and a half days.

I discovered I couldn‚Äôt bend my leg - attempting to do so hurt quite a lot - and my knee was somewhat swollen. <br><br>The situation was worrisome bc I couldn‚Äôt remember injuring my leg during the previous day. The pain was, however, centered around the area where I had tweaked my quad coming down from Mt. Washington (DAY 189). <br><br>But bc I hadn‚Äôt bonked it, I was worried I might have a blood clot, a very dire possibility. And as luck would have it, I was alone at the shelter area, and also without a phone signal. I was completely on my own. <br><br>So it was a very long night. I could t sleep, so I watched 3 videos I had downloaded to my phone. <br><br>I determined that the best course of action in the morning would be to hike 3.7 miles back to Route 17 and flag a motorist to take me to get medical care. If, that is, I could stand up. <br><br>When morning came I found my leg was no better, and no worse, and that I could stand and shoulder my pack. I began hiking back to 17, very slowly. <br><br>Luckily, after only about a half a mile, I met another hiker, a retired man not too much older than me. I explained I might have a serious condition and he instantly agreed to hike with me and then take me to the nearest medical facility. <br><br>I was so relieved to have met another human being so quickly. It turns out my new companion had thru-hiked the AT in 2014. His trail name was Raven. We swapped stories about the many points of interest along the 1963 miles I had covered; Raven talked about the injuries he had experienced. Everyone on the trail has had many bumps and bruises. <br><br>Raven took me to the ER at Franklin Memorial Hospital in Farmington, 45 minutes away. An ultrasound ruled out the worst - no clots in my leg. The diagnosis was a torn muscle with some internal bleeding. I would need time to heal. The completion of my thru hike was very much in doubt. <br><br>My son drove up from Portland to meet me. It was so good to see him after my lonely night in the woods. #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atclassof2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #maine

I went up over Bemis Mountain in the morning, which was beautiful and covered with thick lush stands of young pines. As I walked along I could see Rangeley Lake to the north, surrounded by ever more colorful foliage. <br><br>By mid afternoon I crossed Maine Route 17 and headed toward Sabbath Day Pond, my destination for the day. I guessed it must be a popular spot, bc though I hadn‚Äôt seen anyone today up to that point, I now passed 7 day hikers heading back from the pond. <br><br>I made it to the Sabbath Day Pond Shelter by late afternoon and had my dinner.

He told me what I could expect up the Trail, and said I should tell a man named Poet, at Shaw‚Äôs hostel in Monson, that he had saved his life. This was bc Poet had advised him to switch from a fold up z-rest ground pad to a thermarest air mattress. The air mattresses have just enough insulating R-value to keep you warm. With the cold nights we‚Äôd had the last two days, Snapshot said he wouldn‚Äôt have survived on the z-rest. I thought this was a bit of an exaggeration, but I knew he was definitely better off on the air mattress. I promised to pass along his thanks to Poet. <br><br>I hiked steeply up, and then down, Moody Mountain, and then began a long climb up Old Blue Mountain. I finally made it up in the dusky late afternoon, and a brisk breeze was blowing through the thick and scrubby pines. <br><br>About a mile and a half down the other side of Old Blue I came to a trickle of a stream. My guide and other hikers had said a better water source, and stealth campsites, were another mile down the trail, but it was starting to get dark so I needed to make camp sooner. I watered up and then found a perfect campsite right next to the Trail just a tenth of a mile further. I pitched my tent and made dinner as the first stars shone through the evening sky. #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atclassof2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020 #backpackerlife #backpacker #maine

Like Old Speck, I had done this hike a few times, most recently w my son, Harry. <br><br>It was a sunny day, but cold and windy, and I put on my mid-layer and my windbreaker over that. The going up the peak dome of Bald Pate was bare and exposed (hence its name, I suppose) and it made for an exhilarating climb. Once again I could see the White Mountains, receding ever farther, and the foliage was starting to brighten up with reds and golds. Breathtaking view. <br><br>Originally, I planned to hike to the Frye Notch lean-to. But it was only 6 miles from Grafton Notch and I reached it by midday, and seeing how cold the days were becoming I decided I needed to get farther along towards Katahdin ASAP. <br><br>I had lunch, chatting w a couple of days hikers, then continued on for another 4.5 miles until I found a fantastic campsite near a small brook, w a burbling waterfall that washed into a deep pool (too cold for swimming now!). I pitched my tent, ate my dinner on a stone on the creek, and fell asleep to the sounds of the waterfall.  #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atclassof2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020 #backpackerlife #backpacker #maine

You swing around rocks, climb up and down them, and in a couple of places you squeeze through them, tunneling your way along. It takes a couple hours to get through this stretch; it‚Äôs a lot of fun rock scrambling. Luckily, the rocks were dry and not slippery. <br><br>After making it through, I had lunch by a stream, and once rejuvenated I climbed the very steep Mahoosuc Arm. Then, over to Old Speck, the third highest peak in Maine. On the way up, a bald rock face offered spectacular views to the west, including the Presidentials, which were now receding in the distance. Hard to believe I had been among them just a few short days ago. <br><br>Being a Mainer, I had climbed Old Speck several times w my family, and the trail was familiar to me. My stomping grounds. It was a little emotional to pass by landmarks I recognized. <br><br>The trail on Old Speck looks as though someone dumped a pile of concrete on it; it‚Äôs very rocky and was hard on my feet. Eventually, I made it down the three miles that led to the parking lot at Grafton Notch. In only about 60 seconds my ride appeared to take me to a hostel in Bethel where I‚Äôd resupply, get a Butcher Burger, and take a hot shower.  #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atclassof2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020 #backpackerlife #backpacker #maine

On September 22nd, Day 199 of my NOBO journey, my AT thru hike came to an end just 230 miles short of my goal. <br><br>I was camped at Sabbath Day Pond (mile 1963) when I awoke in the middle of the night not being able to bend my left knee. Long story short, after two precautionary trips to the ER  over the following week my doctors have determined there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôll be able to recover in time to complete my hike this year.  I have a torn muscle in my left leg that has led to a massive hematoma in my thigh; after a week and a half of rest I am still unable to bend my leg. <br><br>Naturally having to stop after hiking 90% of the Trail is very frustrating. It‚Äôs like building 9/10ths of a bridge and then quitting while looking down at the opposite shore. <br><br>On the other hand, I think I‚Äôve learned all of the life lessons the Trail imparts to any other thru hiker. Among those lessons:<br><br>* It doesn‚Äôt matter how you feel about the mountain. It‚Äôs there, so you can either hike over it, or go home. <br><br>* People are basically good. Pay their kindness forward.<br><br>* The Trail will provide.<br><br>I will only miss out on the exhilaration of climbing Mt. Katahdin. But I live in Maine, and I‚Äôve summitted Katahdin before, and walked the ridges of the Bigelows as well, so except for the Hundred Mile Wilderness I‚Äôve hiked nearly all of the Trail.  In time, I hope to return and finish what I started. <br><br>I thank my fellow hikers for their good company and spirit, and for the many others who supported us along the way in this incredibly challenging yet fascinating year. You will not be forgotten!

I had mentioned my plans of hiking it when we first started dating. I knew it was a lot to ask but she supported me. So I proposed on Stony Man Mountain, a nice little blue blaze in Shenandoah, last December.<br><br>I wanted her to be there with me when I summited Katahdin. Her experience hiking is minimal and Katahdin isn't an easy climb. We tried summiting on the 23rd. We made it to just above tree line when very high winds almost blew us off the mountain. I called the hike off as it was dangerous and I didn't walk for almost 7 months to have a windy, crappy summit day.<br><br>I didn't expect her to try climbing Katahdin a second time after the first experience. And wouldn't have asked it of her. But she thought it over and decided to give it a shot. We summited 3 days later on the 26th to plentiful sunshine and low winds. A perfect day! I'm so proud of you babe and can't wait to elope!

We summited Mount Katahdin! We have hiked 1,212 miles of the Appalachian Trail so this was about our halfway point. I have learned so much in these 1,200 miles. When you hike day in and day out, you reflect on a lot. I‚Äôm a lot stronger than I thought I was. I‚Äôm not the weakling that some people (and myself) think I am. The trail will test you and it‚Äôs up to you to decide how to handle it.

Lady Poles is an AT class of ‚Äò19er who decided to help out hikers at the beginning of this hiking season.

During the summer, in Pennsylvania, a mountain lion stalked me as I was drifting off to sleep. I managed to come out of the encounter unscathed and picked up an 18" Brazilian Tramontina machete 2 days later. I also picked up 2 grinding stones to keep the blade sharp. I would have much rather skipped the encounter so I didn't have to carry the extra 2 to 3 pounds so far. But sleeping wasn't easy after an experience like that. Until I got my big ass blade, of course.<br><br>A silver lining from carrying the machete is I would do 1 to 3 clearings a day of small to mid sized trees that would blow over onto the trail. There weren't as many trail maintainers on the AT this year due to the pandemic so there was a lot to do. I carried that thing this far so I had to get some pics with it on the summit of Katahdin. I'd like to thank Jake on the summit, who hooked me up with the polaroid in the second pic.

It took a few days, but the fact that it‚Äôs over has truly sunk in now, and I miss everything about the trail so, so much. I‚Äôm trying my hardest to be who I was on trail out here in the ‚Äúreal‚Äù world, but I have to admit that it‚Äôs hard. I‚Äôm still processing what this journey meant to me and how I can keep it going. I have thousands of photos to sift through, and I am excited to share them once I have them pared down a touch.

Anyways, we had quite the big group at Shaw‚Äôs and we spent the night signing around the fire and of course drinking some adult beverages.

That‚Äôs the wonderful thing about nature. Just being present. We crossed over the Kennebec River which is done by a canoe due to the rapid changing river. It is the official route of the AT because of this. Once across we did minimal climbing but still saw some great stuff and views. Our hiking partner was behind us so we left a message letting him know how far ahead we were. Of course @kenbo35 had to make it with the plentiful moose poop along the trail. üòÇ The trees are starting to turn colors and it‚Äôs so much better in person.

I had a big stack drenched in maple syrup along with blueberries, strawberries, orange juice and plenty of coffee. <br><br>I tanked up bc today was doing a 21 mile slackpack over the Wildcats. The trail would lead me from Pinkham Notch right back to the hostel. Lots of hikers elect to slackpack bc Wildcat is extremely steep. <br><br>Jay shuttled me To the Notch at 7:30 and off I went. About 6 miles into my day my quad started acting up and again my pace slowed considerably. But I just kept putting one foot in front of the other. <br><br>Finally, at 9:45pm, after 14:15 of hiking - the last 90 minutes of which I walked in the dark, illuminated by my headlamp (lesson learned on DAY 185) - I made it back to the hostel.

It was beautiful!<br><br>I hiked up Mt. Eisenhower just in time to see a squad from the NH National Guard take their oath right at the peak. Quite apropos. We thanked them for the service they would provide. <br><br>I reached the Lake of the Clouds Hut, and found it swarming w day hikers on this picture perfect day. The same was true on Mt. Washington. No wind. I was very lucky for this weather. <br><br>The rest of the day was more challenging, and somber. I tweaked my left quad coming down over the rocks and that slowed my pace considerably. <br><br>Then, as I passed Mt. Jefferson, I noticed a Blackhawk helicopter swoop in and hover over the peak. <br><br>‚ÄúI guess that‚Äôs today‚Äôs broken ankle up there,‚Äù I joked to some hikers coming towards me. <br><br>‚ÄúNo. Someone died up there,‚Äù replied one. <br><br>How sad. The helicopter continued to hover for almost an hour, ominously, as I slowly hiked by. <br><br>Finally, at dusk, I reached the Madison Spring Hut. It wasn‚Äôt supposed to be my final destination, but w waning light and aching legs I called it a day. The water spigot was working, and there were other hikers eating dinner so I joined them and pitched my tent on a flat knoll nearby. <br><br>#at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atclassof2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020 #backpackerlife #backpacker #newhampshire

The next day we woke up to some rain and stayed at camp until it passed around 9:30 before making our way up and over another mountain and super glad we waited because we got great views! <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #AT2020 #ATnobo2020 #appalachiantrail2020 #appalachianlife #ATclassof2020 #StillOnTheAT #trektheat #thetrek #withguthook #hikemoreworryless #optoutside #wekeepyououtdoors #hikertrash #thruhike #hikerlife #getlost #backpacking #hikerlife #outdoorlife #hiking #adventure #wanderlust

The way down looked very steep and in the last few days I‚Äôd learned that steep descents were slow-going for me, and it was 2.6 miles to the trailhead. <br><br>Thankfully, it hadn‚Äôt rained during the night as it had threatened. But it was raw. I decided to put on my running tights under my shorts, the first time I‚Äôd worn them since Georgia. <br><br>The Trail wasn‚Äôt as steep as I‚Äôd feared and I cruised along. On the way down I met Copper, a SOBO. He said he had passed Tarzan and the NOBO bubble yesterday. As we chatted, another SOBO, Hopper, caught up w us. Both confirmed that there was good weather in the offing for my traverse of Mt. Washington and the Presidentials tomorrow. #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atclassof2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020 #backpackerlife #backpacker #newhampshire

It was closed, and the handle from the water spigot had been removed. <br><br>So no water was had before another steep climb up South Twin mountain. Once up on this ridge it was a relatively easy hike compared to the last several days. <br><br>Around 3pm I reached the Zealand Hut, and it was open! I ate bowl of delicious lentil soup, along with a ‚Äúsunshine cake‚Äù and iced tea, as I sat on the deck and observed the majesty of the Whites. <br><br>Then, more than 4 miles of flat hiking, <br>much of it on planks through swamp and by Thoreau Falls. Finally, I came to Ethan Pond, a beautiful spot to end the day. Storm clouds were gathering, however, and the forecast called for thunderstorms. #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atclassof2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020 #whitemountains #backpackerlife #backpacker #newhampshire

As such crossed a bridge I met... Lemonade, who was just rolling up his ground tarp. He had slept right on the bridge! After telling  me the stealth campsites were too far away, he decided. He had hung his food bag on a branch right over the bridge. <br><br>We walked up the very steep stretch of trail - 2500‚Äô of elevation gain over 2.5 miles - to the Liberty Springs Campsite. On the way I learned my new friend had hiked the AT in 2019, and had suffered an ACL *and* MCL year while hiking Mt. Moosilauke. He also had a bad back and shoulder. <br><br>‚ÄúI‚Äôve learned to deal with pain,‚Äù he said. <br><br>No doubt. <br><br>Before too much longer I was on Little Haystack Mountain and above the tree line. The panoramic view was spectacular! It was a picture perfect late summer day, and I could see Mt. Lincoln, my next challenge, so close I could touch it. And faintly, off in the distance, the Presidentials. <br><br>Mt. Lincoln concealed the even taller Mt. Lafayette beyond it. I got to top of the latter not long after midday. I had my lunch, then observed a couple exchanging vows right then and there!  They picked a beautiful day for it. <br><br>Then it was a very long, slow, steep climb down Lafayette, then up Mt. Garfield, then halfway down the other side, to the Garfield Ridge Campsite. I had drunk all my water and was completely parched. I was relieved when I got to the campsite. I filtered water from the steam and immediately guzzled 3 liters before filling my water bottles. <br><br>All the tent platforms were occupied by the time I arrived, and a couple who had pitched on one of the ‚Äúlarge group‚Äù tent platforms kindly agreed to share. #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atclassof2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020 #whitemountains #backpackerlife #backpacker #newhampshire

Today I slackpacked north. At 16 miles it would be my longest day since getting back on the trail. Because of that, I thought about taking my headlamp, but decided against it, thinking it couldn‚Äôt take 12 hours to do it. Turns out I was wrong. <br><br>The hike up South Kinsman Mountain was one of the longest, steepest, and rockiest of my entire hike. Near the top, the mountain ate my trekking pole. I got to the peak and had lunch, wondering how I would manage w just one pole. Just then, two other lady hikers went by - each using one pole!<br><br>I texted Marleen and asked her to pick up a couple of poles and bring them to me along w my pack at the end of the day. I‚Äôd reimburse her, of course.<br><br>The day got later and later. Around dusk, I came by the Lonesome Lake Hut, the first AMC hut I‚Äôd passed. It was closed for the season, but its water spigot was still working, so I tanked up on potable water. <br><br>I continued down in the twilight. I hoped to let my eyes adjust and walk in the dark. I could use my phone, but it only had 20% power left, so I didn‚Äôt want to use it. I texted Marleen and let her know I‚Äôd be getting to the trailhead later than expected, and after dark. <br><br>My phone power dwindled to 1%. I had no phone signal and so I couldn‚Äôt tell Marleen exactly where I was. <br><br>Suddenly in front of me I saw...a headlamp! Miraculously, another hiker was starting out on the Trail! <br><br>The Trail Will Provide. <br><br>He introduced himself as Lemonade. He was middle-aged, but stocky and strong. He kindly walked me the half mile back to the trailhead, where a very worried Marleen was waiting. <br><br>I thanked Lemonade profusely. <br><br>‚ÄúMaybe I‚Äôll see you on the Trail tomorrow,‚Äù he said, and headed back into the darkness. <br><br>My plan was to pitch my tent near the trailhead, but Marleen convinced me that one more night at the Notch Hostel would be a better idea. I agreed. <br><br>The Trail will provide, but always bring your headlamp.  #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atclassof2020 #atnobo2020

The 12 mile portion of the #appalachiantrail up on the ridge line is gorgeous and fun to hike - I bagged two additional 4K peaks while I was up there: Jefferson and Adams. I‚Äôve enjoyed the last few nights at the Barn Hostel here in Gorham, NH and I‚Äôm currently taking a zero to wait out the rain.

I got to the town of Monson where everyone resupplies before the 100 mile wilderness and trail angle Odie was there with his bus taking people to Shaw‚Äôs hostel. My plan for the day quickly changed upon coming out of the woods. I laid around and ate food all day long instead of making my first chunk out of the wilderness section. By the way the cellular service is not good in there so you might be getting your daily updates a few days late. #jessallthingsrunning #appalachiantrail2020  #thruhike #hikelikeagirl #ATclassof2020 #appalachiantrailclassof2020 #athikethru #nobo #ATnobo2020 #whiteblaze #georgiatomaine #trektheat

I completed my NOBO thruhike of the Appalachian trail. All 2193 miles +8.8 mile approach trail. It took me 120 days in total to complete the trail. I saw 16 bears, 8 wild boar, 1 moose, 1 porcupine, 1 peacock, countless deer, rabbit and other wild creatures along the way. I met amazing people both on trail and in trail towns. Thank you to all the trail angels who helped us in town. Thank you to all the people along the way giving out trail magic; to us thru hikers it really boosts our spirits! Thank you to all my fellow hikers that I had the opportunity to hike with. And thank you to my support group at home who continually reminded me that I could do it. The trail is just a trail. It‚Äôs the people that make it special. #atnobo2020 #atthruhike2020 #appalachiantrail #hikershike #thruhike

There are only 2 more towns on the trail before the end so I think I will go into each of them to check them out. I stayed at the Sterling Inn last night and it was perfect because it had a store to resupply right inside the inn. #jessallthingsrunning #appalachiantrail2020  #thruhike #hikelikeagirl #ATclassof2020 #appalachiantrailclassof2020 #athikethru #nobo #ATnobo2020 #whiteblaze #georgiatomaine #trektheat

It was raining when I woke up so I decided to zip my tent and lay back down.  I got up leisurely and walked to the nearest town to do a resupply on my food items. I could have gone back out in the rain but there was a hostel .7 miles from the store and that was looking way better than the wet trail at the moment. It was time to celebrate 2,000 miles anyway! #jessallthingsrunning #appalachiantrail2020  #thruhike #hikelikeagirl #ATclassof2020 #appalachiantrailclassof2020 #athikethru #nobo #ATnobo2020 #whiteblaze #georgiatomaine #trektheat

I finished the day exactly 225 miles from the grand finale (Katahdin summit). Maine is a very difficult trail in my opinion so far. I have bee on very technical stuff and still a lot of steep ups and downs. I stopped for the Sahara beautiful pond and had a fun banter with a lot of SOBOers wanting to ask a bunch of questions. It was a fun way to think of my travels and tell stories for the night. 225 more miles to victory. #jessallthingsrunning #appalachiantrail2020  #thruhike #hikelikeagirl #ATclassof2020 #appalachiantrailclassof2020 #athikethru #nobo #ATnobo2020 #whiteblaze #georgiatomaine #trektheat

We got to spend a third night with Djuna (the dog) and she is such a sweet girl. She loves tortillas so I gave her my last two.

Maine is like nothing we've hiked so far. Any elevation change is basically straight up (or down) a rock slide.  The 1st half of the 100 Mile was relatively easy; small elevation changes but every step landed on a root or rock. The 2nd half of the 100 Mile's intensity was amplified by adding some small mountains like White Cap, The Chairbacks (all 4) and Barren Mountain. <br><br>Maine has been the prettiest, but there is a toll that is paid for this beauty<br><br>#thruhiking #atnobo #appalachiantrail #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail2020 #hiking #backpacking #atclassof2020 #optoutside #thruhiker #rei #hiketheat #whiteblaze #outdoors #choosemountains #teamninja #georgiatomaine #milesafoote #mountaingoat

That was leaving Dalton, MA and we had a 7.4mi section to go before camping for the night in Cheshire, MA - and @hen.tucks__16 hiked it with me! I ended up studying at their Airbnb in North Adams, MA that night - but on Saturday morning, my dad and I hiked up Mt Greylock! After some more trail magic on the summit, we parted ways and I kept on going north with the trail family. Yesterday, we crossed into Vermont and reached the 1600 mile mark!

The 7th was a hard and long day. We did almost 18 miles. I‚Äòve been in my head mentally a lot so I decided to count stuff throughout the day. That day I chose to count the little orange creatures called Newts, and I saw 21 of them over the course of the day. It was the most I had ever seen! We got to camp late so we cooked and immediately went to bed. Luckily on the 8th we had a shorter day of 12 miles. We woke up and went and talked with the local trail angel Tom and learned a few things about the town. We continued on and got some good views throughout the day. My feet started to hurt early so I was thankful for the short day. We made it to Father Tom Campsite, where we met one of the local caretakers and she told us the history of the campsite. It was such a lovely story and thankful that Father Tom did so much for the hikers over the years and we now have our own spot in town when we need a place to camp. <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #AT2020 #ATnobo2020 #appalachiantrail2020 #appalachianlife #ATclassof2020 #StillOnTheAT #trektheat #thetrek #withguthook #hikemoreworryless #optoutside #wekeepyououtdoors #hikertrash #thruhike #hikerlife #getlost #backpacking #hikerlife #outdoorlife #hiking #adventure #wanderlust

I had a decision to make yesterday after waiting at the post office half the day. Should I forward my box when it comes in to Lincoln, NH or should I stay and take a zero (after my very short day yesterday) in Hanover? My cold weather gear is not here but I checked the weather and for the next 3 days it looks ok. I decided to get back on trail and have the post office forward my stuff to Lincoln? The big question I have for people that know the area is if my box doesn‚Äôt arrive in Lincoln on Monday do I forward it to Maine and pick it up when I finish and go without cold weather gear (chance it that I won‚Äôt need it) or wait in Lincoln before the major climbs happen?? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. #jessallthingsrunning #appalachiantrail2020  #thruhike #hikelikeagirl #ATclassof2020 #appalachiantrailclassof2020 #athikethru #nobo #ATnobo2020 #whiteblaze #georgiatomaine #coldweathergear #newhampshire #whitemountains

I really wanted to take a stroll in my new shoes so decided to get out before the worst of the storm. I have my cold weather stuff in the mail that will be in Handover on Friday, which is 45 miles away. I decided to take my off day today here in Killington instead of Handover to keep from being in the nasty weather today. My shoes felt great! #jessallthingsrunning #appalachiantrail2020 #appalachiantrail #thruhike #hikelikeagirl #atclassof2020 #appalachiantrailclassof2020 #allwomenalltrails #womenthathike #athikethru #nobo #atnobo2020 #whiteblaze #georgiatomaine #backpacking #optoutside #withguthook #hike #hiking #camping #trekking #trailrunning #outdooradventure #outdoors #naturelover #mountain #mountains #throughhike

Then started the climb back up into the mountains and got some gorgeous views. Not long after that it started to rain and we decided to try and pitch my tent and hide out the rain and eat some lunch. Of course, by the time we got my tent up, we were soaked and so was most of the tent. We managed to get it kinda dry with a towel we had and hid out for about an hour before the rain subsided and we continued on forgetting to eat our lunch. Oops. But a couple miles later, we got some wonderful trail magic from Pirate and Stormy! They had Powerade, oatmeal cream pies, snickers and ramen! I was short a dinner so I was so thankful for the ramen! After spending longer than we should have with them(but worth it), we hiked another 4 miles to camp and made it just in time before the next wave of storms hit and rained most of the night. Since my tent was still soaked, I hung it in the shelter to try and dry overnight and luckily it did! I just had to deal with the mice all night! üôÉBut over all, another great day on trail! <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #AT2020 #ATnobo2020 #appalachiantrail2020 #appalachianlife #ATclassof2020 #StillOnTheAT #trektheat #thetrek #withguthook #hikemoreworryless #optoutside #wekeepyououtdoors #hikertrash #thruhike #hikerlife #getlost #backpacking #hikerlife #outdoorlife #hiking #adventure #wanderlust

Only 2 of them let me take their photo. We had some climbs today and at the top of one, we got a wonderful view of a farm and a racetrack right next to it. So we stopped and my dad got to enjoy some racing while I enjoyed the farm. We also found some trail magic in the form of post cards! We got to write one to a special person and hope they actually get it! We ended the night at a campsite that was a little rooty and uneven but I managed to find a semi decent spot. Unfortunately my dad knocked over his dinner, but he managed to save some of it! Luckily he was able to supplement the missing dinner with some extra snacks. <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #AT2020 #ATnobo2020 #appalachiantrail2020 #appalachianlife #ATclassof2020 #StillOnTheAT #trektheat #thetrek #withguthook #hikemoreworryless #optoutside #wekeepyououtdoors #hikertrash #thruhike #hikerlife #getlost #backpacking #hikerlife #outdoorlife #hiking #adventure #wanderlust

I was extremely upset that someone would do that but whoever took it must have really needed it. We luckily were able to make it to the next source with the water we had filtered the night before. After that we had quite the adventure dealing with some steep downhills down rocks. The rocks are definitely hurting my knees but I‚Äôm stretching them and I know they‚Äôll get stronger as time goes on. We made camp at this beautiful spot that had a pavilion and swing. We were supposed to go a little further that day but decided the area was worth the less mileage and we‚Äôd make it up later, which we definitely did üòñ..<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #AT2020 #ATnobo2020 #appalachiantrail2020 #appalachianlife #ATclassof2020 #StillOnTheAT #trektheat #thetrek #withguthook #hikemoreworryless #optoutside #wekeepyououtdoors #hikertrash #thruhike #hikerlife #getlost #backpacking #hikerlife #outdoorlife #hiking #adventure #wanderlust

As you can see my shoe is literally on its last steps. My shoes are in Manchester Center which was 38 miles from me when I woke up, I thought I have done that mileage since I have been on the trail üôÑ after mile 19.30 I was sitting having a pity party in the shade when a woman came up and said hi. I told her my situation and asked if she was going to town? She was going the other way but took her shoes off her feet and said ‚ÄúI need new trail shoes, please take them!‚Äù After arguing with her that I couldn‚Äôt possibly take her shoes I walked away with her shoes which were a perfect fit. She saved my day. I did another 8.81 miles to put me in reach to get to the post office by 12:30pm on Saturday. I didn‚Äôt get a picture because my phone was dead but I am so appreciative of her- trail name was fine üç∑ wine (so cute) #jessallthingsrunning #appalachiantrail2020 #appalachiantrail #thruhike #hikelikeagirl #atclassof2020 #appalachiantrailclassof2020 #allwomenalltrails #womenthathike #athikethru #nobo #atnobo2020 #whiteblaze #georgiatomaine #backpacking #optoutside #withguthook #hike #hiking #camping #trekking #trailrunning #outdooradventure #outdoors #naturelover #mountain #mountains #throughhike #boostoxygen

We left Weary Feet Hostel and stop shortly after at Dismal Falls. We pressed on toward Pearisburg. There, Fenway decided to slack pack with some people we met at Angel's Rest. Goat and I pressed on toward Catawba with our full load out. Water was scarce over to next 40 miles, so we either went without or carried extra. Neither is the optimal solution. We crossed 700 miles on the trail to the Dragon's Tooth. Next we descended into Catawba and stayed at Four Pines Hostel. The hostel was our base of operations for the few days. We  day hiked (with our packs though) up and back from McAfee's Knob. <br><br>Due the fast approaching fall in New England area, we have decided to flip to Katahdin, the northern terminus of the trail, and begin hiking south. <br><br>#thruhiking #atnobo #appalachiantrail #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail2020 #hiking #backpacking #atclassof2020 #optoutside #thruhiker #rei #hiketheat #whiteblaze #outdoors #choosemountains #teamninja #georgiatomaine #milesafoote #mountaingoat #fenway

As you can see my shoe is literally on its last steps. My shoes are in Manchester Center which was 38 miles from me when I woke up, I thought I have done that mileage since I have been on the trail üôÑ after mile 19.30 I was sitting having a pity party in the shade when a woman came up and said hi. I told her my situation and asked if she was going to town? She was going the other way but took her shoes off her feet and said ‚ÄúI need new trail shoes, please take them!‚Äù After arguing with her that I couldn‚Äôt possibly take her shoes I walked away with her shoes which were a perfect fit. She saved my day. I did another 8.81 miles to put me in reach to get to the post office by 12:30pm on Saturday. I didn‚Äôt get a picture because my phone was dead but I am so appreciative of her- trail name was fine üç∑ wine (so cute) #jessallthingsrunning #appalachiantrail2020 #appalachiantrail #thruhike #hikelikeagirl #atclassof2020 #appalachiantrailclassof2020 #allwomenalltrails #womenthathike #athikethru #nobo #atnobo2020 #whiteblaze #georgiatomaine #backpacking #optoutside #withguthook #hike #hiking #camping #trekking #trailrunning #outdooradventure #outdoors #naturelover #mountain #mountains #throughhike #boostoxygen

I went into town and was told there is a great outfitter store about 30 miles down the road that will pick you up from the trail. I am planning to stop there tomorrow to see if they have any shoes I can wear for my 639 more miles to Katahdin. I stopped in Dalton and spent the night with a trail angel named Tom, amazing person. Today did a leisurely 21.01 miles and missed all the rain that was forecasted. The temperature was perfect today and barely any eye diving bugs. #jessallthingsrunning #appalachiantrail2020 #appalachiantrail #thruhike #hikelikeagirl #atclassof2020 #appalachiantrailclassof2020 #allwomenalltrails #womenthathike #athikethru #nobo #atnobo2020 #whiteblaze #georgiatomaine #backpacking #optoutside #withguthook #hike #hiking #camping #trekking #trailrunning #outdooradventure #outdoors #naturelover #mountain #mountains #throughhike #boostoxygen

First, the heat was difficult and mixed with the humidity made it torturous. Second, as you see I had a shoe blow out on my right shoe. My toes were in the dirt after coming off the hillside where the flow out was and I cut the inside of my right ankle on a rock when it happened. Duck tape did help to get me to town. Third, the freaking bugs! There are all type of bugs that get on my nerves on this trail but those small gnats that buzz in your ears and go dive bomber style right in your eyes really piss me off. I started wearing my phone on my head to deter them with noise, it semi worked but made it more hot to deal with and no water logging my head to cool me down. Needless to say after 10.54 after a very nice trail angel fed me at a parking lot by a lake and then a very long 18.41 miles I made it just outside of Lee Massachusetts and going to try and get some new shoes and stay out of the rain that is suppose to happen in the morning. I might take a full day off but have not decided- I think I deserve it after yesterday. I did sleep right next to a beautiful lake and swam before bed which lightened my mood a little. #jessallthingsrunning #appalachiantrail2020 #appalachiantrail #thruhike #hikelikeagirl #atclassof2020 #appalachiantrailclassof2020 #allwomenalltrails #womenthathike #athikethru #nobo #atnobo2020 #whiteblaze #georgiatomaine #backpacking #optoutside #withguthook #hike #hiking #camping #trekking #trailrunning #outdooradventure #outdoors #naturelover #mountain #mountains #throughhike

As I pulled my gear to the nearby shelter a man asked ‚ÄúAre you alright?‚Äù Dang, I thought. My sore foot is that obvious? I better get off the Trail and get some serious rest w my friends George + Siobhan. <br><br>The man, who was about my age, said his name was Marc, and he and his 2 sons were headed back to their car, parked at the nearest trailhead 2.1 miles back. He very graciously offered to drive me all the way back to G+S‚Äôs place. I slogged out of the woods like a sloth. <br><br>On the drive, Marc , who was from Alabama, explained that their vacation in Vermont was ‚Äúplan 4.3‚Äù, due to COVID.  Originally, he said they planned to hike in New Mexico. Then the virus came along and put the kabosh on that. He then looked at booking a trip to the Wonderland Trail around Mt. Ranier, but it was too late to book a registration. He decided to plan a trip to the Adirondacks, and booked a flight to Albany. Just before they were to leave, a 14-day quarantine was declared for people coming to NY, so a trip pond-hopping in the Green Mountains was their fallback. <br><br>Siobhan took me to the local clinic where I got some unfortunate - but not unexpected - news. I had a stress fracture in my foot. The recommended treatment? 3-8 weeks of rest. I‚Äôm already reading up on nutrition plans to promote healing of bones. <br><br>Looks like I‚Äôll have to take a break for awhile, but there may still be time for me to finish my trek before Katahdin closes for the winter.

Breakfast and a pleasant hike along the pond. Cool morning air. A spectacular view from the top of rocky Baker Peak. Gradually though, my sore right foot began to throb, and my pace slowed to well under 2 mph. <br><br>After hiking for 3 1/2 hours, I came to Big Branch, a good sized flowing stream only 5.8 miles from my point of origin. I decided to cross the large suspension bridge and take a break in the opposite bank. As I did so, I felt a prick in my left leg. ‚ÄúStupid mosquito!‚Äù I thought. I went to swat away the pest, but when I looked down I saw a yellow jacket hanging off my leg by its stinger!  It didn‚Äôt hurt too badly, but it‚Äôs funny how much more it hurt when I suddenly knew it wasn‚Äôt a mosquito. <br><br>I fetched water in Big Branch, took my shoes off, and soaked my aching foot in the cold flow. I had an early lunch and my leg felt much better. <br><br>But it didn‚Äôt last long. The soreness returned as soon as I hit the trail again. I decided the best thing to do would be to cut today‚Äôs hike short and rest up at Little Rock Pond. I could soak my leg in the pond and maybe go for a swim. <br><br>It was a slow slog to the pond but I finally made it. Since it was early in the day (1:30pm) I was able to get a choice tent platform. I set up my tent and took a nap, elevating my foot on my pack. I was starting to wonder if I had a stress fracture. Time will tell. Until tomorrow, ‚Äúrest is best‚Äù. #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atclassof2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020 #vermont #longtrail

Mid-morning George drove me to the outfitter in Manchester. On the way we noticed a hiker with his thumb out for a hitch and we picked him up. His name was Spring Break, and he had been hiking the AT over the last few years a section at a time. He said he was a teacher and took to the Trail for a month every summer. <br><br>George got me back to the Trail.  I thanked him for his hospitality and we said our goodbyes. I was looking forward to seeing him and Siobhan next week when I took a break at Beth‚Äôs family‚Äôs lake house in Maine. <br><br>I hit the Trail and hiked up Bromley Mountain, making reasonably good time. Towards the top, however, my right foot, which had been a little sore for a couple of days, began to throb. <br><br>Bromley has ski slopes, and I decided to take a break on the chair lift on the summit. I was soon joined by Casper, a SOBO thru hiker. Curious about the situation in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, I asked him about his experience. He said the AMC huts were closed but you could still get water there, and food, for a modest price. He said there were three main ‚Äúups‚Äù: Mt. Moosilauke, the ‚ÄúPressies‚Äù (Presidentials), and Wildcat Mountain. I felt a little better about the traverse, which could be the most challenging of my hike. <br><br>With my sore foot, I was glad I only had to hike 10 miles today. By 6pm<br>I got to beautiful Griffith Pond and got a great tent platform site fairly close to the shore. #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atclassof2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020 #vermont #longtrail

I aired out my tent, checked/cleaned my gear, tried on my fresh pair of replacement boots, and caught up on my zzzzzzz‚Äôs. <br><br>Beth left for her family‚Äôs lakeside cottage in Harrison, Maine.

George and his wife Siobhan live near Manchester, VT, and they had invited me to stay over in my way through. Siobhan is an old friend of my girlfriend Beth; the two ladies were driving up from New Jersey that morning to meet us in the afternoon. <br><br>George drove me to the local general store where we picked up sandwiches,and I of course got the requisite Gatorade. As I stood in the checkout line, someone poked me in the butt.

We made it 55 days into the adventure and 230.6 miles. West Virginia to New Jersey. It‚Äôs crazy to think that I walked that far, however that‚Äôs about 2,000 miles less than I hoped. We have unfortunately decided to hop off trail due to reoccurring injuries. I‚Äôm very bummed about this and still continue to get sad when I think about it. The decision feels like it came too quickly. If you‚Äôve been following along and remember, 10 days in I sprained both ankles and found out I had heel spurs. My ankles healed and for a while were doing very well. My legs were getting stronger, my cardio stronger, and my mental strength and optimism were honing in. Then after 6 really hard falls in one week they went to crap again. Took a few more days off, got back on and took another spill and felt my right ankle pop again. Took another couple days off and  went to urgent care because I was also experiencing a burning/Charlie horse sensation in the arches of my feet intermittently through out the day. Turns out I had another sprained ankle and plantar fasciitis in both feet. I‚Äôve had it before but never experienced it like that. Knowing that this was the reality, it was best to make a decision to get off. Even though I‚Äôm sad about this, I literally feel like I can take on anything challenging physically and mentally! I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs next in regards to the trail but at least I know it‚Äôs always there. I 100% want to finish it whether that be section hiking or attempting a thru again in the near future. I know what I need to work on and some gear changes I would do next time. Thank you for all the encouragement through this journey!! Here‚Äôs to more hikes and backpacking in the future! For now it‚Äôs relaxing and visiting friends before heading back home. Special thank you to the Hayworth‚Äôs for rescuing us when we needed it as well as the Taylor/Veccia clan for rescuing us too and letting us join in on family vacation in the Shenandoahs. :) Stay tuned for our last video of when we were on trail and some highlights!<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #appalachiantrail2020 #atthruhike #atnobo2020 #atflipflop #atflipflop2020

Today was my 100th day on the Appalachian Trail and we crossed into New Jersey!!! Byeee Rocksylvania! 7 out of 14 states down, 7 to go! We hiked the whole day with @kevingdwyer and had an incredible time putting in some miles together. To top it all off, his incredible parents hosted us afterwards for dinner and a chance to sleep in some AC. (Plus, I got to meet @milohamiltondwyer in person!) This whole day rocked, and it was the perfect way to cap 100 days of adventure. I love this trail and this community and everything about this journey ‚ù§Ô∏è #atclassof2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #delawarewatergap #thruhike

By dawn the rain had stopped; I got on the trail a little later than I‚Äôd liked, after a lackadaisical breakfast and a little socializing w the other hikers. By 8am I passed the Glastonbury Lookout Tower at the top of the mountain but it was shrouded in fog so not worth climbing to check out the view. After traveling most of the day, I came to the fire tower on Stratton Mountain, and it too was in the fog. No panoramic views of the Green Mountains for me today. <br><br>I descended to the Stratton Pond Shelter, one of the largest in the AT. Bc everything was damp from yesterday‚Äôs rain, I decided once again to stay in the shelter - 3 days in a row - which must have been a record for me. #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atclassof2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020 #vermont #longtrail

I made sure my hand sanitizer was at the ready and that my mask was on. <br><br>I was back at the trailhead well before noon and hiked through the Glastonbury Wilderness to the Goddard Shelter, near the peak of Glastonbury Mountain and the summit fire tower. Rain once again threatened, so I shared the shelter with several others, including Frodo, who was hiking the Long Trail SOBO w her dog Samwise, and several section hikers. They questioned me about proper attire for hiking in the rain. I told them I felt that in warm weather rain jackets might get too hot, and that you could be fine and warm in the rain as long as you kept moving. <br><br>#at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atclassof2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020 #vermont #longtrail

In the morning from Mt. Prospect Ledge I had a great view of cloud-shrouded valleys below. At midday, atop the next ridge, I entered my 12th state - Vermont, and the Trail shared its path with the Long Trail. Very shortly thereafter I passed the 1600 mile mark for the hike. Amazing how far I‚Äôve come!<br><br>The trail immediately seemed to be much better maintained by crews from the Green Mountain Club. <br><br>At the end of the day I came to the Congdon Shelter, where I met a 14-y.o. hiker named Weatherman who was a day away from completing a hike of the entire Long Trail (SOBO). He had been accompanied by chaperones on his trip and tonight his mum, Sweaty Betty, a long distance trail runner, was with him. I had an enjoyable conversation w them, and, bc rain was expected that night and bc the good tent sites were already occupied, I decided to take a bunk in the shelter. #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atclassof2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020 #vermont #longtrail

On the way I had a scare after taking a picture of the Hoose House; about a quarter mile later I realized my phone was not in my pocket! üò±üò±üò± I retraced my steps and found it in the grass outside the ‚ÄúHoose‚Äù. Fortunately I hadn‚Äôt had to go far. <br><br>By late morning I came to Diane‚Äôs Twist in Cheshire, where I got a delicious homemade meatball sandwich - and the namesake vanilla-chocolate twist. <br><br>Then the afternoon was spent ascending Mt. Greylock. Near the summit, a thunderstorm moved in, and I donned my rain jacket for the first time since Virginia bc I felt...cool, for the first time in weeks. The rain stopped just as I reached the War Memorial at the top. I had dinner (a sub I bought the night before) on a bench at the adjacent Bascom Lodge (closed - they‚Äôre closed on Tuesdays). Then it was down the hill to the Wilbur Clearing Shelter, where I found Boss, already wrapped like a mummy in her sleeping bag, and Captain, another thru hiker heading north.  #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atclassof2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020 #massachusetts

Then I took @erininthesky to the boardwalk section of the trail I completed the day before about 5-6 miles complete but not accounted for on my watch since it was completed yesterday. Then went to a great lunch before I said goodbye to Erin. I started at about 2pm and with the wonderful section of #stairwaytoheaven on a Saturday it was a madhouse of people on the trail. I got a really cool bonus for today after completing 14.86 miles, the drive in movie theater let‚Äôs thru hikers stay and camp and also watch movies completely free! I had such a fantastic night meeting more nobos yesterday and today than I have in a long while on the trail. #jessallthingsrunning #appalachiantrail2020 #appalachiantrail #thruhike #hikelikeagirl #atclassof2020 #appalachiantrailclassof2020 #allwomenalltrails #womenthathike #athikethru #nobo #atnobo2020 #whiteblaze #georgiatomaine #backpacking #optoutside #withguthook #hike #hiking #camping #trekking #trailrunning #outdooradventure #outdoors #naturelover #mountain #mountains #throughhike

Yet again, I couldn‚Äôt be happier. <br><br>The day wasn‚Äôt always like this. I lost my sandals at Max Patch today, which frustrated me to no end. We figured they fell off my pack while we stopped for pictures at a campsite, but when I ran back to fetch them, they were gone.<br><br>I was sour. I made self-deprecating jokes. I marched down the trail a breakneck speed practically stomping my feet. I wanted to be alone to work out my disappointment in myself, yet I stayed by Doc. We laid on a rock and stared up at the leaves and the sky while we elevated our feet, and I felt better.<br><br>Last night‚Äôs night sky was a sight to behold. After graciously receiving some beers from a buncha folks (Doc lovingly calling it redneck trail magic) at an air traffic control station, we wandered up the trail at Snowbird Peak to find a lush camping spot with an incredible view of blue and purple mountains that go on forever. The sky was clear and we had talked earlier that we‚Äôd be able to see stars, a rare sight in our green tunnel.<br><br>We stayed there, and watched a blood moon rise up from the horizon and peek out behind the clouds. It looked like a meteor aimed for Earth, it was so bright. Like fire. To the left and right were lightening storms about 100 miles away. After relentlessly researching and game-planning an emergency escape if the storms approached, we stayed and laid there identifying stars, watching the flashes of lightning in the sky and the moon creep higher above our heads. In the morning, we watched again as the sun rose above the flowers and grasses. <br><br>I hadn‚Äôt thought about this part when I envisioned this trip. The moon, the Arabian-night-like colors of the sky, the way the sun dips behind the turtle shell of a nearby mountain. The light practically pink. <br><br>I also didn‚Äôt think about who I would do these things with, and how great it is to have a partner, a buddy, a friend to enjoy these with. #athiker #atthruhike #atnobo2020 #atflipflop  #womenwhohike #freedom #sunset #sunrise #hiking #adventure #camping

Early in the day I passed over I-90; then I passed beaver ponds, pine stands, and a few rocky stretches. Boss and I kept passing each other all day whenever one of us  would stop to rest or eat. <br><br>I made such good time that I decided to push on into Dalton. The Trail goes right through town past the home of Tom Levardi, who generously allows thru hikers to camp in his yard. Tom has plenty of refreshments on hand for Boss and me: cold drinks, fresh fruit, and brownies made by his neighbor. <br><br>I pitched my tent and left the rain fly off, since it was such a nice evening. Then I walked a few blocks into town to the local sub shop - getting one for dinner and one to pack out for tomorrow, of course. On the way back, I got an ice cream cone, and then.... it started to drizzle, though there was no rain cloud above. I hurried back to Tom‚Äôs and found that he had thrown a tarp over my tent to keep it dry, but not before some rain had seeped in. The moral of this story: always put your fly up! ü§™ <br><br>I stopped up the dampness and let the tent air out while I wrote this on Tom‚Äôs front porch. #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atclassof2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020 #massachusetts

Someone had placed a dozen Sprites and Fantas in a roadside stream. I noticed it while fetching water; I helped myself. <br><br>Boss and I made it to the pond by 3pm and were quickly in the water. It felt luxurious! We let the air dry us. <br><br>I then made dinner at the nearby cabin. It was locked, but there was a picnic table on the deck, and enough room for Boss to set up her tent. After dinner I went to the bona fide tenting area, set myself up in one of the platforms, and crawled inside. I was immediately sound asleep; it was 6pm.  #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atclassof2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020 #massachusetts

Later, I was grateful he did. Joe explained that most years he puts 12 jugs out during July and checks them every day. During the year of the pandemic, however, only 8 were necessary and he checked them every third day. <br><br>I stopped for lunch at the Tom Leonard Shelter, which had a sculpture garden of fungi adorning a tree trunk nearby. <br><br>I then went by Benedict Pond, and The Ledges, which offered a view of Mt. Everett, over which I‚Äôd come on Thursday. <br><br>Later, at the S. Wilcox Shelter, I shared accommodations with a female college student named Boss, who was trying to get to Katahdin from Harper‚Äôs Ferry before going back to class in late August, and Little Feet. #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atclassof2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020 #massachusetts

I had a very slippery wet afternoon and decided to call it quits early. I was checking my messages here on Instagram and came across trail magic virtually, I was picked up by trail angels and taken to a beautiful dairy farm to dry out, sleep, shower and laundry.

I had to cross Stony creek today and the water was waist deep and I told myself I would be getting a hotel room to be able to sit in a bathtub after that disgusting water. It was a interesting experience to say the least! I was really nervous once it hit the waist because I didn‚Äôt want it to get to my pack. I had to jump up and over huge fallen trees at the deepest part as well. Thank goodness I didn‚Äôt fall! #jessallthingsrunning #appalachiantrail2020 #appalachiantrail #thruhike #hikelikeagirl #atclassof2020 #appalachiantrailclassof2020 #allwomenalltrails #womenthathike #athikethru #nobo #atnobo2020 #whiteblaze #georgiatomaine #backpacking #optoutside #withguthook #hike #hiking #camping #trekking #trailrunning #outdooradventure #outdoors #naturelover #mountain #mountains #throughhike #boostoxygen

I arranged to have a shuttle driver meet me at Rt. 7 near Great Barrington at 6pm to take me to the TravelLodge where I could shower and do laundry. My clothes and I were so sweaty and grungy I could barely stand it. I had my work cut out for me, bc there were 3 very steep, very rocky mountains to crest before making my destination. <br><br>I hiked up a Bear Mountain early just as the mist was beginning to lift. A beautiful sight. There was no sign but I was in my 11th state - Massachusetts!<br><br>I hiked down the other side and along Sage‚Äôs Ravine until I came to a large swimming hole Jedi had reminded me about. I stripped down to my shorts and waded in and under. Refreshing!<br><br>Since I had nothing to dry myself with except my damp camp towel, and bc my shirt was so grungy, I went shirtless the rest of the day, which was just as well bc it soon became a scorcher. <br><br>I hiked up mountain #2 - Mt. Race - which offered a stunning ledge walk w views to the south. Unfortunately I couldn‚Äôt take any pictures bc I needed to conserve power to check in a my ride later on. <br><br>There were ripe blueberries along the summit trail and I grabbed a few handfuls as I went along. Back down off Race, and then right back up Mt. Everett. The going was tough on the way back down, as it was steep and the path at times nonsensical. At the bottom, I cameled up at a stagnant stream: I filtered 2 liters, guzzled them down, and filtered 2 more. Water was tough to come by today on these mountains. <br><br>There was one more steep decline, and that‚Äôs where I met Socks, a very thirsty section hiker heading up. He asked about water, and I told him where I‚Äôd gotten mine, but he looked *really* thirsty. He said he had 6 oz., so I gave him half a liter of mine. <br><br>I cruised the rest of the way. Joe, my ride, was already there. He said he had just started shuttling hikers again on July 1st. He was shuttling one hiker a day; last year, he said he averaged more than 10/day in July. #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atclassof2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020 #at2020 #massachusetts

A bike path puts you right in the parking lot of LaBonne‚Äôs market, which is an excellent place to resupply. I got a couple peaches, 2 great deli sandwiches (packed one for dinner) and some California rolls for something a little different. Of course I got 3 Powerades, chugging 2 and packing one. <br><br>There was a little gravel stone plaza behind LaBonne‚Äôs that‚Äôs called Hiker Square, w outlets protruding from the ground that can be used to recharge your electronics. I spent a couple hours there doing just that and drying off from the morning humidity as the sun came out. <br><br>At around 4 I headed out of town for a 3 mile jaunt to the Riga Shelter area. When I got there I found that this shelter had one of the best views of any on the Trail, overlooking the Twin Lakes. I pitched my tent at one of the several well manicured sites, and hung my sweaty clothes on a makeshift clothesline. #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atclassof2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020 #connecticut

Today was so much fun because the terrain was easy, the weather was mild-er, and I had so many milestones to look forward to. It‚Äôs wild to think that from today forward, every step is now counting down to Katahdin, and not up to halfway anymore. Shortly after this sign, I also crossed the 1,100 mile mark. AND THEN I ate a half gallon of ice cream with my friends to celebrate. I did not feel good afterwards. But not so bad that I couldn‚Äôt eat two plates of spaghetti hours later üòÇ Looking forward to the second half of the AT and making more memories like today. #atnobo2020 #atclassof2020 #thruhike #halfgallonchallenge

Algo Shelter > Sharon Mountain Campsite (1489.6/+19.8) <br>I was on the Trail by 4am and made it to an overlook called Caleb‚Äôs Peak by daybreak. Soon I saw an outcrop called St. John‚Äôs Ledge which had a fantastic view of the Housatonic River far below as well as the ridge beyond. I stopped for breakfast and marveled at the beautiful sight. <br><br>Suddenly, the view got even more beautiful, when the ‚ÄúConnecticut Girls‚Äù, Susan and Laurie, happened by! üòâüòâüòâ Susan‚Äôs intrepid canine Finn wouldn‚Äôt sit still for a pic until I said the magic word - ‚Äúbacon!‚Äù He took notice (they always take notice). <br><br>Laurie told me she had a friend who was hiking three trails, the AT, the PCT, and the CDT, *simultaneously*! He‚Äôd do a stretch on one, then fly to another. Sounds a bit much for me. <br><br>Once I got down off these shelf-like ledges, S&L said I‚Äôd enjoy a hike along the Housatonic. They were right. It was one of my favorite hikes so far - pasture to one side, the river to the other, hiking under large trees on pine straw. <br><br>Climbing up again, at a road crossing I came to a lunch bag marked ‚ÄúTRAIL MAGIC‚Äù. Alas! There was nothing left inside. Surrounding the bag were rocked signed in sharpie by other hikers who thanked the trail angel for their treats. Sadly, I had nothing to add. <br><br>But The Trail Provides. Late in the afternoon I came to the Pine Swamp Brook Shelter, where I met a couple, Stormy and Pirate, along with Teacher. I told them how I missed out on the trail magic, and Stormy gave me her grape Powerade (she didn‚Äôt like the taste, she explained) and a Snickers bar. I didn‚Äôt need to sign a rock to thank them. Stormy and Pirate were section hiking for 10 days and planned to hike the entire Trail in 2022. We had a nice chat. <br><br>Then, after gathering some water, I headed 2.5 miles further to the Sharon Mountain Campsite (in CT, you can only camp at designated locations). There were mosquitoes, not an intolerable amount, but enough to have me inside my tent as soon as dinner was finished. #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atclassof2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020 #connecticut #connecticutgirls

Another state down... 6 out of 14! I struggled hard core today, between the exhaustion (turns out starting a 24 hour challenge after being awake since 9am is unwise), the heat, and some seriously sore feet and legs. We ended up taking a little 2.5 hour cat nap at 2:30am about 17 miles in, and I walked into Pen Mar Park right at 7pm - a touch behind schedule. It feels fantastic to have done my biggest day ever on trail at 41 miles, but I am going to be a mess tomorrow.

Algo Shelter (1469.8/+12.4) At daybreak I headed downhill, followed a road for a bit to a trailhead and into Connecticut! State #10 and back in New England! I soon crossed the Housatonic River, and after 5 miles I came to a covered bridge, Bulls Bridge, which led to a country store, where I promptly loaded up on 2nd breakfast: a hot ham egg and cheese sandwich, 2 cokes, blueberry muffin, ice cream sandwich, washed down w t obligatory 32 oz Gatorade. I got 2 pre-made deli sandwiches and voila! - I had lunch and dinner. <br><br>Today was a scorcher, so I also loaded up on 2 liters of water from the store spigot. I took it slow along the trail, stopping often to admire the view or to linger by a creek where I‚Äôd gather more water. <br><br>By 3:30pm I made it to the Mt. Algo Shelter area. It was a beautiful wooded clearing w plenty of good spots for tenting. I pitched and ate both my lunch and dinner sandwiches. <br><br>I was only a little over a mile from the town of Kent. I checked Yelp for local restaurants but - alas! - none were open, today being Monday. So I was content to rest, thinking I‚Äôd get up super early tomorrow to hike a bunch of miles before the heat of the day became too oppressive. #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atclassof2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020 #connecticut

To that end, I hit the trail at 4:45am and hiked through the cool and the dark. <br><br>I made breakfast at a rural railroad crossing a couple hours later, then passed by the inauspiciously named Nuclear Lake (it‚Äôs lovely, despite the name). <br><br>I reached W Dover Rd. and encountered the Dover Oak, the largest oak tree on the Trail. It‚Äôs about 6 feet in diameter. <br><br>I crossed route 22 by 11am and headed a half mile down the road to hiker-friendly Toni‚Äôs Deli. I got an Ultimate Cowboy Burger (2 quarter pound patties, cheese, onion, BBQ sauce) washed down w t usual 2x32 oz gatorades. I took a 2+ hour siesta in the shade while charging my phone. I made it back to the trailhead by 2pm. There was a steep climb back up the ridge past some pastures, but the terrain was OK once on top. My goal was to hike to CT, but after feeling a twinge in my knee and, not wanting to take any chances, I stopped a mile short at the Wiley Shelter, joining the same crew from the evening before. There were a couple of great tent platforms, so I set up shop at one. - #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atclassof2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020 #newyork #newyorkdeli

I got up about 5:30 and went up to the bath house area where I was able to get water from a drinking fountain. I fixed breakfast on one of several stone benches. I had the whole lake to myself so I decided to go for a swim and rinse off yesterday‚Äôs sweat and grunge. I then used the hot air hand dryer in the bathroom to attempt to dry off my clothes and pack towel, w only moderate success. <br><br>I soon came to the top of Shenandoah Mountain, where I met a young thru hiker whose trail name was Gray Man. There was a large American flag painted on the rocks there as a 9/11 memorial but it was apropos to see it on 7/4. <br><br>An hour later I reached the RPH Shelter, which appeared to have been built as part of an Eagle Scout‚Äôs project. There were more than a dozen water jugs inside, but all were empty. No matter - I cameled up using the water pump around the back. <br><br>By about 1:30 I reached my #1 goal for the day: the Mountaintop Deli, located about a half mile off the trail along Route 52. I went around the back to dry my tent and clothes and found that the NOBO thru hiking Pratt Brothers (not Frat Brothers as I‚Äôd thought the day before) were already there, sitting in some ramshackle folding chairs in the shade. We compared notes and I went inside to get lunch: an excellent roast beef sandwich which I washed down w 2 32 oz bottles of Gatorade and a watermelon pop sickle. <br><br>I told the Pratts that I was headed to the Morgan Stewart Shelter area, but that I‚Äôd wait out the sun a while before doing so to avoid hiking during the hottest part of the day. They said they‚Äôd be waiting for me when I got there and went on ahead. <br><br>I whiled away then afternoon and snoozed in the shade as all my gear became warm and dry. At 4, I ordered another roast beef sandwich for the road, packed up, and walked the final 4 miles to the Shelter. The Pratts were there, along w 2 young section hikers hammocking nearby.

We are (temporarily) off trail for a week. Over the 752 miles we completed, I developed Plantar Fasciitis in BOTH my feet. What started as a painful nuisance, turned into me hobbling into and out of camp and it became unbearable.<br><br>However, still determined to finish the trail, we have decided to ‚ÄòYellow Blaze‚Äô the remainder of the trail. We‚Äôll be car camping up from where we got off trail all the way to Katahdin. It‚Äôs not ideal or what I had wanted for so long, but I‚Äôm still thankful we are gonna be able to continue our adventure of the AT in some form and I‚Äôm super excited to get back out! These are the last photos from our last week on trail, including snakes, bears, views, and what remains of my trail runners. üòÖ<br><br>Thank you ALL who have supported me, reached out, asked questions, given encouragement, and have just enjoyed following us along the trail. It‚Äôs been more than I ever hoped for and I‚Äôm super thankful for everyone who reached out! I‚Äôm gonna continue to post the rest of our journey for you all, thank you and HIKE ON! <br><br>#appalachiantrail #atnobo2020 #at #at2020 #atthruhike #at2020thruhike #thruhike #pack #thrupack #gear #hiking #hikinggear #ultralight #ultralightbackpacking #backpacking #thruhiker #appalachianmountains #lighterpackclub

A cabbie got me back to the Appalachian Deli by 10am, where I picked up an Appalachian Delight sandwich for lunch. Immediately tweaked the left leg (slightly, nbd) but it slowed me down a bit. So did rocky up and down terrain most of the day. There was also a lot of blow-down in my path.<br><br>Whew! Got 14 miles in. Got to Canopus Lake, w/in a state park and w AT camping and a big sandy beach.  A family having a beach day fed me a pork chop, chicken leg, rice and sunny d-lite. I bumped into Hungry up at the bathhouse area; I also met two guys who called themselves The Frat Brothers. I was going to go for a swim but a giant thunderstorm was rolling in so needed to get my tent up ASAP. Jumped inside just as the floodgates opened.  #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atclassof2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020 #newyork #newyorkdeli

I got compression stockings since my lower left leg was now swelling every day, and I tried a low-budget knee brace for the right leg. After a couple of days I started walking around the reservoir in Central Park to work out the kinks. Just about everyone (joggers, cyclists, power walkers) was wearing masks. <br><br>Beth is starting a company called the Suck It Socket (suckitsocket.com) that makes a little doo-hickey that you can attach to your mask to let you suck down drinks w/o taking off your mask. We did a little product testing and market research by drinking margueritas at our favorite Upper West Side bodega, which had just reopened for outdoor seating. <br><br>It took forever, but I also got a replacement for my pack delivered to me (long story). By that time, Thursday, my legs were feeling a lot better and I was more than ready to get back out on the Trail. - #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atclassof2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020 #newyork #newyorkcity

Tuesday, 6/30, we started the Roller Coaster and crossed the 1,000 mile marker! (We aren‚Äôt super sure what the stones were spelling out) I cannot believe that I‚Äôve walked 1,000 miles since February 29th - 775 miles continuously since getting back on trail May 9 - this number seemed next to impossible to achieve down in GA. Then yesterday, Wednesday 7/1, I finished the Roller Coaster, LEFT VIRGINIA (WOO), and walked into Harpers Ferry WV with @wildonthetrail! For whatever reason, at the end of the day yesterday, I was absolutely wrecked - I was taking small, shuffling steps across the Shenandoah River bridge, but I was SO EXCITED to take photos in front of the ATC office. This marks the mental halfway point of the AT (the actual halfway point is a little further north in PA) and I am just in shock... and ready for a little break, as we are taking the rest of the week off for the 4th. These last two days have been incredible... I can‚Äôt wait to see what the next 1,168 miles hold. #atnobo2020 #atclassof2020 #atthruhike #thruhike #wv #harpersferry

Even though it was a great view and we will finally be out of PA tomorrow, today sucked bad. I fell two more times totaling in 6 times over the course of a week and a half and snapped a trekking pole! The last of which two men had to come help me up because I was about to roll down the hill. I am very much ready to be done with this state and be in a different one! It took a while to start feeling optimistic and to feel like my trail name again, Hopeful. With some food, a view, meeting other hikers, and lots of water at the shelter provided by a trail angel, my spirits are on the up and up. Pray I don‚Äôt fall anymore!<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachiantrail2020 #atflipflop #atflipflop2020 #atthruhike2020 #thruhike #hikertrash #backpacking #hiking #hikingadventures #wanderlust #trek #funnygirls #hikerhunger

I explained the situation to her and told me to head her way. <br>I reached Old Albany Post Rd. and, amazingly, I was able to get an Uber which would catch the Hudson Line in Peekskill, which would take me to Grand Central Station; the subway would get me to Beth‚Äôs on the Upper West Side. While waiting for my ride, a dragonfly landed on my finger. This is usually thought to be an omen of good luck; I‚Äôll take all I can get today, I thought to myself. Soon, I was RICEing my legs on Beth‚Äôs couch. *RICE: Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation  #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atclassof2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020 #newyork #newyorkcity

Inn > Graymoor Spiritual Life Center (1413.0/+7.3) I spent the morning w Beth, then once she departed at checkout (11am) I hiked past the deserted children‚Äôs zoo and empty swimming pool, both made lonely by COVID. Then I crossed the Hudson River, an emotional milestone. I met Super Trooper and Dicky on the other side, then Sherpa Mike a little farther on. <br>By mid-afternoon I made it to the Appalachian Deli, where Viking and Tablesaw had each grabbed a picnic table. Luckily there was one for me. I loaded up on resupplies, and devoured an Appalachian Trail sandwich washed down w Gatorade. Soon JERMS joined us, and then Crush, a thru hiker who did the trail in 2019. We peppered him w questioned about the remainder of the trail from here. He assured us that the rest of New York, along with Connecticut and Massachusetts, was less challenging terrain than what we‚Äôd recently experienced, which was a relief. He said the White Mountains were ridiculously up-and-down, but doable if patient, and that Maine was mostly a beautiful walk in the woods. I couldn‚Äôt wait. Talking to Crush was some of the best Trail Magic we had received during our whole journey. <br>The four of us ventures on to the Graymoor Spiritual Life Center, a peaceful place maintained by Franciscan friars who made the outfield of the baseball field available to thru hikers. It had a water spigot, a shower, and an extension cord we could use to recharge our devices. <br>Viking hiked on, and JERMS, Tablesaw and I shared tales of the Trail over dinner at the picnic tables before retreating to our tents for the night. #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atclassof2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020 #newyork

We strategically decided on a sunrise hike so we could beat the high 80s heat forecast, with the added bonus of hiking in the dark so we wouldn't have to actually see how steep it was. We summited just in time for the sun peaking up over the horizon.<br><br>As it turned out, the way up wasn't really as exhausting as I assumed, even at three in the morning. It was the descent I should have been more concerned about - straight down over wet, slippery rocks with the occasional wooden steps built into them. But I felt a lot better about how scared I was of falling and how long it took when I saw the sign at the bottom.

I‚Äôm sitting by Knob Creek, the first heavily flowing body of water I‚Äôve seen in days. Yesterday, I spent what may have been 45 minutes trying to collect water from what was generously a puddle. <br>I stayed by myself last night in every sense of the word. My two friends, Mandi and Eric, both drove off for home yesterday afternoon after a joyous few days of camping. I miss their company. As much as I was looking forward to doing this trek solo, I enjoy the camradery of people. Like splitting a bottle of Fireball, laughing and getting tipsy as the rain petered down around us. Like talking to each other from the comforts of our sleeping bags in our own closed tents. Like waking up to pick things up right where we left off.<br><br>Yesterday, I spent the night utterly alone. I was the only person at Standing Indian shelter‚Äôs campsite. No one to say hi to, let alone a tent to take mental note that someone else is here. I‚Äôm not afraid of people here, not really. So long as I‚Äôm more than a mile from a busy road, strangers don‚Äôt concern me. <br>I‚Äôm obsessed with the dire needs of bears, namely of my food and to smell inside my tent. Being alone meant I had to confront that fear myself.<br><br>I struggled to hang a bear bag. After searching for a branch long enough to hold my bags and far enough from camp to let me sleep, I kept knotting up the line when I threw it. When I finally got a line up, I forgot to clip it so I could make a proper PCT bear hang, and then the rope broke. I eventually got it hung and listened through the night to sounds resembling bears in the brush cruising for a tuna snack. <br>A fat bird kept flying around in the morning, it‚Äôs wings sounding like the huff or chuff of a bear. But alas, no bear peeked it‚Äôs nose under my tent. No bear pulled or knawed down my bear bags. I came away unscathed and when I realized that this morning, I thanked the Lord. <br>I need to have faith I will find a new group of people to camp with. I have faith. <br>#athiker #at2020thruhike #atnobo2020 #atflipflop #campingalone #womenwhohike

Inn (1405.7/+9.7) Viking and I awoke at first light and saw, not 100 yards away, the shelter that had been our late night goal yesterday. We had made it after all. The light we had seen was the headlamp of a hammocker off in the trees; apparently he hadn‚Äôt replied bc he wasn‚Äôt at the shelter, but was nonetheless interested in our presence. <br>I found the trail, then looked and looked for blazes. I spent a good five minutes searching for the way forward when I looked up the impossibly steep and rocky incline... and found it at the top. The path I least wanted to take. <br>Once cresting that rise the Trail wasn‚Äôt as merciless as it had been the day before. After nine miles we came to some beautiful benches overlooking mountains over which we had come at the top of Bear Mountain. The Perkins Memorial Tower was a sight to behold, but even more so were the nearby... vending machines! Viking and I each got 2 Powerades and an ice cream. <br>It was 10:30am; we had made good time. We walked down the stone stairs past throngs of day hikers, then I entered the Bear Mountain Inn. I checked in, and headed straight for the shower. Soon Beth arrived to find me clean - but not my clothes. The Inn did not offer guest laundry, so I did the best I could in the sink. It was a long, filthy process. I used the hair dryer to dry my shirts, shorts and socks. <br>The Inn‚Äôs restaurant and most facilities were closed, but Beth had brought some gin and limes. We ordered 2 pizzas and soda waters to complete the meal, which we decided to eat on a bench just outside. Beth lives on the Upper West Side of Manhattan and hadn‚Äôt gotten many chances to be in the great outdoors. We enjoyed a lovely evening in each other‚Äôs company.  #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atclassof2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020 #newyork #bearmountain #bearmountaininn

My legs were tired and sore, I ran out of vitamin I, the heat was oppressive, the rocks were impossibly steep, the trail was poorly marked so I got lost for the first time ever, there wasn‚Äôt a lot of water available, and an aggressive bear was haunting the vicinity of one of the shelters along the way. On top of all that I needed to cover a lot of ground in order to meet my girlfriend Beth at the Bear Mountain Inn at noon the next day. <br>I started at 6:45am, but the going was so rough I made it only 9 miles by 3pm (usually I could do 10+ by 12pm). I pushed my way through the Lemon Squeeze, a tight slot between rock slabs that made me wish I had taken my pack off to negotiate it. <br>I kept plugging away, and as the sun set I caught up to Viking, who was making dinner on a log. We commiserated, and I mentioned my lack of ibuprofen, and he gave me some Motrin. I normally made it a policy not to share items from other hikers due to COVID, but I‚Äôd known Viking for greater than a quarantine period and besides, relieving my throbbing knee was of paramount importance. <br>I needed to push on to at least the William Brien Memorial Shelter, 3.5 miles on, I explained, and Viking agreed to accompany me. Shortly thereafter, to make things more challenging, my phone ran out of power; Viking‚Äôs had earlier in the day. So we couldn‚Äôt check GPS to figure out how close we were to our destination. We hiked for two hours in the dark until we finally saw a light about a hundred yards away to our right. ‚ÄúHello!‚Äù I called out. No answer. We hiked a short distance further and our headlamps illuminated a large white tent. Exhausted, we decided that we could not take another step, and cowboy camped on a flat low spot nearby. <br>It was 11pm. I collapsed and was immediately asleep. I had hiked 20 miles in 16 hours, a pace of 1.25mph, about half my normal pace. #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atclassof2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020

There were excellent views to the northwest from the boulder pile at the top of the ridge. <br>On the way up, I met an older but very muscular and fit gentleman who must have been in his 60‚Äôs, w snow white hair and beard. He asked me if I was thru hiking, and when I said I was he said ‚ÄúI hiked the trail 40 years ago.  I was 1 of 9 who hiked SOBO, and there were 150 who hiked NOBO.‚Äù I mentioned that I was 2020 registrant #715 when I started, amazed at how the trail‚Äôs popularity had grown. <br>I asked him what his trail name was. ‚ÄúI hiked w 2 other guys and we called ourselves Hickory Dickory Doc.‚Äù I asked which of the three he was. ‚ÄúWe never distinguished. We were just known by that name collectively.‚Äù I supposed I wouldn‚Äôt have wanted to get stuck w the name Dickory, so their approach seemed sensible. ‚ÄúI have advice for you,‚Äù the sage hiker said. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget time look left and right every once in a while.‚Äù Excellent Trail wisdom, I thought.<br><br>By mid-afternoon I made it to my ninth state - New York! And was immediately put to the test. It was as if t state said ‚ÄúYou want a piece of me, hiker? I‚Äôll give you rocks and poorly marked trails! I‚Äôll give you a hike!‚Äù It was brutal, but there were some nice views of Greenwood Lake.<br><br>By 7:30pm I reached the Bellvale Creamery, a popular destination for locals and hikers alike. I had been warned of the hour-long wait for ice cream, and again bc of the hot Father‚Äôs Day the line of masked patrons was exceptionally lengthy. I instead opted to recharge my electronics at the charging station and get potable water from the spigot.  I hiked 2 miles to the Wildcat Shelter, and tented near Iron Heart, Cowboy and Tablesaw. #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atclassof2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020

Jedi texted me to say he might be headed for the ‚ÄúSecret Shelter‚Äù today. Secret Shelter? I thought. Sounds intriguing. I got there mid-morning and was greeted by Jake, a donkey who lives on the property (owned by a former thru hiker). You might say he‚Äôs the world‚Äôs only... Jake-ass! ü§£ü§£ü§£ I found an outdoor shower on a nearby building, and since Jake‚Äôs eyes were the only ones to shock, I stripped down and cleaned up. The shower was luxurious!<br><br>I soon heard a car coming up the dirt road so I threw my shorts back on. A small car w 5 teenagers inside pulled up. The one who I assumed was the leader hopped out. ‚ÄúYou hiking the whole Trail?‚Äù He asked. ‚ÄúYup,‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs crazy,‚Äù he said, impressed. He asked a few more questions and always said ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs crazy‚Äù in response to my replies. Finally, their plans to no doubt hang at the shelter dashed, the pack drive away. <br>Soon Jim Murray, the owner of the shelter property, showed up w Zen Dragon, a woman who tended some chickens and ducks in a nearby coop. I had a brief conversation w Jim and then napped on the deck, w Jake grazing nearby. <br>After my nap I packed up and headed downhill a couple miles to Horler‚Äôs deli, just over the state line in Unionville, New York. They had everything a hiker needs, so I loaded up w supplies, including two Italian sandwiches (lunch + dinner) and three bacon-egg-and-cheeses (breakfasts), various clif bars, oatmeal, trail mix. My lunch also included my favorite trail delicacy - Gatorade - and a pint of mint chocolate chip. <br>I got back to the trail and ended up hiking w Spice and Sherpa Mike. We heard thunder and hurried along to find water and a campsite before any rain came down. We came to a stream and cameled up; I pitched my tent but the other two hiked on. #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atclassof2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020 #newjersey

The terrain in New Jersey has some rocky spots, but generally is flatter and smoother than Rocksylvania, so this seemed doable. <br>I passed Colonel Clothesline + Sunset, who had started a NOBO thru hike, then got off the trail due to COVID, then jumped ahead to get to Katahdin while the weather was still good. They were doing 12-15 mile days and their feet hurt. I gave them some advice on what helped me and then pushed on. <br>I caught up to Spice and Grimm at the Mashipacong Shelter, where there was a cache of 30 gallons of water in the bear box - like finding gold on a hot day like today. <br>I finally got to High Point (the highest point in NJ) around 8:30 and ate my dinner at an observation deck overlooking the High Point Obelisk. The magenta of the twilight sky along w lights at the foot of the monument gave it a beautiful ethereal quality. <br>After dinner, I hiked to the High Point Shelter (half a mile on) and found it unoccupied. I heard thunder in the distance, so I set up shop in the shelter for the night. My longest hike yet. #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atclassof2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020 #newjersey

Planned changed a bit though when Bounce got coffee and bacon-egg-and-cheeses for all of us from the Dunkin next door. Hiked across the Delaware River on the I-80 walkway and into - New Jersey! State #8! <br>The terrain was fairly forgiving, though there were some rocky stretches. Bounce soon passed me; then, I re-injured my right calf (slightly). While fetching water in a stream I met Kodak, a woman who started in Georgia, got off after COVID spread, and who was now flip-flopping and heading north. <br>I passed a beaver bog and three beavers immediately tried to scare some away by slapping their tails upon the water. It had the opposite effect - I had to get a vid of them doing it. <br>With the late start (9:30am) I decided that a 24-mile day to the next Shelter was a bit ambitious, and I pitched my tent at one of the many campsites along the ridge. Since I had the place to myself I shucked all my grimy clothes and let them dry out on a rock while I aired out my skin. <br>I fell asleep to the sounds of coyotes and a whippoorwill. <br>#at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atclassof2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020 #newjersey

Between Wind Gap and Wolf Rocks it seemed like one boulder field or rock scramble after another. Exhausting!<br><br>Finally, I made my way down the ridge to Delaware Water Gap. I grabbed a pizza at Doughboy‚Äôs (packing out half for later, of course). Then I got a mint chocolate chip cone at the Village Farmer Bakery, and walked up to Sango Kura, a sake brewery. There I found Waldo talking to...Bounce, a hiker I had not seen since my third day on the trail at Mountain Crossings back in Georgia. Bounce explained he had taken a bit of a break in Pennsylvania bc he has family there. He introduced me to The other person at their cafe table, a younger guy named Hungry. ‚ÄúI am Hungry,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúUsually I am too,‚Äù I joked. Hungry and Bounce we‚Äôre splitting a room at the motel up the street and said I was welcome to join them. I figured since, like me, they‚Äôd been on the trail for weeks, the risk of COVID was low, and besides it was getting late and sharing a room would save me some moola. Hungry had a guitar and let me play, so I gave them a rendition of James Taylor‚Äôs ‚ÄúCarolina On My Mind‚Äù.

I had a hard time figuring out the bridge situation, a train derailment took out the WV side of the bridge and cost me a lot of time in the morning. The day took me through Maryland and a lot of historic information in the parks. I have a lot of pictures for my history buffs coming next. #jessallthingsrunning #appalachiantrail2020 #appalachiantrail #thruhike #hikelikeagirl #atclassof2020 #appalachiantrailclassof2020 #allwomenalltrails #womenthathike #athikethru #nobo #atnobo2020 #whiteblaze #georgiatomaine #backpacking #optoutside #withguthook #hike #hiking #camping #trekking #trailrunning #outdooradventure #outdoors #naturelover #mountain #mountains #throughhike #boostoxygen

The terrain was fairly easy once up in the ridge line. <br>I got to Smith Gap by lunchtime and found a large cache of water - very welcome, bc water is scarce in this neck of the woods. <br>Then for a trip down memory lane. As a boy 40 years ago I had lived about a mile from Smith Gap. I descended down Smith Gap Road to see the old neighborhood. <br>First I came to Evergreen Lake, at the base of Blue Mountain. It was as if time had stood still. It was well stocked w trout and so was a popular place to fish. As I relaxed in the shade, I got a text. It was from Brian Unangst, a reporter w a local TV station. An old friend of mine, Marie Johns, also works at the station and had caught wind of my hike. Brian came out to interview me, bringing along a Whopper, fries, and milkshake at my request. <br>Then I walked up the street to my old house on Copella Road. As I came up the driveway, I greeted the current owner, Cindy Van Dine. When I explained I was hiking the AT and had lived there four decades ago, she offered to show me around and introduced me to her husband David.<br><br>As fate would have it, our old neighbors across the street, Joe and Judy Shecks, still lived there after all this time. Joe came out to meet me. He now had snowy white hair! I remembered it as jet black. We reminisced, and afterwards he gave me a beer and a ride back to the trailhead. I camped about .3 miles further and marveled at an amazing day. #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atclassof2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020 #pennsylvania

Outerbridge Shelter. I had planned to stay there and hike up Lehigh Gap first thing in the morning when it was cooler, but George W was pretty ratty, and occupied by a big black snake.  Not great camping nearby. <br>Two young gap year girls came by. Their names were Corgi and Drifter, and they had just started a flip-flop thru hike from the Allentown Shelter (bc they were from Philadelphia). Corgi thought she might have Lyme disease bc she didn‚Äôt feel quite right, but a test had come back negative. They hiked on... My friend Steve, who had met me in Hamburg, came out to see me again, so I hiked down the hill and across the bridge that spanned the Lehigh River to meet him. On the way I heard a shout: another hiker had found my dirty water bag on the bridge; it had apparently fallen out of my pack. The Trail did provide: I would have been in big trouble w/o that bag! <br>Steve met me and we drove to the Berlinsville Hotel and Tavern outside Walnutport and had a socially distant dinner on their deck. I had a Lehigh Gap meatloaf sandwich and a mule. <br>As we drove back, Steve turned to me and said ‚ÄúYou smell.‚Äù Of course! I‚Äôm a thru hiker!<br><br>Steve dropped me off at the parking area for Lehigh Gap and watched as I set up my tent. He was interested in taking his three young sons hiking on the AT, and peppered me w questions about camping. It was a good night w an old friend. #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atclassof2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020 #pennsylvania h

I stopped for lunch at the Allentown Hiking Club Shelter, then hiked across a boulder field labeled the Knife‚Äôs Edge, but bc I live in Maine and have hiked Katahdin‚Äôs Knife Edge I called it the Other Knife‚Äôs Edge. Later, I found a cache of what had been trail magic: water and Gatorade - but all were empty!üòÇüòÇüòÇ I was dismayed to see all the graffiti on the rocks at Bake Oven Knob; but I could see the whole ridge to beyond Wind Gap, as well as Allentown in the distance. My ol‚Äô stompin‚Äô grounds. <br>About a half mile further I camped near the Bale Oven Knob Shelter. Wiki and Webo were nearby. #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atclassof2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachiantrail2020 #appalachianmountains #pennsylvania

Hardly slept a wink. My rain fly kept making noises I was convinced belonged to breathing, four legged creatures wanting to eat me. Lonely owls called for each other and I heard a terrible yelp or cry, I knew not which.<br><br>Turns out no one came to eat me or my food. Not sure what happened to the owls but the alarming cry came from my soon-to-be-new-friend, Crocks. A long-distance runner, he‚Äôd been pushing himself too hard to get too many miles. His body wasn‚Äôt having it. He‚Äôd puked last night out of his hammock into his Crocks.<br><br>Day 4 <br>June 9<br>I began talking to my water bottle today. It was being very uncooperative. ... I hear woodpeckers on the daily and other birds tweeting around me. Haven‚Äôt seen many though, save a warbler or two. I walk around with a bell to let bears know I‚Äôm coming. Turns out it warns birds I‚Äôm coming, too. I‚Äôd like to see more birds. Until then, I‚Äôll listen for them.<br><br>Day 6<br>June 11 <br>I climbed Blood Mountain today, the highest mountain in Georgia. As I lay down to sleep, I can see a well-known hiker store and hostel, Mountain Crossings, where people throw their terrible hiking shoes into trees. They have a huge AT sign there and I posed with it, smiling. I smile all the time now. As I lay in my tent a short walk from the road, all I can hear is the rustling of the leaves and the occasional roar from strange creatures known as cars. #athiker #at2020thruhike #atnobo2020 #atclassof2020 #at2020 #atflipflop #hiker #hikingadventures #happyhiker #happyhiker #adventurenthusiasts #adventuretime #nobo #sobo #womenexplore_

Back then, I was even more of a noob than when I walked through that arch at Amicalola this February.<br><br>Water filtration hadn't yet shown up on my radar. This was before I was talked into buying a $70 Katadyn pump by an REI employee, and it would be another year or so after that until the words "sawyer" and "squeeze" made any sense to me when put together. I'm pretty sure I packed out two full 1.5 liter Smartwater bottles and rationed them for drinking and cooking the night and two days I was out there. I remember being exhausted after the 10 mile trek from the trailhead to the campsite on Glastenbury Mountain, and terrified climbing up this fire tower.<br><br>Today, as a thru-hiker, I don't carry more than a single liter of water at a time (unless water sources are scarce) in my Smartwater with a Sawyer screwed on top. This time, Glastenbury and the tower were just a part of an ordinary 23 mile day. I climbed each without much strain or fear (though fire towers still aren't my favorite). It was a cool moment of reflection to see this view again, and realize how far I've come, not just in distance on the AT, but in strength and skill. I'm already in the best shape of my life hands down, and I still have NH and ME to kick my ass a whole lot more.

It‚Äôs officially closed and watched over by a caretaker, Mick, who lives in the house. Mick instructed all to camp in a field across the street, but we were allowed to get water from a spigot, and charge our phones and batteries.  #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020

First, the terrain is pretty difficult - this section includes the Priest and Three Ridges. But second, we‚Äôve been caught in the remnants of a tropical storm for the past week (we first got the surprise rain storm the day before Glasgow on Monday 6/15). It‚Äôs been overcast and cool most days, with periods of light rain and then roaring downpours every couple hours. I‚Äôve been wet for 5 days now üòÇ Leaving Glasgow, @proudfeat and I wanted to push some bigger miles, so we started off with our first marathon on the AT, followed by a 24, and I followed that up yesterday with a 27. 77 miles in 3 days! The night before last (I am in Waynesboro VA currently) we were forced to tent during another deluge and absolutely everything I own got soaked - including my down quilt, so I knew I had to get to town that night. I was so thrilled to get to Rockfish Gap, the start of the Shenandoahs (and the end of those 27 miles) around 8pm last night! A difficult stretch of days on the #appalachiantrail for sure, but I‚Äôm still very grateful to be out here. The new goal is 1000 miles by July 1! #atnobo2020 #atthruhike2020 #va

It started out well enough, after yesterday‚Äôs marathon. I passed Raptor, a 40-something guy I hadn‚Äôt seen since we had breakfast together at Mountain Harbor 800 miles ago in Tennessee. He was hiking w two other 50-something men. <br>I stopped at the Pilger Ruh (Pilgrim‚Äôs Rest), √° fSt flowing spring found by Moravian missionaries in the 1700‚Äôs. <br>Moving on, I pulled a muscle in my right calf. At first I thought I would t be able to go further today, but I finally hobbled on. I limped to the 1200 mile mark. Gradually, my leg felt somewhat better, but it was still slow going madd even slower by the rocks. <br>At one point I glanced to my right and in the bushes I saw the feathery tail of a timber rattlesnake in the bushes. He was very quiet and still until he realized I had spotted him, at which point he coiled his head and hissed at me, more loudly than a tabby cat. I got the hell outta there... I then came to a sign on which someone had scrawled ‚ÄúCAUTION: RATTLESNAKES!!‚Äù I was on the alert, limping over rocks for 2 mile until - finally! - I reached the Eagle‚Äôs Nest Shelter, where I shared the details of my arduous journey with Raptor, Spice, Little Flower, and...Waldo, wh I hadn‚Äôt seen since Waynesboro, VA, some 300 miles ago.  #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020

Today I got a jump on things. With a good early start and favorable terrain that slopes gently down a ridge for nine miles, I managed to hike 13+ miles by 11:30am. I decided to try to make this my first marathon day (hiking 26.2 miles). At mile 15 I came to Stony Creek, which had been dammed up by beavers. I had to ford the creek by walking across the top of the dam, which was submerged by 2 feet, in my  crocs (my ‚Äúcamp shoes‚Äù that I usually wore at the end of the day). Later, while getting water at another creek, I watched as a very old woman tried to cross on the rickety logs that served as a bridge. ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt they put a bridge here?‚Äù She whined indignantly. Her companion, a younger woman, explained that a couple years ago she had hiked the trail w an even older woman friend of hers, and that friend had become the oldest woman to hike the AT. This lady was in training to break her friend‚Äôs record when she was old enough - in 2022. <br>While in the home stretch of my marathon, I glanced down and happened to see a pocket knife lying on the trail. It was in excellent condition. ‚ÄúSomeone‚Äôs going to be missing this,‚Äù I thought, so I picked it up and carried it on. I was right. When I got to the William Penn Shelter (marathon day achieved!), I met a young gal named Fern who asked me if I‚Äôd seen a black knife. Voil√° - I produced it for her, and she couldn‚Äôt have been happier. We ate dinner together w Dragon - no, make that Draggin‚Äô (as in ‚ÄúDraggin‚Äô my ass‚Äù) he said. <br>After good conversation, I pitched my tent at a good campsite across the trail from the shelter after dark.  #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020

You must endure the nasty days to really appreciate the wonderful weather on days. #jessallthingsrunning #appalachiantrail2020 #appalachiantrail #thruhike #hikelikeagirl #atclassof2020 #appalachiantrailclassof2020 #allwomenalltrails #womenthathike #athikethru #nobo #atnobo2020 #whiteblaze #georgiatomaine #backpacking #optoutside #withguthook #hike #hiking #camping #trekking #trailrunning #outdooradventure #outdoors #naturelover #mountain #mountains #throughhike

Turns out he‚Äôs from Kennebunkport, of all places! He told me he was trying to catch up to some really fast hikers - like Waldo, he said, who hiked 45 miles one day. This did not sound like the Waldo I knew at all. But it was good to know some of the folks I had been hiking with before I went to the Smokies were nearby. <br>I made my way through lonely Duncannon, across the Juniata and wide Susquehanna rivers, and up a very rocky slope to the ridge. <br>Eventually I got to the Peters Mountain shelter and had lunch. Once again Fast Food caught me (he had to wait for stores to open in Duncannon to resupply) He now told me that Triple B and Shotput, who had been ahead of me before I left for the Smokies, were behind me. <br>The path down to the spring was so steep and so far (.3 mile) that some trail angels had provided 2 gallon jugs, but unfortunately they were nearly empty. Water was scarce between here and my destination so I ducked it up and made the trek down and back. <br>I hiked on until I got to my goal for the day: a camp site along the ridge. I had to share it w an older section hiker from Lancaster. No matter, he was friendly enough.  #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020 #pennsylvania

I hoped to get some real coffee from the convenience store just down the street, and while they were scheduled to open at 6am, no  attendant showed up. Alas!<br><br>The path out of Boiling Springs was mainly a green tunnel between fields and farms. I clocked my fastest mile time: 3.6 mph on a flat stretch here. At the Cove Mountain shelter I had dinner w Miz Man, an older hiker who had attempted a thru hike in 2018 and had made it as far as Vermont before taking a nasty fall, cracking a tooth, and leading him to quit short of the ultimate goal. I then set up my tent on a remnant of road a short way back towards the trail.  #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020 #pennsylvania

A section hiker had set up his hammock to the right of my tent, and at dawn I heard him rustling, as I was preparing my breakfast in my tent. Suddenly, I heard rustling to my left. How had he gotten over there. ‚ÄúBear!‚Äù He said calmly but loudly. ‚ÄúWhere?‚Äù I said loudly, trying to spook  any such bear. <br>There was a rustling to the left of my tent, as the Bear - fortunately - scurried away. ‚ÄúI guess he likes lattes,‚Äù I joked, as I had been preparing a Starbuck‚Äôs instant latte, a favorite of mine, as my morning cup o‚Äô joe. <br>I began hiking to Standing Bear Hostel at 7am. After a nearly 3-mile stretch to Mt. Cammerer, the Trail heads dowwwwwwwwwn 6 miles to Standing Bear. On the way, I got caught in a heavy thunderstorm, but fortunately the downpour hit just as I was going through a green tunnel of rhododendrons, so I was somewhat protected, not that I minded the rain. <br>I got to Standing Bear and had a pepperoni pizza washed down with 3 cokes, before catching my ride to Knoxville for the night. <br>I caught up w Empty Space, A Mainer hiking the Trail who was headed back up to Harper‚Äôs Ferry. We congratulated each other and exchanged phone numbers. It seemed likely we might meet again up north.  #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020 #bear #blackbear #breakfast

The boys from Alabama soon joined me, and I overheard them mention that one of them would be starting football practice soon. ‚ÄúHow will that work?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll be spaced out properly and when there are drills that call for huddling, everyone will wear masks,‚Äù the father said. ‚ÄúWhat about the regular season?‚Äù ‚ÄúI think they‚Äôre just going to let them play.‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt believe what I was hearing. It sounded like a recipe for disaster. I was glad I wasn‚Äôt hiking towards Alabama. <br>I *was* hiking towards Cosby Knob Shelter. When I got there around 3pm, I found John Heywood taking a snooze. I tried to do the same, but was swarmed by gnats and black flies. <br>John and I, along with another hiker, decided to pitch our tents just up the hill along the trail, so we could crawl inside and seek refuge from the insects. No sooner had we done so than we heard thunder. Our timing was certainly off today. It would be nice to sleep in a shelter during a thunderstorm, but since we had pitched we were committed. It rained hard most of the night.  #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020

Alas! When I arrived at the tower atop the mountain, it was shrouded in thick fog. I hiked on. <br>I reached Newfound Gap by lunchtime, and by then the sun had come out and shine brightly. Legions of day hikers swarmed the nearby trails. Most people were careful, stepping aside to give good social distance when passing and otherwise being polite. But I was reminded of the words of the ranger I had met at McAfee Knob: ‚ÄúWe closed the parks and trailheads because every day was like Labor Day...‚Äù. My original plan was to hike to the Icewater Spring Shelter area, but bc I reached it by early afternoon and bc I heard that rain may be coming tomorrow, I deciddd to press on another 7 miles to Peck‚Äôs Corner. <br>The scenery got more and more majestic the further north and East I hiked through the park. I walked along a knife edge ridge w mountains all around. <br>When I reached Peck‚Äôs, I received some welcome trail magic. A man from Alabama section hiking w a group of teen boys had one of his sons fetch water ‚Äúfor the thru hiker‚Äù. The Trail does provide.<br><br>Then, another surprise: also at the shelter was a man from Chattanooga who said his name was John Heywood. When he found out I was from Portland, Maine, he said he worked at Unum (Unum‚Äôs two main offices are in Portland and Chattanooga). I asked him if he knew my friend Dave Collins, who had recently retired from Unum. Incredibly, John said he did.

Fairly uneventful hiking and not too many views this day. Got to the Double Springs Gap shelter in late afternoon and met an older gentleman from Lubbock, Texas who was the first LifeFlight helicopter pilot in Maine during the mid-80‚Äôs. He lived in Lewiston and worked for Central Maine Medical Center. Small world!<br><br>I camped under. Pine stand up the hill with another older gent from Massachusetts. As we were settling down for the night another man walked by. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a game warden and I‚Äôm hunting wild boar,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúSo if you hear gunshots, it‚Äôs only me.‚Äù Boar are an invasive species that have been digging up the trail as they search for grins. <br>It was good of the warden to explain himself, bc later we heard three shots ring out, followed by the gutteral squeal of a boar.  #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020

Today was a completely different story - beautiful weather: sunny, warm but not humid at all. <br>I picked up the trail at the Fontana Marina and soon hiked by the Fontana Dam Shelter, affectionately known as the ‚ÄúFontana Hilton‚Äù. Then it was over the gigantic dam itself and uphill into Great Smoky Mountains National Park. I climbed nearly 3,000 feet in elevation to some ledges offering a spectacular view to the northwest - a good spot to have lunch. <br>Made it to the Russell Field Shelter where I reunited with Empty Space and Jet, whom I hadn‚Äôt seen since since the Easter dinner at Boots Off hostel. They were on the same mission. I pitched my tent, and before I fell asleep a pack of coyotes began to howl to each other not far away. Fortunately, their choir practice didn‚Äôt last too long. #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020

Viking was off first the next morning and soon texted me to remind me to stop at Green Mountain General Store for 2nd breakfast. I did, and made use of their ‚Äúprivy‚Äù and TP so as not to cut into my supply. I got caught in another afternoon thundershower, which washed away the swelter, and decided that I liked hiking in the summer rain. <br>The rain stopped by the time I reached the outskirts of Boiling Springs. I made it to the Sugar Shack, where I had a root beer float as I once again dried out completely. The only space the local hostel could offer me was a couchbed for $40, so I opted instead to pitch my tent at a local campsite on the edge of town by the railroad tracks.  #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020

But I didn‚Äôt wear my rain gear (pack was covered) and it was refreshing.  Somehow I missed the official halfway marker (mile 1093.5) in the wet, but I found the unofficial, traditional halfway mark (the halfway point changes every year as sections of trail are added, subtracted, or rerouted). My phone was so damp the touchscreen wouldn‚Äôt work, so Bender did the honors for me and texted the photo you see. <br>Then it was on to the AT Museum in Pine Grove Furnace State Park and The Half Gallon Challenge, in which hikers absurdly try to down a half gallon of ice cream in order to win a tiny wooden spoon denoting their membership in the gluttonous club. I succeeded, downing my French Vanilla in 22 minutes. I immediately followed up w a Hiker Burger (fried egg, avocado, bacon, lettuce, tomato, onion). Then the sun came out, and I along with Viking, Bender, Dr. X, Shotgun, Laura Bee, Jello, Yard Sale, and others soaked up the rays as we completely dried out our drenched clothes. #hikerhunger  #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020

Suddenly, I startled a fawn that was trying to hide right on the Trail. I let the poor little devil calm down and then slowly walked by. <br>A short while later I made it to Chimney Rocks, where I met two lady day hikers. I told them I was headed to Quarry Gap Shelter that night. They said I was in for a treat, and when I got there it did not disappoint. The shelter, maintained w great affection by a caretaker, had hanging flower baskets, a skylight, a swing, and a box of board games. Viking came by and we played a game of chess and I remained undefeated on the trail. üòé<br><br>The two shelter areas were so clean that you could eat off the floor. I occupied one all to myself (rain was expected) and it was the first time I had slept in a shelter since the Bryant Ridge Shelter 325 miles ago.  #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020

The views were limitless and gorgeous, and we had a great time chatting with some of the locals who had made the day trip up (including a pair of newlyweds who shared their fruit and sliced peppers with us!) The end of the day brought us to Tinker Cliffs - where we could see the ridge we had just walked from McAfee. Yesterday was just one of those days that make the downpours, knee pain, and gallons of sweat worth it. #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #thruhike #mcafeeknob #tinkercliffs #va #triplecrown

I left the Appalachian Trail in March due to the coronavirus pandemic that was sweeping the globe. When I got home, I fell hard into ‚Äúpost trail depression‚Äù. I knew it was real in the backpacker community but I didn‚Äôt think I would really get it because I would be happy to be back with my friends and family. But when I got home, I couldn‚Äôt be with anyone. We were quarantined to our house and couldn‚Äôt leave. I didn‚Äôt want to do anything. I laid in bed and just watched tv. I didn‚Äôt get out of bed, I didn‚Äôt go outside. After a few weeks, I tried to get out of my funk. I started to get back into doing art and it started to help. Eventually, I was able to go back to work and I thought that would really help since I wouldn‚Äôt be stuck at home anymore. Unfortunately, it didn‚Äôt help. I fell back into my depression and have been struggling for weeks to feel better. I took a week off and went to Arizona and hiked on the AZT. It was such a relief. I felt alive again. I needed to feel that more. At this point, I need to do what is best for my mental health. I have decided to go back to the Appalachian Trail in a few weeks and continue on my hike. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll be there for a month or two or I stay and try to finish the whole thing. All I know if my mental health needs me to get better and this is how I feel I can do that. I plan to take all the precautions I can to minimize the probability of being exposed or exposing others. I will be bringing my mask for when I‚Äôm in town and having hand sanitizer with me. I know this isn‚Äôt the best timing to be going back but mental health is very important and I‚Äôve got to do what I‚Äôve got to do. I hope everyone understands that I have to do this for myself. Stay safe, be happy, and do what‚Äôs best for you. ‚úåüèºüåûü¶ã.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #AT2020 #ATnobo2020 #appalachiantrail2020 #appalachianlife #ATclassof2020 #trektheat #thetrek #withguthook #hikemoreworryless #optoutside #wekeepyououtdoors #hikertrash #thruhike #hikerlife #getlost #backpacking #hikerlife #outdoorlife #hiking #adventure #wanderlust

We incorrectly assumed we'd have the place to ourselves after dusk but were woken up at 12:30am by some people talking who were there to... party or stargaze on a cloudy night? Not sure. Then again at 4:45am by a group of high school kids who rolled in blasting "Ridin'" by Chamillionaire. Not my favorite kind of alarm, but at least we caught the sunrise.

He told me he started two days before in Harper‚Äôs Ferry; I didn‚Äôt have the heart to tell him I‚Äôd left HF *yesterday*. I told him the hills would get easier after his hiker legs came around.

I hiked a couple of flat miles along an old canal tow path. <br>This being Memorial Day, there were day hikers galore on the trail. <br>To paraphrase a famous American orator, it was ‚Äúentirely fitting and proper‚Äù that I passed several monuments on this holiday, including the Boonsboro Washington monument, placards commemorating the Civil War Battle of South Mountain (at Fox‚Äôs Gap), and even a stone memorializing Glenn P. Caveney, a young man who apparently loved these woods. <br>As dusk approached I hiked over I-70 and up a hill to the Pine Knob Shelter and came upon what seemed like an army of hikers encamped in about dozen tents spread about. I was lucky to get one of the few remaining spots. <br>#at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020

I ordered dinner to go, and as I waited for my meal I observed the dining room and the patio outside. All tables were full.

As soon as I see one of those white rectangles ahead my heartbeats a little bit faster and so much excitement sets in. After those feelings pass it slowly leads into a calmness. A sense of peace and the ability to breath a little deeper and it allows my mind to unwind and just let‚Äôs me be me stripped down to the core. The magic of those little bits of paint you see every so often transports me to where I want to be and long to be when I‚Äôm not near them. The mystery of what lies ahead and the journey in front of me pulls me further and further down this surreal narrow path that so many before me have traveled. .<br>.<br>What is it about these white blazes for you? .<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#whiteblaze #whiteblazer #at #appalachia #appalachian_explorers #appalachian #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #atsectionhike #atthruhike #atthruhike2020 #nobo #sobo #hiking #hikertrashvogue #hikertrash #hikerlife #hikersofinstagram #hike #hikerva #hikeva #hikevirginia #atnobo2020 #atsobo2020 #at2020 #virginia #traillife #hikerchick #thetrail #naturalvirginia

Woke up bright and early and were the 1st ones out of camp at 6:30 am.  We knew we were going to need to get a head start to climb out to Clingmans.  We had 2 more ü¶å young bucks to greet us grazing near our tent.  By the time we hit Siler Bald Shelter the young hikers were catching up to us so we sat, had a snack and chatted while we got our water resupply.  It was great hearing stories from so many backgrounds of ages and experiences.  Three young girls out for the week from Chicago area - Churchmouse, Questions and Answers! Appalachian Al and Ole Swimmer were experienced AT hikers from Kingsport, TN.  Just John was out hiking resupplying shelter logs along the AT NOBO.  We left a 30 yr helicopter medic pilot named Helo, from Lubbock, TX without a formal goodbye.  Several others without trail names still searching for their tramiy. <br>We were blessed to have met Bill the day before as he passed us climbing Thunderhead Mtn.  He was completing his goal of climbing the highest 100 peaks in NC.  Back at camp, we chatted and learned he was from East Asheville and decided to hitch a ride home for a few days.  The climbs were beautiful and hard on these two chics.  We climbed 11,655 ft in 32.5 miles over 3 days.  We still have some 39 miles left of the Smokies.  We will be back!<br><br>#at2020 #atnobo2020 #atlashers #shewillmovemountains #womenwhowander #hiking #hikersofinstagram #optoutside #AppalachianTrail #traillife #backpacking #2Chics4Feet #mountainchicks #Clingmansdome #hikingadventures #sheexplores #sectionhiker #idhikethat

I got a chance to catch up on current events and my heart is broken for George Floyd and the current situation the country is in.  It‚Äôs a surreal situation coming from the trail where I see no one for days to coming back to the real world and learning of this injustice. #jessallthingsrunning #appalachiantrail2020 #appalachiantrail #thruhike #hikelikeagirl #atclassof2020 #appalachiantrailclassof2020 #allwomenalltrails #womenthathike #athikethru #nobo #atnobo2020 #whiteblaze #georgiatomaine #backpacking #optoutside #withguthook #hike #hiking #camping

Maybe this is biased coming from someone raised hiking on rocky New England trails, but I thought PA's terrain was definitely annoying but manageable and flat af. If you've made it that far (1200 or so miles) you're more than capable, try not to let your mind hype it up too much and you'll be OK. This whole thing is really a mind game afterall. That being said, I have no desire to ever come back to section this unnecessarily jagged, viewless state again.

Some wore masks, and most were mindful of social distancing, moving off trail to let me pass or thanking me for doing so. <br>When I got into town I realized that West Virginia had just allowed restaurants to reopen if they seated dining parties at least six feet apart. I sat on the back patio of one establishment and had a pulled pork sandwich and 3 vanilla milkshakes. <br>I then walked up to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy HQ where I had arranged the meet Chris Lienhard, an old high school classmate who lives near Harper‚Äôs Ferry and whom I hadn‚Äôt seen in 35 years. It was great to compare notes and find out what Chris had been up to since we gathered our diplomas. <br>Walking through town I bumped into Viking, who told me he was staying at the Town‚Äôs Inn, a 200 year old stone building in the center of town. The innkeeper heard me and offered me.

I did this in the mist and rain, so there were no views and the rocks were wet and needed to be negotiated carefully. Normally, the Bear‚Äôs Den, a hostel run by the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, would be a welcome way-station after this section, but this was not a normal year and like other ATC facilities it was closed. <br>But other milestones made this day special. I passed the 1000-mile mark, and finally reached my 5th state, West Virginia! #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020

This happens more and more as we they hikers head further north, and it feels just as good. At this point, nearly 1000 miles down the trail, many people ask if I‚Äôm through hiking, and when I tell them I am they respond with ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs great!‚Äù, ‚ÄúKeep it up!‚Äù, ‚ÄúGo get ‚Äòem!‚Äù, and ‚ÄúGood luck!‚Äù Today, a day hiker approached and asked ‚ÄúAre you Fly By Night?‚Äù I replied that I was, thinking maybe she was passing along a message from a fellow thru-er a little farther along. I asked how she knew my name. ‚ÄúI follow you on Instagram,‚Äù she said. Right then and there I realized I had arrived and was now Internet Famous. üòé<br><br>I hiked past Sky Meadows State Park,  beautiful open fields that had an ethereal quality in the day‚Äôs mist. Towards the end of the day I saw my first sign for - Harper‚Äôs Ferry! The long trek through Virginia would soon be over. <br>I camped near the Rod Hollow Shelter, where a young couple from Lynchburg was staying w their three dogs. They wondered what I would do after I got to Katahdin. ‚ÄúMaybe I‚Äôll keep going to Canada,‚Äù I quipped. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs cool,‚Äù said the man, ‚ÄúI hear the Trail continues all the way to Greenland.‚Äù üò≥ #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020

Great hike into NOC.  Growing up and visiting the Nantahala Gorge as a kid/young adult made me want to hike this section even more.  So happy to hike into the NOC today. <br>Made it into Bryson City for lunch at one of our favorites, High Test and had to stop by Loose Moose.

I was 5 miles in and heard a rustle in the bushes. Squirrels and birds generally sound the way a bear does in the bushes and that's all I thought it was. Nope. 10 feet away was a decent sized bear. He looked over and I went HIYAH. Then he ran. So happy to be in the blue ridge mountains again.

I resupplied at the stores in town and hit the road mid morning. I ended up at Little Laurel Shelter ( no phone service, sorry mom for not callingüòò). I somehow got off course around mile 5 and did 3.6 bonus miles but it was perfect weather and enjoyed all 23.66 miles yesterday. When I got to the shelter there was 1 other guy there with me and he said he left some trail magic in the spring for me when I go get water, it was an ice cold beer! I am wondering if this beer when I arrive after a long day of hiking will continue?? I sure hope so. #jessallthingsrunning #appalachiantrail2020 #appalachiantrail #thruhike #hikelikeagirl #atclassof2020 #appalachiantrailclassof2020 #allwomenalltrails #womenthathike #athikethru #nobo #atnobo2020 #whiteblaze #georgiatomaine

Sure there are cars and it‚Äôs not really nature, but this footbridge was the only thing I knew about the Appalachian Trail prior to 5 years ago. I‚Äôve passed it frequently in my life and remember passing it as a kid and wondering what it was and wanting to walk that bridge because I thought it was cool that it went over the highway. Well day 4 this week I got to walk it! Shout out to the one truck that honked, made my day! Especially since the immediate uphill to Annapolis Rocks sucked soooooooooo bad! After 7 days out, we made it to PA, and are taking a zero. Celebrated with eating salad. It truly was what I was craving after not having a big appetite this week. We took it slow and steady to make sure we didn‚Äôt over do it. But the last couple of days, my pack has felt more a part of me rather than a hindrance. And I feel my legs getting stronger. Now if only my feet would chill...I suppose that will never happen. :) #at2020 #atthruhike2020  #atflipflop #atflipflop2020 #atnobo2020 #atsobo2020 #hikerhunger #backpacking #hiking #kulacloth #trek @hikerhunger #funnygirl

I'm currently in Waynesboro, Virginia where I met my fiance for the first time in 2.5 months. I'm taking a vacation from my vacation. Yesterday was my first zero day since I've been on trail. I can start to feel my muscles tightening up. We've had a cold, rainy spell so I'm glad to be in a hotel right now. I've caught up on some chores like seam sealing my tarps. My baby hemmed my infamous unicorn pants into unicorn shorts. She was also able to use the leftover cloth to make a matching headband. While I'm eager to get back on trail I'm so happy she's here and we get to spend time together.

One head strap had already frayed off, and both shoulder straps were just days away from tearing off as well. Fortunately, the clerk at the outfitters - a man whose real name (not trail name) was Charlie Brown - was able to get a replacement from the same manufacturer at no charge! It was a slightly different model but had the same capacity as my old pack and was a pound lighter. It was slightly smaller (a medium instead of a medium-large) and the fit  not quite as good (I could feel it a bit in the small of my back) but for the price it is definitely worth a shot. The center of town was fairly empty, but showing more signs of life than most. <br>#at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020

I really should have gotten up well before that, but I had a headache for which I took some ‚Äúvitamin I‚Äù. This turned out to be a good thing because it helped give my feet staying power. The thing you need to know about Shenandoah National Park is that it‚Äôs pretty dry. This year, the situation is even worse, bc many ranger stations and campgrounds are closed, limiting the number of water sources available to thru hikers even further. I must have looked pretty bad by the time I got to Hightop Hut, bc another hiker at the shelter, Tic Tac, offered me a liter of her water (she had already been to the spring nearby). She filled my bottle, and I promptly guzzled it down all at once. Once again, I camped nearby. #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020

I had heard that the rangers who patrol Shenandoah Nat‚Äôl Park have a morning meeting about that time so we were less likely to be spotted entering the park - which had been officially closed more than a month ago due to the pandemic - at that time. <br>We hit the Trail and Jedi, a tall German, quickly outdistanced me. After he disappeared, I didn‚Äôt see another human being for the entire day. The path meandered uneventfully for miles, and crossed a very lonely Skyline Drive (closed to traffic and strewn w blow-down) several times. <br>Finally, at day‚Äôs end, I came to the Blackrock Hut, where Jedi was waiting for me. We were soon joined by Shotput and Triple B, who had had the bad luck to get soaked by a sudden, brief downpour moments before they reached the hut (I had made it just in time). When the rain stopped, I pitched my tent a short distance away, close to a burbling stream.  #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020

I had been spending too much time lately thinking about my feet and *not* thinking about much else, like the scenery. ‚ÄúCongratulations,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve reached the ‚Äòoveruse‚Äô stage. Not many people get that far.‚Äù He advised taking a couple zeroes and putting my feet up as much as possible, and massaging them several times throughout the day. So I did just that, comparing notes w many fellow hikers: Fonzie, Hot Pants,  Bender, Bear, Tom, Hot Sauce, Yardsale, Jello, Chickweed, Sassafras, and more. Many seemed to have feet that were suffering in one way or another, so my plight was not unusual at all.  #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020

So the name Meg, or Megatron, came to be.<br><br>I was cool with the Family Guy reference and how I got it but was never a big fan of the name Megatron itself, so I ended up changing it to Griffin. It's funny that the day I post this is also the day I am going to send that winter hat I've carried and worn since Georgia home. It's warming up and it's time to shave some ounces, even the namesake ones.

Pack is VERY full. It‚Äôs heavier than I expected. Heading to the #appalachiantrail tomorrow and I am very excited and nervous. Here‚Äôs to my ‚Äúwhy‚Äù. My reasoning for taking on this difficult and hopefully rewarding journey.<br>1) Time to process. Over the course of the past year there has been grief, sadness, and change. Time to process this with no distractions as well as figure out what‚Äôs next.<br>2) Spiritual growth. I would be lying if I said I was really thriving with my relationship with the Lord. It‚Äôs been a dry season and definitely related to the reasons behind number 1. <br>3) Happy endorphins from exercise. I‚Äôm not kidding. I love the feeling of confidence you get when you‚Äôve accomplished something you didn‚Äôt think you could do. Need to kick some mountain butt for a few sweet views.<br>4) Physical transformation. Not the primary purpose, but and added side effect to walking all day with a 30lb pack on your back up and down mountains. Side effect I will welcome with open arms. It‚Äôs not common for most women, but being overweight it will most likely happen.<br>5)Adventure, fun, community. Makes for great stories haha.<br>Here‚Äôs to the trail! Nerves, excitement, emotions, and all! <br>#appalachiantrail2020 #appalachiantrailflipflop #atflipflop2020 #atnobo2020<br>#atsobo2020 #backpacking #trek #adventure #funnygirls #hiking

Then, down, 3000 feet of elevation, then very steeply right back up 3000 feet to the top of Three Ridges Mountain. Then dinner at Maupin Field Shelter - where a deer calmly grazed right in front of me - and another 6.5 miles to a spot near Dripping Rock, the last portion of which I hiked after dark.  #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020

I was supposed to meet a shuttle driver to take me into Buena Vista, as my supplies were running low, at the Long Mountain Wayside at 7am. It was very cold, and by 7:30 my driver had not arrived. <br><br>A little desperate, I went across the road (US 60), and up a dirt road to a small, dilapidated house and knocked on the door. A tall, young man opened the door and once I explained my plight, agreed to take me into town. He waited in the parking lot of the Food Lion while I got my supplies. <br><br>I offered to buy him breakfast, but he refused and instead insisted on buying *me* breakfast, saying ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the one hiking the AT‚Äù. I offered to pay him for his trouble but again he refused, and said ‚ÄúThis will be my good deed for the day.‚Äù <br><br>Such kindness left me choked up as I hit the Trail - right on schedule, I might add - and I vowed to pay it forward as often as I could. <br><br>With my spirits lifted, I had a great day hiking, and pitched my tent near  Spy Rock, a great place from which to see a panoramic sunset and sunrise.  I pitched my tent as the Moon began to rise. <br><br>#at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020

Reached the Thunder Hill Shelter, fetched water, and met Jedi. I congratulated him on his 32 mile hike earlier in the week. <br>Jedi turned out to be the only person I‚Äôd see all day. <br>I stopped for dinner at the picnic table outside Matts Creek Shelter.

I had extra pep in my step bc today was the day I would get a fresh pair of trail runners delivered to Middle Creek Campground, at mile 758. <br>While at the campground, I loaded up on calories. I had a bacon double cheeseburger, fries, and 3 cookies-n-cream milkshakes. I packed out an additional cheeseburger and fries after spending an hour sunning myself (as best I could in the clouded sun) on the camp store deck. <br>After 4 miles I came to Bryant Ridge Shelter, one of the largest on the trail. I had begun to worry that the specter of the coronavirus would get worse in the trail as time went on, so I vowed to make this the last time I slept in a shelter. This was a good last hurrah. The shelter was a huge double decker w room for 20. As it turned out, there was plenty of room for social distancing. I shared the Shelter w Pan, Moshpit, Downhill, and Cascade. They were ‚Äúupstairs‚Äù, leaving me alone on the lower level.  #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020

Downhill and Moshpit we‚Äôre doing a zero there to celebrate Moshpit‚Äôs birthday. A little further on, at Black Horse Gap, the Trail began meandering along the Blue Ridge Parkway. Entire rhododendrons and mountain laurels were now in bloom.  #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020

So excited we crossed over the state line from GA to NC this morning.  One state down thirteen more to go. We were met with 4 big climbs today.  We had high hopes and expectations to make it to Franklin, NC by this Thursday.  However, while on our last decent, Cheryl stepped off a boulder onto a soft spot on the edge of the trail and took a fall down the mountain side about 5ft.  We praise God He broke her fall which could have been much farther down the ravine.  She was able to get up and make it down to a parking area for extraction.  God showed up and showed out with protection, a local hiker/trail magic to pull us out the back forestry road as the temps dropped and McKayla with girls were able to pick us up in Franklin.  There are so many ways He showed us He cares.  We shouldn't have had reception.  We shouldn't have been so close to a pull out.  She shouldn't have been able to walk out.  Cheryl is doing good in bed at home.  We'll give an update when we have it.<br><br>#at2020 #atlashers #atnobo2020 #2Chics4Feet #naturallife #bohobuff #womenwhohike #shewillmovemountains #hiking #atganc

The night preceding was a put on all your clothes, get in your sleeping bag at 4pm, and pray you don't have to poop anytime soon kind of night, our coldest night on trail for sure.<br><br>What followed involved walking 15 miles over 5,000 foot balds through a foot of snow and blizzard conditions, me in Altras with giant holes down to the socks and Posh in a Frogg Toggs rain suit with the crotch of the pants ripped wide open. So that was fun.<br><br>But we came down from the mountains to a cozy stay in a tree house and a breakfast of homemade pierogis and blueberry pancakes at Mountain Harbour B&B - definitely one of the best hostels on the AT so far, highly recommend!

I got a room at the Howard Johnson Express near the trailhead, did my laundry and showered. Today was my mother‚Äôs 78th birthday, and she lives at an independent living facility in nearby Roanoke, so I decided to surprise her. I called shuttle driver and AT hiker Wolverine, who immediately dropped his home improvement project and drove me to her. I called my mom from the parking lot, wished her a Happy Birthday, and told her to come out on her 3rd floor apartment deck. She was properly astonished - the ultimate birthday present from her thru hiker son. I did not plan my hike around her birthday, but sometimes the Universe conspires to make one‚Äôs timing impeccable. Later I joined a Zoom conference w my siblings and mom for a virtual birthday party. My ‚Äútramily‚Äù (Bender, Grace, Fonzie, Hot Sauce, and Tom) had joined me at HoJo, where we met up w Jello and Yardsale, who I had not seen since just after Neel Gap in Georgia. A day full of good cheer and mirth! #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020

It was getting pretty negative towards thru-hiking within the hiker community on here, and I took some time to consider if and how I wanted to continue to share my controversial thru-hike. Part of me felt weird about flaunting my travels while the world is in quarantine, to an audience made up of many AT 2020 NO-GO friends and peers.<br><br>I asked myself if staying on trail was selfish. And the answer was always, undeniably, yes. My decision is not uninformed, I know the counter-argument and it's a morally compelling one. This is not a stubborn rebellion to "stick it to The Man." Nor is it some kind of civil disobedience for civil liberties. Ok, in all honesty, maybe a tiny bit of the last one. But not primarily, and either way, it's still selfish.<br><br>So I stopped asking myself that question. Instead I asked: Is it ok that it's selfish? and, Is it ok that I don't justify or explain myself? The answers, I found, were also yes. I'm still out here because I need this exact thing in my life right now. There are no adequate substitutions. I don't need anyone to understand, respect, or "recognize" my thru-hike. Because it was always about me being at peace with myself, and that hasn't changed no matter what is happening in the world. When I hopefully stand on that Katahdin sign, I'll know that I did it and why I did it and that's enough for me.<br><br>I'm going to start posting again for those still interested, picking up from where I left off. As for a real time update, we are currently in Front Royal, VA. We are excited to hit mile 1,000 and finally leave VA this week.

There were too many people up here and it could have really turned into a crisis if a couple people with cabin fever had broken their ankles.‚Äù I understood. After a gracious day hiker had taken my picture (I gave her hand sanitizer) I relaxed in the beautiful sun. We hadn‚Äôt had sun like this the entire time I had been in the Trail. Part 2 of the triple crown achieved. I spent the rest of the afternoon hiking to Tinker Cliffs, where Joe, the owner of 4 Pines, had said there would be spectacular sunsets o er the Catawba Valley. I made it, and decided to pitch my tent and eat my dinner while I waited for Sol to sink in the West. Soon Fonzie, Bender, Tom, Grace, and Hot Sauce, who were fast becoming like ‚Äútramily‚Äù joined me for the viewing. It lived up to the billing. The 20-somethings then continued down the ridge to the next shelter, leaving me alone with the stars.  #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020

As it turned out, there wasn‚Äôt much sunrise today, but the view was amazing nonetheless. At the Tooth, a rocky outcrop that juts more than 30 feet above the surrounding ledge, I bumped into Always and Sunny, as well as Zebra. Since I was still some distance from the next town, Daleville, I decided to head for 4 Pines Hostel. On the way, I encountered my first blooming rhododendron.  Naturally, I took a picture, as did every other hiker, I have since learned. Once at 4 Pines, Nature Boy shuttled me to the nearby general store where I loaded up on cheeseburgers, pizza, and gathered (way too much) food for resupply. Later, Fonzie‚Äôs gang arrived, as did Fonzie‚Äôs dad, Brian, from Atlanta. Brian bought a cooler full of beer and soda for all to share. Later, I played several games of chess w Bender, a British hiker, and Jedi, from Germany. This hostel was set up in the bays of a 3-car garage and was a little dusty, so I did not use my supply of hand sanitizer sparingly. <br>#at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020

We hiked together for several miles, the first time I had done so since my 2nd day on the Trail w Southpaw. Eventually he moved in ahead as we crossed some ridge top ledges w views of the Catawba Valley to the East. This was A Tough Day At The Office for me. I slipped on a slab of ledge rock and banged my left shin, though not badly. Later, as I was fetching water from a stream, I slipped on the muddy bank and soaked both my feet. Then, I stubbed my toe while ascending onto a wooden bridge and went face down on it, banging my forehead. Luckily, I once again wasn‚Äôt hurt badly. I thought about how many other hikers had sprained their ankles, broken fingers or otherwise had been injured through a freakish misstep causing them to postpone or quit their hike, and I felt very lucky and grateful that I could continue. Late in the day I came up a small ridge to the Pickle Branch Shelter and the air was fragrant w t blossoms of spring. I camped in a clearing not far from the shelter and fell asleep to the sounds of wood thrush, whippoorwills, and a nearby babbling brook. #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020

The trail was fairly rocky for a long stretch, making the going slow. In the early afternoon a jet fighter swooped down over the valley to the west, banked and flew directly overhead, about 500 feet, then did a barrel roll as he headed east. The pilot circled around and made about a half dozen additional fly-bys, though none were as close as the first. I guess practicing your barrel rolls is one job that isn‚Äôt affected by coronavirus. I passed by Wind Rock, in the Mountain Lake Wilderness, which offered panoramic views of West Virginia. Late in the day I caught up with Fonzie, Tom, Tuck, Grace, Bender, and Hot Sauce, who had maxed out the capacity of the Laurel Creek Shelter. I was prepared for this, and headed just a short ways down the trail and camped on the former site of an old cabin in the del between two modest ridges. No sooner had I set up my tent than it started to rain. I crawled inside and prepared my dinner under the canopy of my rain fly vestibule. #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020

Bc I had stayed at hostels the last 4 days I had had a shower for a miraculous 4 straight days. That won‚Äôt happen again for a long time!  I hiked a lonely 20 miles at times high on a ridge that formed the VA/WV border. Towards late afternoon to Pine Swamp Branch Shelter and was a little apprehensive as I approached due to reports of a hiker (who shall remain nameless) who appeared a bit odd and who was last seen near Pine Swamp. Neville at Wood‚Äôs Hole had met him and assured us that he suffered from night terrors but was not dangerous. I was relieved when I got to the Shelter and found a merry band: Wiki, Jedi, and Owl Cat and her Jack Russell terrier PR. Waldo soon joined us. The shelter had a chimney and Wiki had quickly taken full advantage and made a very nice fire in the hearth. I pitched my tent nearby at a socially distant location.  #at2020thruhike #atthruhike #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020

Star headed back out to the Trail  in the morning. I made much needed repairs to my tent (once again fixed the broken zipper) and ordered a replacement pair of boots, which were to be delivered to me further up the Trail. I bought so much food at the nearby Food Lion that it wouldn‚Äôt fit into my food bag, so some lucky hiker behind me will be pleased when s/he opens the hiker pantry after my departure. #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020

I hiked out from Wood‚Äôs Hole in the morning and was eventually overtaken by Prophet and Wiki, though I caught them at the rock called Angel‚Äôs Rest, which offered a spectacular view of our destination and the New River Valley. The final mile and a half down to the town was steep and tough on my tired feet. I passed several day hikers (Angel‚Äôs Rest is a popular spot) and was picked up by Broccoli, who shuttled me to another Angel‚Äôs Rest, a hostel on the edge of town. The owner, Doc Peppa, had given me the Captain‚Äôs Rest for my accommodations. It‚Äôs a mobile home normally used by staff. I had use of the kitchen, living room, and full bedroom at the back. Later that day I was joined by Star, a nurse from Houston who had been section hiking and had gotten physically and mentally drenched in the rain to the north of us and had called Angel‚Äôs Rest to get a shuttle back to town to dry out and warm up in the 2nd bedroom. We had a nice chat comparing notes on the Trail (Star was an experienced hiker) got takeout from the Mexican restaurant up the way, and watching Netflix (a staffer had remained logged into the Roku). #at2020thruhike #atnobo2020 #atthruhike2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020

By mid-afternoon I arrived at Wood‚Äôs Hole, one of the oldest hostels on the trail and which has been owned by the Wood family since 1939 and maintained as a hiker hostel since 1986. Our hostess, Neville, was very mindful of the coronavirus and went out of her way to make sure everyone in the main cabin and the bunkhouse were mindful of proper social distancing. Once again,I got a private room. The accommodations and the food - Indian lentils, curry, rice, homemade chocolate chip cookies - were the most luxurious I had yet had on the Trail. Good company with friends old and new, including Always and Sunny, a couple from...Philadelphia (of course) made for a thoroughly enjoyable evening by the wood stove. <br>#atthruhike2020 #at2020thruhike #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020

It seemed to be coming from right below the shelter! I held very still and waited anxiously for the malodorous aroma to dissapate. In the morning I quietly, carefully fixed breakfast and hit the trail. After 600 miles, I was starting to feel like I would make it to Katahdin, as long as my luck would hold. The next town, Pearisburg, was still a ways off, so I planned to do a little hostel hopping to get there w/o needing to eat the dinners I had packed out. I made it to the aptly-named Weary Feet Hostel around noon time (the first one in for the day), and was treated to 2 cheeseburgers, fries, and (an entire pitcher) of delicious sweet tea. I got a private room and showered. Soon I was joined by Orange, Groot, Jedi, Owl Cat, and Wiki, among others.  #atthruhike2020 #at2020thruhike #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020

But coming between a thruhiker and their food bag is even more so. Afterwards I had some jim beam apple and 2 beef ramens with bacon pieces mixed in. Then slept like a baby. It's cold and raining right now. I'm camping in a spot with no water source so I've collected a few liters of water so far with my tarp. The rain really saps your energy. Maybe it'll be a short day to the next shelter. I'm 60 miles from Roanoke. I may zero there. We'll see.

Over the past 3 or 4 days I've run into 3 food stashes. I picked up ramen, snacks, French vanilla cappucino mix, sugar, pop tarts, moon pies, and more. A lot of thru hikers carry just enough to get to the next town for a resupply. And a lot of hikers are getting food shipped in because resupplies are harder with the beer flu. So these extra little bits of trail magic help get us from just getting by to being well fed. Also, beers at road crossings are clutch(big thanks to hungry and tigger). And lastly, thanks for picking up hitchhiking hikers. If you see one, give em a ride if you're going that way. I promise they'll have amazing stories to tell.

Passed under I-81 and then needed to cross the road - and someone was kind enough to stop to let me do so. .<br><br>At 18.3 miles into my day, I had to ford Lick Creek, where the bridge had washed out. It was about 30 feet across and only about a foot deep. I put my crocs on, tied my shoes to my pack, and easily made it across. It actually relieved my feet, which were aching a bit. .<br><br>As I walked up the field towards Chestnut Knob, the views of the mountains to the south and east got more and more spectacular. It was actually awe-inspiring, like being in a great cathedral of nature. <br>I reached the Chestnut Knob Shelter just before sunset. Just a few feet to the north was a view overlooking Burke‚Äôs Garden, a very unusual valley formed by a giant limestone sinkhole 8 miles long by 4 miles wide. The Shelter was on the rim of this sinkhole, and BG looked beautiful in the evening light. #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains #appalachiantrail2020

Nearby, signaling the promise of Spring, was a blossoming lilac; I have never seen one bloom so early (but then, this is southern Virginia). I followed the Trail ever closer to Interstate 81, and soon I could hear the roar of the trucks passing by. I came to the Relax Inn, just off the highway and booked a room. I did laundry and ordered what has quickly become my dinner staple in towns - pizza delivered to the door. There was a Mexican restaurant right up the street, but like so many other places, they‚Äôve closed their doors due to the coronavirus. <br>I made a few calls and learned that getting to my next destination - Pearisburg - was quite doable.

Rogers Visitors Center (very poor mobile reception here) and they‚Äôll deliver it to the Trailhead. I got 2 large zas and a 2 liter bottle of soda. I ate one and the other became dinner for the next two trail days. I shared the 2-liter w my fellow hikers. Later, Fonzie made a fire. Bc you cannot tent within a quarter mile of Partnership, I partook of the relatively spacious accommodations on the upper level. #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachianmountains

Rogers > Hurricane Shelter (515.1/+15.8) Awoke well before dawn to light rain. At first light I got my food bag down and prepared by breakfast under my tent‚Äôs rain fly vestibule. As I did so, the rain turned to sleet, then snow. Fortunately I was nestled underneath the pines. Unfortunately, when I moved to put my left boot on, about a half a cup of water poured out of it. Not a great beginning to the day. But, as the Trail taught me April 1st, I knew I could hike with a wet foot as long as the temperature didn‚Äôt stay below freezing and if I kept moving. <br>I broke camp and hiked across the rocky, and often bald Grayson Highlands. High winds whipped past me and seemingly through me. As I rounded a bend I came upon 5 wild ponies. They roam the Grayson Highlands freely. They looked calmly at me as if to say ‚ÄúWhat? You‚Äôre not unnerved by a little wind and snow, are you?‚Äù Right then I decided...no, I wasn‚Äôt unnerved at all. I had the right layers on, was generating enough heat as I hiked, and I knew where I was going. It was good to take note their example. The sun gradually vanquished the wind.  I camped across the Trail from the Hurricane Shelter‚Äôs side trail, near Hurricane Creek. #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachiantrail2020 #appalachianmountains

Rogers (499.3/+14.7) A little further down the trail I was overtaken by Pathfinder. I learned he was from Green Bay, and that his mother, a dental hygienist, had bought a 7‚Äô tall map of the AT, had hung it in an office wall, and was proudly tracking his progress for her coworkers. Eventually I crossed VA 600 and began my ascent into the Grayson Highlands, open grassy balds with incredible panoramic views of mountain ranges to the south and west. There were mountains as far as the eye could see! By mid afternoon I reached my goal - a camp site on a shoulder of Mt. Rogers called Thomas Knob. A wind was coming up, so I pitched my tent in the relative seclusion of a thick pine stand.  #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachiantrail2020 #appalachianmountains

Amazingly, Crazy Larry told me he had once worked as a cook - in Portland, Maine! - at a place called Bella Cucina‚Äôs! Very small world indeed. (There is much more to this story, but I‚Äôll save that for the book üòâ). The cottage was conveniently located up the street from the Subway, so I had two meals there (the diner was a longer walk and there was no guarantee my food would still be hot by the time I found a place to sit down and eat it). #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachiantrail2020 #appalachianmountains

I walked through the town. The park had been roped off with yellow police line and traffic cones, reminding me once again what a bizarre year 2020 had become. #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachiantrail2020 #appalachianmountains

The terrain was relatively easy to what I‚Äôd experienced so far, so this would be a good opportunity to do so.  I passed through a low area, traversed several wooden bridges over swampy land, crossed TN 91 and into a pasture that offered a stunning view of the valley to the southwest at twilight. As I sat on a stone bench overlooking this vista, I decided to reach down and pick up two small rocks as souvenirs for my kids. I would tell them about this view and that I thought of them at this moment. I pitched my tent as what seemed like a half dozen Baird owls hooted and cackled their displeasure at my encroachment on their hunting grounds. Exhausted, but very satisfied with my longest hike yet - 23.8 miles in one day - I quickly fell asleep.  #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachiantrail2020 #appalachianmountains

I fixed my typical instant oatmeal breakfast and Bob offered a cup of coffee. My plan was to ‚Äúslack pack‚Äù today past Laurel Fork Falls and over Pond Mountain to Boots Off Hostel, where a free Easter dinner was being planned for thru hikers. I‚Äôd carry one of Bob‚Äôs day packs, provisioned with snacks, water, and my rain gear, and he agreed to bring my pack to me at Boots Off, where owner Jim Gregory has invited him to stay for the meal. <br>It was an easy hike made easier by the much reduced weight on my back and I made the journey by mid-afternoon. After that I spent the rest of the day rekindling old acquaintances and making new friends. All told there were roughly 40 hikers at the feast. I would not have been surprised if we represented the majority of the thru hikers still on the trail. .<br>.<br><br>In attendance: Ryan + Nikki, French Press, Waldo, Viking, Pathfinder, Brian, Gracious, Ramble, Shotput, Blueberry, Empty Space, The Prophet, Bear, Captain Jack, Trip, and many more. <br>#at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachiantrail2020 #appalachianmountains

I put my rain jacket in over my puffy to help keep in the heat, and I pulled my clothing bag and my tent bag under my quilt to keep out drafts. I slept w my water filter. <br>The day slowly warmed and was bright. I broke camp and greeted two other hikers who had camped on the ridge above me. I moved on. The trail was noticeably well groomed. I paused by a bench that looked south over a field to Roan Mt. in the distance. Spectacular scene. Eventually I made it to Kincora, a hiker hostel 0.2 miles west of the trail. For 24 years Kincora has been run by Bob Peoples. Bob is a hiker‚Äôs hiker, and is a renowned titan of AT lore and culture. As he shuttled me to town for supplies, he regaled me with stories of other trails he has hiked around the globe, including the Camino Del Norte in Spain, the Jesus Trail in Israel, and the [trail in N Florida]. I was the only hiker staying at Kincora this evening. ‚ÄúIn all my years I‚Äôve never seen anything like this,‚Äù Bob said. ‚ÄúThe number of hikers coming through this time of year is way down.‚Äù #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachiantrail2020 #appalachianmountains

He was, and he advised me that the Mountaineer Shelter, a fairly new *triple-decker*, would be a good stopping point on the way to Kincora. It was. Excellent water source (the top of Mountaineer Falls), and, amazingly, I was the only one who stayed there. That being the case, I took up residence in the third story loft, as the night was forecast to be one of my coldest since Springer Mt. #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachiantrail2020 #appalachianmountains

The section from dicks creek gap to winding stair gap was weird and eerie and quiet for me, but this beautiful day in NC had some of the best views so far. Albert mountain was incredible and I felt so proud and at peace for reaching 100 miles, knowing if I could make it that far I could make it all the way. Being at home feels so normal that I forget that I was just out there, and then I watch these videos and feel deep pangs of sadness and fear that this opportunity won‚Äôt come again. I learned so many lessons that I‚Äôll take with me when I resume my hike eventually, for now I‚Äôm sitting on my couch wishing I had taken more pictures and videos üò≠<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#atnobo2020 #atclassof2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachiantrail2020 #at2020 #womenwhohike

I awoke to sporadic lightning and, fortunately, not much rain. On the way past the two high balls I had to clear though,there was a thick fog that made it difficult to see my pathway through the pre-dawn gloom. But I achieved my goal with 15 minutes to spare! Breakfast buffet menu: egg souffl√©, maple bacon hash browns, sausage, fresh fruits, tomato and mozzarella, various first-rate homemade pastries topped off with bottomless cups of coffee and orange juice (only partial breakfast pictured). I spent the rest of the day up the road at another hostel, The Station, where I got a private room, did laundry, showered, and even repaired my tent zipper, which had been broken for weeks (YouTube how-tos FTW!). #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachiantrail2020 #appalachianmountains

The plan was for another long hike, to Doll Flats (about 16 miles) which would put me 3 miles from where US 19E crosses the trail and very close to two good hostels. Hiked through the rain and the mist and the cold until I got to Overmountain Shelter, a large barn made to replicate one built during the time of the Overmountain Boys (revolutionary wars heroes from Carolina) and one which could accommodate an army of thruhikers until it was deemed structurally unsafe in 2019. Still, I decided to change my plans and camp here due to the spectacular view of the valley to the south with ridge upon ridge of mountains beyond. I decided to get up very early and ‚Äúfly by night‚Äù to Mountain Harbour B&B at US 19E 9 miles on for their ‚ÄúBest Breakfast on the Trail‚Äù before they closed their dining room at 9am. #at2020thruhike #atthruhike2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachiantrail2020 #appalachianmountains

Got caught in a flash thunderstorm shortly afterwards - I‚Äôve rarely seen so much water come down so fast - and my shorts got drenched. The storm ended quickly and air pressure seemed to rise for the rest of the day and eventually my shorts dried out nearly completely. <br>Towards the end of the day I began the long climb up Roan Mountain to Ash Gap. Gained 1500‚Äù of elevation over 3 miles. Made pretty good time, however, and got to the gap by 5pm. I was very proud of my hike today. <br>Waldo was the only other person I had seen all day.

Figure it‚Äôs about time I talk about it for those who didn‚Äôt see my story. .<br>.<br>.<br>Well, March 16, dad and I had just arrived at Nantahala. Excited and tired, we restocked and got a well deserved burger. Unfortunately, due to what is going on in the world, we were requested to come back to Canada. To cement this request, our insurance was cutting us off. It was tough news. Seriously tough news. So we rented a car, and drove home. You have no idea how much it sucks (unless of course you‚Äôre one of our fellow thru-hikers. Odds are, you‚Äôre off the trail now too.) We plan to hike it again (from the start again) next year. We‚Äôre already planning. I‚Äôll probably be posting some odd photos that I had planned to post before. But beyond that, please stay safe and healthy everyone. To my fellow thru-hikers, I‚Äôll see you on the trail next year! .<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #nobo2020 #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail2020 #appalachiantrailnobo2020 #hiking #camping #outdoors #adventure #thruhiker #thruhike

This is such a picture I was sitting on the other half of this tree resting ,<br>with the trail in between. So many trunks of trees were lying along the trail I rested on as many as I could some I sat on others I backed up to and rested my pack on without having to take it off. Many were my small goal just make it to the tree trunk then the next and so on went the day. I had water and snacks on them sometimes with others but mostly alone, somebody tied my shoes for me while sitting on a log that kindness will never be forgotten. Only a few days on the trail changes a person and I also want to thank you trail maintainers for all the work you doü§óI saw a stair a cut log a bridge a rock placed for me to step on everywhere, thanks.<br>#atclassof2020 <br>#at2020thruhike #atnobo2020 #atnogo2020 #atthruhike2020 #at2020 #hike #womenwhohike #appalachiantrail #appalachiantrail2020 #hikegeorgia #appalachiantrailclassof2020 #trees #hikersofinstagram

It was a life changing experience. There were only a handful of other hikers that made it in and they were the only other people I saw the whole time. Except for the first day which was rainy, it was sunny and 80 the rest of the 5 days. It only went down to the 50s or 40s at night. From all I've heard, the weather we experienced is the best anyone could get. I hit 18.7 miles on the day I summited clingmans dome(the highest point on trail). I found my trail legs in the smokies and I'll be ditching my trekking sticks soon. Getting in and out of the smokies before it shut down was like surfing on a tsunami. It was the last ride out, but a hell of a ride.

Food is always on the brain. Fantasizing at 9am about what flavor tuna packet you're going to have for lunch. McDonald's chicken nugs invading your dreams at night. Mountain Houses becoming suspiciously more delicious. Depending on Sour Patch Kids to coax your tired ass up a steep incline.<br><br>2. Darn Tough socks live up the their name after a few days, petrified stiff by sweat, mud, blister juice, attempts to launder them in streams and dry them on your pack on a cold, cloudy day. Only to be revived by a motel washer & dryer and more than one Tide pod.<br><br>3. Day hikers emit a sweet fragrance when they pass you. You wonder if your animalistic sense of smell is evolving or if they're just noticably potent in comparison to your funk of weekly showers and month of forgoing deodorant.

Post trail depression hit me hard the last few days and just being in a group chat with these guys brightens my day up so much. Missing the trail and not getting to keep hiking has really sucked. But I know it was the best decision to postpone until it is safe. So I just want to thank my tramily for keeping me sane and being such a great support system.

It felt like forever before I could see Mountain Crossings. The first thing I did was buy a Banana and get a cup of hot coffee. I sat around and talked with others about the Morning hike. Then time to order that pizza and get a room in the bunk house. I got the last bed üëèüèº pizza came and I was so excited. Four slices later I was stuffed üòÇ I guess hiker hunger was not there, it never came for me I was not on trail long enough darn it . Anyway .. the bunk house... I got the last bunk it was a top bunk under the air ducts with about 8inches head space. Showered settled in and got comfy with everyone. The room had a huge selection of old VHS the group chose a 1934 black&white Bride of Frankenstein movie to watch üòú. Bedtime 8:30. Then the snore symphony began. At around 4am I could not get back to sleep with all the noise so in the dark I somehow managed to climb of the bunk and after walking into another bunk finally found the door to the living room another hiker was asleep there so I slept with my feet in a cabinet on the kitchen floor üòÇ. I paid $20 for that experience and would do it again in a heartbeat üëäTHANK YOU MOUNTAIN CROSSING.

Many hikers have quit or put their hike on hold, disheartened by the idea of having to skip over a celebrated portion of the trail. I began planning to go as far as Fontana Dam, on the southern edge of the Smokies, and find transportation around them, then return later to complete the section when the park reopens. This morning the situation shifted once again, and I heard that on March 27th the county where Fontana Dam is located is going to put a police barricade on the trail, and won‚Äôt admit any hikers. I‚Äôm sort of proud- in all my years traveling with punk bands, I‚Äôve never had an entire county call the cops on us two days in advance! Fortunately, I should be able to get a shuttle from the Nantahala Outdoor Center tomorrow.<br><br>If you try to beat the Trail, the Trail will beat you; I can‚Äôt control anything that‚Äôs happening, only how I choose to respond. Having started this journey SOBO, I signed up for adventure, a challenge, and a transformative experience- not hostels, trail magic, or partying with a big bubble of other hikers. I came here ready to accept the unexpected, and that‚Äôs what I intend to continue doing.<br><br>#appalachiantrail #atnobo2020 #atsobo2020 #atcobo2020 #walkingwithspring #hikenorthcarolina #wayahbald #stairsinthewoods #naturephotography #ospreypacks #withguthook #trektheat #appalachiantrials #acceptanceistheanswer #gratitude #positivementalattitude #fuckthepolice

Shivering and battling hypothermia, I hiked 3.5 miles to the Fontana Hilton where I stripped down naked in front of everyone at 7am. My fiancee is overnighting my old, trustworthy @keltybuilt tarp that I'll pick up today and I'll be a happy camper again.<br><br>This shelter is gorgeous with nice amenities. There's a spigot. There were toilets and a shower before the Corona virus had them locked.(almost locking my charger in there where it was charging) There's a broken solar charger. The views are one of the best I've seen yet out of a shelter. I won't be staying at many more shelters, if any, but staying a night at the Fontana Hilton was definitely worth it.

Prior to this point, our longest backpacking trip was only 50 miles. You hear the statistics that one in four don't make it the entire way and I remember thinking there was a possibility we may be in that 25 percent. I remember being at the lodge the night before and staring up at the 20ft map of the trail spanning 2,192 miles and thinking "are we really going to walk that entire way?".<br>‚Ä¢<br>There were definitely several times I physically and mentally wanted to quit and felt like giving up. The blisters, the chafing, the rocks in PA, the suffocating heat, the mosquitoes in MA..to name a few struggles. Each day brought it's own challenges, but each day brought it's own beauty. A new mountain to climb, a new person to meet, a new view to take in, a new conversation.<br>‚Ä¢<br>It's so easy to go about our daily lives now and watch as days turn into weeks that blur past us. The trail makes you feel present. I feel like I can remember small moments so vividly. A single day on trail holds so many memories. We will always miss the simplicity, but we will try to live as simple as the trail does.<br>‚Ä¢<br>I can't imagine how different things would be right now if we didn't decide to quit our jobs and take off on the biggest adventure of our lives. The trail truly ruined us for the best and we couldn't be more thankful for the people we met, the memories we made and the moments we will never forget.<br>‚Ä¢<br>Our hearts hurt for those who planned to hike this year and aren't able to do so. However, we commend the difficult decision you made by staying home, because as health care workers we like to see others do their part in stopping this virus as well. If you are already on the trail please try to isolate yourself, don't sleep in shelters, avoid hostels, or maybe consider getting off trail and trying next year. The trail will always be there.<br>‚Ä¢<br>#appalachiantrail #appalachiantrail2020 #ATthruhike #atnobo2020 #thruhike #thruhiking #thruhikers #atclassof2019 #nobo #appalachiantrail2019 #hiking #nursing #travelnurse

Hostels, restaurants, and other business in trail towns are closing. The NOC before the Smokies is closed. The NOC in Gatlinburg, TN is open only to thru-hikers, who must enter one at a time escorted by an employee. All REIs have closed. Mountain House is out of Mountain House. The ATC has issued a statement encouraging those planning a thru-hike to postpone and current thru-hikers to get off trail.<br><br>All that considered, Posh and I are pushing on. Some thru-hikers we follow and/or have met in person are starting to make the call to leave the trail, as they feel it's the responsible or ethical thing to do. We don't know the correct response to this unprecedented situation and fully respect others' decisions, no matter their choice.<br><br>We feel that being on trail allows us to adequately do our part in social distancing. Being in the woods and mountains most of the time, we come into contact with fewer individuals on a daily basis, and fewer different individuals, as we are generally hiking in a bubble of the same people.<br><br>Certainly fewer than we'd interact with if we were to travel via multiple forms of public transportation back home to CT and patronize the various public places in our populous home towns. We'd also be spending most of our time with our 50/60-something year old parents, who are more at risk of contracting the virus if we happened to carry it home with us.<br><br>There are responsible and ethical things we can do as hikers if we choose to continue. Avoiding physical contact and sharing food or gear. Maintaining the best hygiene possible. Going into towns less frequently and limiting the businesses we enter to only those necessary. Taking zeros at shelters rather than at hotels or hostels. Tenting instead of sleeping in shelters.<br><br>The AT is a challenging hike, physically and mentally. For the class of 2020, we are beginning to see logistical challenges come into play. So we'll do our best to adapt and figure things out as we go. For now, until we start to see resources at resupply points become scarce and/or mail drops become impossible to receive, we are continuing to Katahdin.

We made it to the 100 mile marker. It was such an amazing milestone but the day was so bittersweet. It was my last day hiking on the Appalachian Trail.. for now.. I have decided to postpone my thru-hike due to the coronavirus pandemic. With hostels and shuttles shutting down, I don‚Äôt want to put strain on the smaller communities that already have limited resources and an a typical older community and putting them at risk or risk exposing myself. I will be going back home to Texas for the time being and plan to come back later this year and attempt a SOBO hike or flip flop.  I‚Äôm going to miss my tramily but I know we will be together soon. Until next time Appalachian Trail. .<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #AT2020 #ATnobo2020 #appalachiantrail2020 #appalachianlife #ATclassof2020 #trektheat #thetrek #hikemoreworryless #optoutside #hikertrash #thruhike #hikerlife #getlost #backpacking #hikerlife #outdoorlife #hiking #adventure #wanderlust

Whereas it‚Äôs frustrating to plan a major life event for years, exercise, lose 35 lbs, acquire gear and (some) knowledge, logistics, etc ...l believe it‚Äôs the right decision for me. It does feel selfish / shitty to be this disappointed though. It is not lost on me AT ALL this is a global crisis with deaths, as well as jobs/ savings lost. My heart goes out to those impacted!  Maybe the world will take a cue from the supportive nature of the hiker community and pull together.  I am speaking solely for myself here, and hope that as others make decisions regarding hikes etc that it brings them peace of mind, and safe travels.  I do think we may need a new hashtag... how about #atclassof2020ish ?  In any event the AT mountains and trails aren‚Äôt going anywhere, and for the moment neither am I.  #peace #atclassof2020 #atnobo2020 #thetrek #NotAHoax #hiker #hikertrash #whiteblaze #nobo #atnobo #zpacks #rei #appalachiantrailclassof2020 #guthookguides  #georgiatomaine #trektheat #planb #liteaf #seatosummitgear #bigagnes #enlightenedequipment #planetfitness

Becoming hikertrash is a transition no hiker will soon forget. From airing out sleeping bags and dirty socks in hostel rooms to binging on all you can eat pacake breakfast at mom and pop diners along the way, thruhikers are both an eye sore and a beloved sight in trail towns. But for the 2020 NOBO hikers on any long distance trail this month or next, you may be looking at a very different reality. In light of COVID19 should we be on the trail or staying home?

Buttercup gave us a ride into Helen, Georgia. We had to pick up meds for Tuna's cold and resupply food. Helen Georgia is a cute little Alpine Village with a lot of tourists and locals. We met a local man that was a veteran. We were able to speak openly and share stories of how suicide can affect so many people. Our new friend shared how he was affected by the loss of a loved one that died by suicide. He also has a close friend that struggles with mental health issues. He had not spoken with his close friend in a couple of weeks. He was more determined, after we spoke, to reach out  and "check in" with his friend. These experiences, make every cold rainy day and  muddy,  slippery step worth the journey. If you haven't reached out to a loved one you feel may need an emotional "check in", please reach out today.  It may make all the difference in their world. #appalachiantrailclassof2020 #appalachiantrail #atnobo2020 #thruhike #thruhiker #whiteblaze #thetrek #suicideprevention #preventsuicide #preventsuicidepa #mentalhealthawareness #mentalhealthmatters #thehappinessproject #hikeoutsuicide #americanassociationofsuicidology

We got off trail on Sunday for Cash to heal up and gain some weight back. Did some trail magic but it ended up being a magical week for us as well. We made friends with a park ranger, on the way to Standing Bear to go SOBO into the Smokies, we stopped for lunch at @docs321cafeandmarket where we ended up staying for 4 hours. Just a great place. Still on the way we found a cool little hippy shop and a moonshine distillery, more magic. We made it to Standing Bear hostel where we met some cool cats that are in a band together so it turned into a jam session, and I linked back up with some great people that I would love to call tramily...Hopefully.  Tonight we are in a hotel and hitting the trail again tomorrow.  This is a great life. Good food and good souls to hangout with in some of the most beautiful places in the world. *The last picture was taken about this time in 2017. This year I‚Äôm in a Tshirt and it feels great.

We were welcomed into NC with a rough 1000 feet of incline over a mile but then were rewarded with some great blue mountain views and a sunset from a viewpoint near Muskrat Creek Shelter. The AT has a way of testing you and then making it all worth it.

(Fingers crossed we catch bad up to each other! ü§ûüèº) We made it to the top of Blood Mountain and the views were amazing. It is oldest shelter on the AT made of all rocks! We hung out for a bit and then made sure to eat our takeaway ‚ÄúWhite Blaze‚Äù Brownies. (Thanks Lucky! @atchostel) The climb down Blood Mountain was brutal. Both of my achilles were in so much pain by the time we got to Neel Gap. I couldn‚Äôt walk very well. But it was a great last day with my dad and can‚Äôt wait to see him again!

It was a bit chilly up at the top but the view was worth it. We met up with some people we met at the shelter the night before and hiked with them all day. We found a waterfall that was stunning. It was worth the .10 mile detour. We made it to Hawk Mountain Shelter and set up camp, ate dinner and then crawled into bed early. It was extremely cold and I think it was about 25 that night but wind chill made it even colder. But we survived! I think I may have found a tramily! .<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>#appalachiantrail #AT2020 #ATnobo2020 #appalachiantrail2020 #appalachianlife #ATclassof2020 #trektheat #thetrek #hikemoreworryless #optoutside #hikertrash #thruhike #hikerlife #getlost #backpacking #hikerlife #outdoorlife #hiking #adventure #wanderlust

Yesterday's total was 11.7 miles and my knees feel like my IT band soreness is over! I encountered my first trail magic yesterday. I had a hot dog and a few beers. While walking this morning a couple passed by me and said they heard about wylde's fabled pants. Word has been spreading up and down the trail of my pants haha. I had a short hike to rt 60 where I hitched a ride with Wubby into Dahlonega. He drove me to walmart to resupply and dropped me off at dunkin so I can grab some lunch and recharge. He even had a cold beer for me! When I'm done I'll hitch back to the trail where there's more people cooking up some trail magic! I'd like to put in a few more miles when I get back so I hope I'm not in town too long.

Between walking and surviving rain, sleet, and freezing temps, I haven't been able to get many pics. But pics can't really do the experience justice anyway. It's probably 20 degrees out right now so I spent the night in a shelter at Hawk Mountain with 20 other people. I need to resupply in town in 2 days. Today I'll be heading to Gooch shelter 8 miles away. Hopefully my IT band in my knee doesn't get worse. Phoenix gave me some tiger balm and I'll take some aspirin. I'm camping with a guy that was walking barefoot yesterday. He's wyld.

Second part of the day was a gross 40 degrees and raining so we pushed past a couple campsites to get out of the weather into Deep Gap Shelter.

JK. I ordered these. I get it. ‚ÄúThe AT is always a short hitch to a town or resupply point.‚Äù ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs plenty of food you can buy in towns.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll never go hungry.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre wasting money by doing resupply boxes.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to waste time waiting on the post office in town.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou can survive on peanut butter and snickers!‚Äù Etc. Etc. Yeah someone actually said that last one to me. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è There‚Äôs so much divisiveness when it comes to the topic of resupplying on trail. For those NOT in the backpacking world, hikers tend to be very opinionated on all topics related to trail, especially resupply. üòÇ Understandably so. When it comes to resupplying, the consensus does usually fall on the side of saving boxes and buying in town. But for me, it‚Äôs not entirely possible. (Have I mentioned I have celiac disease? AND I‚Äôm a dietitian?!) Sure, I COULD survive on peanut butter, snickers, cheetos, nuts, etc. All are gluten free! But why would anyone want to?! Being celiac in ‚Äúreal life‚Äù is tough as it is. On trail, I can only imagine it will be worse. I don‚Äôt want to get caught in a small town without nutritious, gluten free food. I might be the exception to the resupply ‚Äúrules‚Äù, but I challenge everyone to evaluate their food choices for the adventure ahead! Eat crap = feel like crap. I‚Äôm FINALLY done prepping all of my trail dinners. Next up, is finishing breakfasts, coffees, and some snacks. Are you sending yourself anything in a resupply box?! PS- this is more boxes than necessary. I just wanted some size options for different lengths between resupplies! #atthruhike #atthruhike2020 #thruhike #thruhiker #thetrekat #thetrek #atnobo2020 #atnobo #celiac #glutenfree #dietitian

Our Gooch Group was on trail by 4:30, trying to hike as much of our 15 mile day as we could before the rain came. Found our first trail magic at Woody Gap and caught the sunrise over the first good view we've seen on the AT (pictured). Rest of the day was a rainy cold mess summiting and descending Blood Mountain. But the first part of our group left us a note in the shelter on top saying they got us all cabins, where I'm happy to be writing from.

I've used the #coleman headlamp on the left for more than 10 years. (This one is my second) But it uses 3 AAA batteries and is little heavy. I upgraded to the #nitecore NU20. It's lighter and charges with a micro USB cable. It will also operate while plugged into a battery bank if it dies.<br><br>I upgraded from a 6700 mAh #Anker charger to a 10000 mAh one. I didn't like how many charges I got out of the 6700. (1 to 2 charges) I used to have a 10k anker but it was stolen out of my car. The 10k is also a quick charger and takes a USB C input, the same kind I use for my phone. So I can use the same cable for charging my brick and my phone. The small micro usb will be used rarely to charge the headlamp.<br><br>Weight-wise the upgrades are a wash. The headlamp is lighter but the battery pack is heavier. I won't need disposable batteries though and the light can be used even if it dies. I'll also get more juice out of the bigger battery meaning more days between heading into town. I'm hoping I can make it 3 or so days between towns.<br><br>#atnobo #atnobo2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachiantrail2020 #hikertrash #ultralight #camping #hiking #gear #thruhike #withguthook #optoutside @nitecoreflashlight @colemanusa @anker_official

Three days was nice to chill after driving for days.

I like the colors and I‚Äôm considering wearing it on the AT. But I also wanted to knit another colorful hat with a white blaze on it. I was looking for yarn to do that when I found this in my stash. I probably don‚Äôt want polyamid in a hat. I don‚Äôt know for sure what it is, but I have a feeling it won‚Äôt dry fast. <br>When we were having lunch at a cheese shop, I saw the @opinelofficiel knife display and decided I needed it for the trail. I carried the little Swiss tool before and it really couldn‚Äôt cut cheese, summer sausage or spread almond butter. üòÇüòÇ The Opinel is lighter I think.

Matt is still in the process of finalizing his gear since he‚Äôs been so busy with work up until now, (unlike some of us that have been funemployed for the past month and a half...) So I figured I‚Äôd share all of my gear and all of our shared gear we‚Äôll be starting with on the AT.<br><br>I created a Lighter Pack gear list (link in bio) if you‚Äôre interested in more detail on any of this. We haven‚Äôt figured out how we‚Äôre splitting up all the shared gear yet, and it will probably fluctuate for the first few weeks as we experiment with how much weight we each feel comfortable carrying. I‚Äôm predicting my actual base weight will be around 15/16 pounds (and Matt‚Äôs slightly higher), but for now I just put all of the gear in these photos on my LP list with the shared items starred. I‚Äôm also not trying to obsess over numbers, as long as we‚Äôre both comfortable it‚Äôs all good.<br><br>I made some notes in Lighter Pack to explain some of the discounted prices on a few items I bought secondhand, either through REI Used Gear, on @poshmark (clothing/home goods resale app) or at thrift stores. Would highly recommend checking these out if you haven‚Äôt already - they‚Äôre great options both for sustainability and saving some money.<br><br>The last photo shows the base and mid layers I plan to swap out for once the weather warms up (at some point past the Smokies) and my extra pairs of trail runners I plan to replace about every 500 miles. I also have a rain poncho I may end up using in the summer lieu of hot and sweaty rain gear, but I‚Äôm still up in the air about what works for me.<br><br>Feeling pretty good about what I‚Äôm starting with after a lot of research and switching things up many times over the past few months. Still open to any advice from past/present thru-hikers on here!

I‚Äôm fortunate enough to be in a position in life to decide few month ago that I will take a break from the corporate world. I‚Äôll be attacking a new mental/challenge. I‚Äôve decided I will be thru-hiking the entire Appalachian Trail starting on February 23rd. This hiking trail runs from Springer Mountain, GA to Mt. Katahdin, ME encompassing 2,193 total miles. This long trail typically takes hikers 4-7 months to complete with an average success rate of only 25%. I can‚Äôt wait! I will also be a contributing vlogger for @thetrek.co during my journey. My first few videos should be uploaded in the next week to their YouTube channel. I will also be posting updates and photography on my own social media. See you out on the trail!<br><br>#atclassof2020 #thruhike #thruhiker #thruhiking #appalachiantrailclassof2020 #at2020 #atNOBO2020 #appalachiantrail

I just finished watching Free Solo and feel exactly how @alexhonnold felt before his solo of El Capitan. I've spent years planning this thru hike. I've worn only trail runners for the past year. I pored over fabric types, gear, ounces, and even grams. I saved up and quit my job. Laser focus. I'm ready, heart, mind, body, and soul.

This year the girls are sporting blue! Let‚Äôs take a look!<br><br>This Haley seems to be doing a repeat of last year! Like Kate Middleton, Haley is not afraid to rewear styles that are timeless, elegant, and really show her true personality! This year we see a couple changes, from leggings to jogger pants! To go with the extra cozy she added a golden hat! She‚Äôs golden on the outside and the inside! Is the golden hat a sign she will go home with a golden statue?<br><br>We thought is couldn‚Äôt be done, but here she goes again! Tina is stunning crowds in shades of blue. Should we say 50 shades of blue? (naughty). Tina has never been one to conform and tonight is no different. Comfort fashion is defined by Tina and we warn others who try to copy cat that they probably won‚Äôt be able to pull off this comfort-chic aesthetic as effortlessly as Tina does each year. The Oscars have seen perfection and perfection is spelled T-I-N-A.<br><br>#oscars #singleladies #soontobe #hikertrash #at2020 #appalachiantrail #appalachiantrail2020 #atnobo2020 #funnygirls

I am excited to announce that on March 10th I‚Äôll be heading down to Georgia to attempt my thru hike of the Appalachian Trail! <br>For those of you who don‚Äôt know what that is, the AT is a ‚Äúmarked hiking trail in the Eastern United States extending between Springer Mountain in Georgia and Mount Katahdin in Maine. The trail is about 2,200 miles (3,500&nbsp;km) long, though the exact length changes over time as parts are modified or rerouted. The Appalachian Trail Conservancy describes the Appalachian Trail as the longest hiking-only trail in the world.‚Äù On average, it takes 6 months and 5 million steps to complete.<br><br>For those looking to follow along on my journey, I‚Äôll be planning to do most of my updating, for now, on my instagram @karsonmadole<br><br>I love talking about the AT and my prep so if anyone has any questions feel free to comment below or message me!<br><br>#ATCLASSOF2020 #ATNOBO2020 #at2020 #atclassof2020 #appalachiantrail #zpacks #hyperlitemountaingear @zpacks #hmgtribe @hyperlite_mountain_gear

It has been a year filled with loss, grief, and unexpected change. I have been blessed to be on staff with Cru the past 11 years and in the fall the Lord made it clear that this part of life was coming to a close. It‚Äôs been quite shocking and sad as I thought I would be on staff forever. The Lord is funny sometimes and likes to do things like that. I will be ending my time with Cru at the end of February and moving into an ‚Äúin between‚Äù time as I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôm heading next. At the end of March Tina and I will be embarking on a thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail! It‚Äôs something we have dreamed of for several years now and a gap of time has opened for that to happen. It will be much needed time to process what‚Äôs next as well as the last 11 years of ministry. Don‚Äôt worry! You will be able to keep up with the hike as we will be vlogging our adventure for The Trek! We applied and got accepted and now have this awesome online platform to share it from! Thank you to all the ministry partners over the years who have trusted the Lord and prayed for me in my ministry with Cru! God did so many awesome things and I look forward to seeing and hearing what he continues to do through the ministry of Cru. I ask for continued prayers as I finish out and process what‚Äôs next. I‚Äôm excited for this gap of time and to share a little bit of that time with you! <br>You may have a lot of questions or may be curious about how you can help as many people have asked that. Feel free to ask questions and check out this gear list of small items I put together on Amazon. Link in bio.<br><br>Again, thank you for all the love and support.

One time a few hikers stayed overnight on the cottage floor and they smelled BAD, but that‚Äôs all I really remember.<br><br>I never thought someday I would be one of those thru-hikers.
